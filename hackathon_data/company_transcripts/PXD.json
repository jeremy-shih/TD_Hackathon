Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Thank you, Yolanda. Good day, everyone and thanks for joining us for our second quarter call. I'm going to briefly review the agenda that we're going to go through today. Tim's going to be up first. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the second quarter of this year and our latest outlook for the remainder of 2017. After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance in Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and he'll provide an update on drilling plans for the remainder of 2017 in this area.","Ken will then discuss the limited drilling program we have underway in the Eagle Ford Shale this year. And lastly, Rich will highlight our initiatives to lock in additional oil pipeline takeaway capacity to the Gulf Coast to cover our increasing Spraberry\/Wolfcamp oil reduction. He'll also summarize the second quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the third quarter. After that, we'll, of course, as we always do each quarter, open the call up for questions that the group may have. ","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy Dove","Thanks, Frank. And I hope everybody is enjoying what's left of their summer. Our second quarter results were really quite good. We hit the top of our production range. We lowered our production costs. We've added some very attractive hedges uphill, especially on oil for 2018. And we're staying right on track from a capital perspective. You can see that on the first slide, where we cover our financial and operating highlights.","In particular, we had second quarter income, after you take out the effects of mark-to-market gains and unusual items, of about $38 million or $0.21 per diluted share. That was well above consensus for the quarter. Production came in at the top end of our range, about 259,000 BOE per day. And without the POP delays I'll discuss later, we would've been substantially over the top of that guidance range. This reflected an increase, of course, during the quarter of about 10,000 barrels a day, up 4% from last quarter. And that's our ninth consecutive year -- quarter of growth since 2014 when the downturn commenced.","Of course, second quarter growth continues to be driven by what's been really outstanding drilling results in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal program. Production increased 12,000 BOE a day or about 6% quarter-over quarter. Internal rates of return in the play continue to be strong at 50% or 55%. We'll talk more about that in a couple of slides. ","We have continued to see our production cost decline. It has a lot to do, especially when you take out taxes, when you just focus on the operating cost of the field, they were mixing in the higher percentage of Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal wells that averaged about $2.23 per quarter -- $2.23 per BOE for the quarter and they reduced our overall cost to about $6.19. That's a reduction both from a year ago at $6.79 and even from the last quarter at $6.31. So that's a very positive thing we're seeing on operating cost.","We did see opportunities to hedge and I'm pleased about that, of course. We saw in -- actually slightly ahead of the OPEC meeting, an opportunity, an uptick in prices that allow us to do some hedging. And then recently, over the past couple of weeks, in response to what's been happening on the inventory front, we added about 51,000 BOE -- barrels of oil per day. This is oil derivatives for 2018. Those were struck at our typical three-way collar structure of 35, 45, 55. So that puts our overall portfolio average collars about 39, 49, 59. So it gives us quite a good deal of protection for 2018 pricing.","In fact, our derivatives now cover about 90% of our forecasted areas for this year and about 80% of our gas and about 50% now in terms of oil coverage for next year and about 15% for gas. More details, of course, are in the back. But we'll look to do more hedges in 2018 as we look for attractive opportunities to do so in the next few months. We'd like to be significantly higher than 50%. ","Our balance sheet and debt metrics continue to be industry leading. Substantial amount of cash on hand. Very low debt statistics.","Turning now to Slide 4. We placed 61 wells on production, horizontal wells in the Permian Basin. That was in line with our range of 60 to 65 for the quarter. I will talk about the weighting of those. A lot of those were actually at the end of June. Of those wells, 9 were using the bigger fracs than our 3.0 completions and we're seeing very encouraging results so far.","Of course, these are using anywhere up to 100 barrels per foot of fluid and 5,000 pounds per foot of proppant. And we've seen significant increases of production over a 3.0 version. So at some point, we may want to call this 4.0, but we'll see. The fact is, we're actually looking at upping the number of 3.0+ wells we complete as we finish the year. Incidentally, when we talk about the effects of going from 3.0 to 3.0+, we're increasing both oil and gas production when we do so.","Four of those wells that we completed in the quarter were in the Jo Mill. We continue to see very good results from the Jo Mill. We have POP'd now several wells, both this quarter and prior quarters and these suggest that they'll be included in higher numbers in the future drilling because the results have been so strong. The rest of the wells we completed were typical Version 3.0 completions which is now our default and they continue to outperform the earlier 2.0 style completions. Joey, of course, will have a lot more color on that as we get back to his slides. ","In the Eagle Ford, we placed our 4 DUC wells. Those were wells that were drilled, but uncompleted. Those were wells drilled in late 2015 and early '16 on production and they're really showing good performance. They're outperforming nearby offset wells that didn't have such intense completions by over 25%, in some cases over 25%, after 50 days or so of production. And Ken will talk more about that on his slide. ","Permian exports continue to be strong and they actually will be increasing substantially through time as our oil production continues to move forward and up. We exported 1 million barrels to Europe in the second quarter and expect to export another 1 million barrels to Europe and Asia in the third quarter. And those volumes will be increasing through time.","Going now to Slide 5. As I address Slides 5 and 6, I want you to know that one of the main messages for today is that there are no fundamental structural changes to this field, that is the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal field or our business plans. The wells continue to improve. Oil production's on target per well and we're actually benefiting from more gas and NGLs. Our unexpected drilling and POP delays were unfortunate, but we're addressing those.","So what I'd like to do is just give an update on some of these topics. And also, at the end, we'll make some comments regarding how we're approaching 2018. We continue to operate the 18 rigs in the field. Of course, we've been running 14 in the North and 4 in the South for some time now. The drilling program continues, as I mentioned, to be mostly focused on 3.0 completions. Although we're testing some larger completions in May, as I mentioned earlier, increase that number. ","The returns for the program look very good. We're using a range right now of 40% to 75%. Now that's based on $50 oil. You recall that in the past, we used a $55 case and we generated 50% to 100% returns. Those returns still apply. But what we're saying is the returns are still quite strong in the field and that's why our activity continues. ","I mentioned earlier the Eagle Ford. We're now in the process of drilling and completing the total package of 11 new wells that we're drilling and the 9 wells that were DUCs from that late '15 and early '16 time period. But we didn't complete those on time, of course, because the economics really weren't very favorable to do so. But the objective, as I mentioned many times, is to test longer laterals, put -- at wider spacing and put higher-intensity completions, somewhat more like Permian style completions on these wells. And we're hopeful we'll begin to see some results. ","Actually, we'll see over the next 2 months -- 2 to 3 months, a lot of the new drills being completed and put on production. In fact, 2 of the wells are on production, but there's not enough data to see it yet. But that's really going to be interesting to see because it will help frame our future in the Eagle Ford. We have returns in that field that are really currently expected at in that same $50 case, $53, to be about 35% to 45%.","We mentioned this in all the slides and such, but we did fall behind operationally on our completions in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp in large part due to unforeseen drilling delays. What happened is the delays were really the result of unexpected changes in pressure regimes in the field. So what we've seen is increasing pressures in some of the shallow formations. It means we have too mud up substantially to deal with that problem. And then we immediately then are drilling in the lower-pressure depleted zones and we were at a nice edge of this for -- really through all of 2016.","But these pressures are changing -- changed in a subtle manner, such that we now find we have a higher percentage of what we kind of refer to as train wreck wells, where we have all kinds of problems with loss circulation and other issues because of this pressure change. The easiest way to remediate this is with a drilling plan that takes us from a 3-string casing design to a 4-string casing design. So that's exactly what we've done. We've solved this issue. We have addressed it and we've done so by changing the casing design which has proven to be very successful.","And one thing it does is it does increase the well cost substantially, about $300,000 to $400,000 per well. And this increase our time of drilling to 5 days or so. But we're also a nickel and diming away other costs in these wells to try to get that money back, including changing out surfactants and other things to try to reduce cost and reduce days. So we're not going to stand pat with this increase. We're going to chip away at it and reduce it. ","Cumulatively, though, what happens is, because we've impacted the schedule, we've also then reduced the number of POPs we're going to be completing this year by about 30. Those are essentially moving in to 2018. That's 100% due to these drilling delays I mentioned which I believe we now have mitigated. But you had to also factor in the delays not only result in deferral of wells you put on production, but it also loses production days for all the wells that get delayed that are going to be POP'd to the future, particularly in later next year -- in the next year. But the point is, we're now dealing with that and I think we have that squared away. I have a later slide we'll talk about more detail on that.","As you all know, we're heavily focused on maintaining efficient operations. So although we would've had an opportunity a month or 2 ago to make the change, we decided not to. We decided not to accelerate activity to catch up with those at 30 POPs, especially in light of the current commodity price environment. We could've added a rig or 2 or perhaps a frac fleet to accomplish this. We could've gone back to single well pads instead of 3-well pads. All of these things would either chew up capital or they would be negatively impacting our capital efficiency. There aren't really many good high-quality rigs available. And even if we want to do that, we think going -- doing inefficient things made no sense. ","So with our strategy, you have to realize also that if we were to come out and increase rig count today, for instance, with our 3-well pads, it would have basically 0 impact on this year's production. So the decision was made that. We've chosen to basically not rev up the engine and chase the issue with additional capital and rigs, especially, as I said, with what's going on in the commodity world. And since those 30 POPs are moving into 2018, this results in a reduction on our capital this year by about $100 million.","Overall, I would say that decision is very consistent with our long term objective to grow production efficiently at high margins and high returns and therefore, improve corporate returns by maintaining a steady pace of activity which is, as you all know, a very important attribute of our longer term 10-year plan.","Now I'm going to turn to Slide 6. And on this slide we'll talk about the various topics, including the fact that we've been producing increased amounts of gas and NGLs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp field from horizontal producing wells. So it was proved, developed producing wells. They were on production at the end of 2016 have shown increases in gas and NGL production. Incidentally, they're right on track with their oil production. ","What's happened is we determined that the increases are due to higher GORs or gas oil ratios, than what we forecasted at the end of last year, so almost a year ago that were used in the plan. As you might guess, our engineers tend to forecast production conservatively, especially in areas where we don't have a lot of well history. And as a result, they used historical data for all those wells through the end of last year to establish a GOR average for the plan and these just proved to be too low compared to the actuals we're experiencing.","This is a positive thing when the smoke cleared, because the increased gas and NGL production, already this year, the first half of the year, has generated about $20 million of incremental revenue. And it will increase EURs on these wells. It'll increase BOEs, total production from wells. It will lead to deposit reserve revisions and better returns for that matter. So this is actually positive.","What's important -- the most important thing to note, though, is we're continuing to meet our type curves for the oil in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells. And already, 2017, new drills we drove this year are right on point and doing very well. In fact, some of it, as I said, are doing better than we expected as we get above 3.0 style completions.","For example, all the wells we've drilled this year, the oil content in those wells continue to average 70% to 80%, that's what you'd expect. That's what we've seen through time in the field. And in fact, the cumulative oil content for of all the wells that have been drilled since 2011, horizontal wells I'm speaking of, has been about 70%. So the oil is doing very, very well. It's just simply the fact we're increasing GOR which is expected. I've got a couple of slides to show you some history and some color on why that is an expected outcome.","So when we boil this down, oil is absolutely meeting our expectations on a per well basis and adding more gas and NGLs to the mix is a positive in terms of revenues and reserves without even affecting oil. So I think we have to look at that in that perspective. ","Turning to growth rates. The growth rate changes we're incorporating into the modeling here now are 100% related to the POP deferrals. And so they're not -- some -- actually, some of the increases in production related to GORs are offsetting the fact that we lost some POPs in the schedule. We now expect that the overall production growth rate will be closer to the bottom end of our range, about 15% to 16%, owing to slipping those POPs into 2018 and the delays in the schedule that came from that. ","Accordingly, the oil growth rate is reduced, too. It's just simply moving to oil. The oil is not gone here from the 30 POPs. It will come back when the wells are POP'd, probably, early 2018. So it's a situation where this is nothing other than a deferral. We still expect oil content for this year to increase from last year and average about 58%. That's reflecting some of the GOR data that we'll cover in a minute.","So really, despite the operational issues and the higher GORs we've encountered, there is no change to our 10-year growth target on oil. Oil maybe the same or higher as we get above 3.0+ style completions. It's also the fact that our gas and NGL growth will probably now be higher than our previous forecast. In other words, we'll be higher than 1 million BOE in 10 years as a result.","Let me talk a little bit about 2018 now and it has to do with a review of kind of what our plans might be. We obviously have a very strong balance sheet. We're building a strong derivatives position as I mentioned earlier when I -- at the start of the discussion. And we can manage through really any downturn or any price scenario and work towards living more within our cash flow and improved returns by doing so, especially as we drill these higher- return wells.","So our objective will be, really, to be flexible, adaptive as we address our budget for next year. As you know, in a $55 oil case which was the basis of that 10-year plan, our models always have shown and continue to show that 2018 would be a cash flow neutral year which is a major milestone we've been heavily focused on. And that case has, of course, adding 2 or 3 rigs.","In a band between $50 and $55, I think that level of activity continues to make sense, especially with our hedge structure is struck at about $50. However, I would say in a $45 case, our overspend will be pretty significant. So at the very least, we would probably rethink adding those new rigs. Obviously, at $40 and below, a further slowdown might be warranted or would likely be warranted in my view.","So our message is that we're going to show these scenarios to our board over the next few months and we will be very prudent in trying to more closely match our cash flow and capital and preserve our flexibility to deal with any price scenario that we're dealt. I would say to you, in any case though, 2018 is shaping up as a very strong year for the company. ","Now let's go on to Slide 7. This is a more granularity on POPs. This is more information than anything else. Our plan assumed 260 POPs, with 150 of those occurring in the second half of the year. So we actually did plan for some significant back-weighting in production in the first place. The graph on the slide is illustrative -- it shows the cumulative number of wells that we had planned to POP. That's in the blue bars for the year. And then as you see in the orange bars, those are the actual POPs anticipated.","We did fall behind 11 POPs during the first half. You can see that there was between 110 POPs and 99 and that was related to those unforeseen pressure-related issues that led to drilling delays. At first, you might think that falling short 11 POPs is not that big of a deal, it's not that significant. But when you couple that with the fact that many of the wells were POP'd later in the first half of the year than expected, the impact is really heavily magnified. You just lose production days is the concept. ","And just for perspective, 29 of the 99 wells that we completed in the first half of the year occurred in June. That's about 1\/3 of -- all of the first half POPs were in June. And half of the June wells were POP'd in the last 2 months -- 2 weeks of the month, so second half of June. As a consequence, you expect and it's true, July production looks very strong. But this is a timing thing related to when POPs are put on production.","Now we expect, because we said we're not going to choose to try to catch our tail here, we're going to do -- POP 131 wells in the second half of the year which will put us at 230 or 30 below the plan. And when you defer those and then you couple that with delays just due to pushing the POP schedule backwards, what you get is a significant loss in production days for the year. So the idea is if you delay a POP of a flush-producing well for 30 days, what happens is it ends up being a significant hit to the annual production for the well. So with so many wells delayed, the result is then compounded. So the oil is not gone, it's just produced later when the wells are actually POP'd.","So what you can see on this graph and the lines though are production plots. Using the same color scheme which is the plan in blue and the actual -- expected actual in sense of the future in orange. As you see, we lose about 8,000 barrels a day from the plan. That's 100% related to the reduction in oil growth. But that oil is coming, it's just not coming this year.","Now I'll turn to Slide 8. And let me just say, the next 2 slides are really educational and we're including these more for your information about GORs. So I'm not going to cover them in great detail. But I want to be clear about this. This GOR matter is simply about physics. And it's a well-documented phenomenon in the Permian Basin. And the cool thing about our data is we can show you history to that end. In particular, the first graph here on Slide 8, we show our planned horizontal and wet gas production for this year for all the wells we have in production at the end of that year.","So these are the PDP wells. They were on production by the end of last year. And I'll refer to those PDP wells because that's how they're -- these are classified in the reserve report in that way. These are proved developed producing wells that you're in. What we can show is how the actuals track on these wells compared to how they were forecasted in the plan. And in particular, what you can see is that the GOR increases that we've seen are higher than what we expected.","You can see that, actually, our GOR plan was higher than at the end of the year than it was for the first of the year, but it ended up -- results ended up being higher than we anticipated. So we produce more wet gas. Wet gas, as you know, is that which refers to the production stream when it comes out of the well. So it goes -- the way gas goes directly to gas processing and separated into dry gas and NGLs. So we just simply didn't get the GOR forecast right here, but it's a good thing as a point because all that amount above the dash line is incremental revenue.","And so what -- the more important aspect of this slide is the bottom line which is the green line. And it shows what our oil production has done compared to the plan for all those wells and they are right on the money is where expected to be. And so what we're seeing is even though gas and NGLs are above the plan, oil is on plan from all these wells and that's an important message for everybody to understand.","If you look at the -- just to reiterate, a reduction in production for this year on oil has nothing to do with GOR. It only has to do with the fact we had some delays in getting some new wells on production. And then, also the decision not to be inefficient in trying to catch up has nothing to do with GORs.","Slide 9, I like this slide a lot because it really has a history lesson embedded in it. It shows the long term history of how the GORs behaved through time. And you can see on the left-hand graph, evidence from a large number of wells that over 40 years, the GOR increases and stabilizes. You've seen -- this is from all the vertical drilling that we've done over those 4o years. But you hit about 4,000 cubic feet per barrel after about 10 years and then you ultimately reach an -- about 4,500 after 40 years. ","So what we're saying is, this is normal. It's normal for reservoirs that are driven by solution gas to experience this kind of GOR history and the history shows it in these graphs. What you also know is the increasing GORs on horizontal wells should be consistent with that because you're producing from the same field is what you expect.","What you see on the right-hand graph then is the GORs for the horizontal wells that we have drilled over the last 5 years. And what you can see, not surprisingly, the GOR goes up very similar to vertical. Now what we found is from a modeling standpoint, the GOR has increased somewhat faster than on vertical wells. And we believe that may just be due to the fact that the horizontal wells, especially when they're completed properly, contact more surface area rock. And therefore, what happens when they do that, they draw down the pressures on the wells faster and then you get the gas ratio going up.","But you can see, it's not immaterial -- it's not materially different compared to vertical wells. Because actually, what you should expect is this to come just a little bit faster because of how efficiently we're completing the wells. And that we modeled, of course, too low of a number for this in our 2017 plan which is what I've already addressed.","One other factor that comes into play here is we have become heavily focused on the Wolfcamp zones. That's deeper than the Spraberry zones. And accordingly, what happens is you tend to see higher GORs in general when you're drilling deeper wells because they have more pressure. So it's not unusual to see higher GORs from that perspective also. The whole message here, again, is we're not seeing any significant changes in oil declines even though GORs are rising.","We have some slides back -- in the back of the pack at 24 and 25 that show individual wells or groups of wells, some of our earliest producers, 2011 to 2013, actually there's 26 wells in that mix, it shows just what you'd expect from this history which is GORs go up through time. And by the same token, in all these wells, oil continues to meet their expectations. Every single well shows that. In fact, if you look at all those wells, the average cumulative content of oil from those wells has ranged from 72% to 80% through their lives, so this is right where we expect it to be.","So finally, again, when all the smoke clears, higher gas and NGL rates also mean higher BOE production and revenue and reserves. ","I'm going to turn now to Slide 10 and just talk about the impact to capital, where we mentioned we're reducing $100 million, that means we're just not chasing those last completions and\/or drilling more wells to solve the problem this year. We're reducing the capital by $100 million or so. That's reflected 100% in the drilling and completion capital for the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area, particularly net -- the total going down to $2.4 billion. ","We expect that capital to be funded by the operating cash flow estimate today if you use $47.50 for the rest of the year, about $1.9 billion and substantial cash on hand. The fact is that, remember, we've also received $345 million of proceeds from mostly Permian acreage and divestitures this year. ","And finally, on Slide 11, where we see the growth. As already mentioned, we expect growth to be more closer to the bottom end of our range because of these operational delays that we have suffered this year. And really, the important point, I think, there is had we not experienced those delays and then we met our timing on POPs as a result, oil growth would've been right in that forecasted range of 24% to 28%. ","In addition, if you think about it, because of what I mentioned on GOR, we would actually exceed the top end of our range of 15% to 18% if we include the benefit of the increased gas and the NGL volumes we got related to the higher GORs that we experienced. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, 2018 is shaping up as a very strong year for Pioneer.","So with that, I'm going to toss it over to Joey and he can give a little more operational details on what's going on in Permian.","Jerome Hall","Thanks, Tim. I'll be picking up on Slide 12 which shows early results for 9 of our Version 3.0+ wells in the Lower Spraberry Shale and then 2 Wolfcamp B areas.","The upper left graph illustrates performance of 3 Lower Spraberry Shale wells with 3,000 pounds per foot of proppant loading. Same story in the upper right, except it's for a group of Wolfcamp B wells. In the lower left, we're comparing the performance of 3 Wolfcamp B wells with higher water and proppant volumes at 67 barrels per foot and 2,500 pounds per foot. In all 3 instances, the new wells were outperforming offset wells with vintage 3.0 completions.","We're obviously very encouraged by these early results and we will be reporting on results of additional optimization tests over the next 2 quarters, including our 3 100 barrel per foot, 5,000 pound per foot wells which were just recently placed online. And in addition, we have successfully completed our fiber optic well stimulation and we'll be POP-ing our 3 wells that were stimulated along the full length using only sliding sleeves. ","Moving on to Slide 13. Here, we're showing the latest results of our Jo Mill wells. We POP'd 4 new wells in Q2. 3 of those wells are shown here compared to our previous 5 POPs. The fourth well is cleaning up and the 3 new wells that we POP'd during our southern acreage and the 2 remaining POPs remaining in 2017 both will be in the northern part of our acreage. We continue to be very encouraged with the results of the Jo Mill. ","Now moving on to Slide 14. Our drilling program continues to deliver strong returns. 3.0 completions remain the standard design. And as Tim mentioned, we'll consider program modifications as we evaluate the results of the 3.0+ completions. We have increased the expected EURs in the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, respectively. Well cost have also ticked up slightly to account for the modifications to our casing design in some areas, but we continue to forecast robust IRRs of 40% to 75% even at a lower commodity price of $50 oil and $3 gas. ","So wrapping up my Permian update on Slide 15. We finished the quarter with the expected 61 POPs and averaging 213,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which is 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% over Q1. The range of expected 2017 production growth has been revised to 30% to 32%. As Tim already mentioned, we're updating our full year POP forecast approximately 230 wells, with 55 to 60 of those wells in Q3. ","So with that, I'll turn it over to Ken Sheffield to talk about South Texas.","Kenneth Sheffield","Thank you, Joey and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 16. Pioneer resumed limited drilling and completion activity in our Eagle Ford asset in March. We plan to complete and POP 20 wells during the year, including 9 DUCs drilled more than a year ago and 11 new wells, where drilling operations were recently concluded. Design changes for the 2017 program include increased well spacing and longer laterals for the 11 new wells and tighter cluster spacing and much higher proppant concentrations for both the new wells and the DUCs. The cumulative effect of the design changes are expected to yield EURs averaging 1.3 million barrels equivalent, with IRRs ranging from 35% to 45% on the new wells. ","Four DUCs POP'd in the second quarter have been on production for about 50 days and are exhibiting greater than 20% improvement compared to offset wells with less intense completions. Two new wells were POP'd in the last few days of July and we look forward to seeing results for these 2 new wells in the balance of the program in the second half of the year. The program will also moderate production decline with fourth quarter 2017 production expected to be about 20% below that of fourth quarter 2016. ","I'll now turn it over to Rich Dealy to review marketing highlights and financial results.","Richard Dealy","Thanks, Ken. I'm going to start on Slide 17, where Frank talked about giving us an update on our takeaway capacity for oil. As you can see from this slide, we're currently transporting about 40% or 60,000 barrels per day of our own production to the Gulf Coast. Those volumes were being delivered to Corpus Christi, Houston and Nederland, 3 of the major refinery and export markets on the Gulf Coast. Of those barrels, we're exporting about 1 million barrels per quarter, as Tim talked about, with the rest being sold in the refinery market.","Longer term, we're targeting to move 70% to 80% of our planned oil production to the Gulf Coast market, where we have access to both storage and export facilities. Over the next few months, we plan to finalize a number of agreements that will allow us to ramp up those transport volumes in connection with our forecasted oil growth plans. Once those agreements are complete, I would expect to see our export volumes grow considerably above the 1 million barrels per quarter that we're doing today.","On the gas takeaway front, just to give you an update there. We have plenty of capacity through 2019. With that in mind, though, we're currently looking at a number of the new proposed newbuild pipelines that would come online in 2019 so that we can transport our gas, forecasted out in 2019 and beyond, to industrial users on the Gulf Coast, LNG facilities as well as export opportunities to Mexico. So we're working diligently on that.","On the NGL front, we do have adequate takeaway capacity through 2020, as well as in fractionation capacities, so we're in good shape there. And in terms of gas processing, just to give you an update there, we're working with our partners to make sure we have adequate processing capacity, in particular, target plans to start up the next new plant in the first quarter of 2018, with another plant expected in the third quarter of 2018. Thereafter, we typically expect to see a new plant every 12 months or so and somewhat dependent on what the size of those new plants are in the future. So I think suffice it to say that you can see that we're making good progress on having ample takeaway capacity and processing to accommodate our long term growth plan over the next 5 to 10 years.","Turning to Slide 18 and earnings update. We did report net income attributable to common stockholders of $233 million or $1.36 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative gains of $71 million or $0.42, that's really due to lower commodity prices at the end of June as compared to the end of March. We did have one unusual item for the quarter. It was a gain on the sale of our Martin County acreage that we've announced back in April. That was $124 million after tax or $0.73. So adjusting for those 2 items, as Tim mentioned, we're at $38 million of adjusted income or $0.21 per share. ","Looking at the bottom of the slide where we reflect guidance relative to results. You'll see there that what was in the guidance are on the positive side of guidance on all items. So overall, we had a very strong quarter financially.","Looking at Slide 19, you'll see that, as all of you are aware, commodity prices were down during the quarter. So we were down on realized prices 8% on oil to $45. We're down 13% on NGLs and 6% on gas. These price realizations do exclude our derivative benefits, so we did receive $24 million during the quarter for cash receipts from our hedging activity. You can see the impact of those at the bottom of the slide, the most meaningful being on oil, where we added about $1.59 per barrel from our hedging results. ","Turning to Slide 20. Looking at production costs. Production costs in total were flat, relatively flat quarter-on quarter when you look at those bars there. If you exclude production and ad valorem taxes, production cost were down 2% relative to the first quarter and down 9% relative to 2016. So we continue to make good progress on our production cost. The decline, as Tim mentioned, is primarily due to our increasing production from our lower-cost horizontal Wolfcamp wells and in the company's and the operations team's cost reduction efforts.","Turning to Slide 21. We continue to have an excellent balance sheet and great liquidity. As you can see with $300 million of net debt, this does reflect the $2.4 billion of cash that we have on the balance sheet. We have unsecured credit facility of $1.5 billion that was completely unused. That resulted in a net debt-to-book capitalization at the end of the quarter of 3%. So overall, great financial position.","If you look at our maturity schedule there, we do show our next bond maturity is in May of 2018, with the current plan to pay that off in May of next year with a cash on hand. You will notice if you look at the balance sheet that has been moved up to current based on that plan to pay that off next year.","Turning to Slide 22, looking at our guidance for the third quarter. Daily production guidance of 274,000 to 279,000 BOEs per day. The rest of these items are all consistent with prior quarters. I won't go through those is detail except for 2 items. DD&A, we did lower that guidance range, really, to reflect the addition of proved reserves from our successful drilling program. And then interest expense is down, reflecting the bonds we paid off in March of this year. And you'll see the next step-down in interest expense next year when we pay off the May of '18 bonds that come due. ","So with that, Yolanda, I think we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Tim, I wonder if I could just ask you a little bit more about this oil pressure issue? Is this a localized issue? Is it across the entire play? And what makes you comfortable that this won't recur, particularly if you continue with increasingly larger frac load as you go forward?","Timothy Dove","Well, first of all, the fact is we think the recurrence of this has been stymied by the fact we're using this 4-well casing -- 4-string casing design on the wells. I mean, what we were, of course, experiencing is trying to use 3-string casing was a noble effort, but when you have subtle worsening of the pressure issue, then basically, we find ourselves having too many high-cost wells and delays as a result. So we took the remedial action of putting the 4-string casing design in play -- in place. And it in and of itself has solved the most material parts of any issue we're going to have going forward. Now it comes with days and it comes with a little bit more cost, but I think that solution's in place.","One way we will be able to help solve our own issues are related to the fact that we're going to be utilizing a lot of our own produced water in drilling and so on. But in terms of where this occurs, there's various over- and under-pressure situations across the basin. In particular, where we're focus, we see it more in areas of Martin County and Midland County. Not every area, it just depends on where you are in the counties. And we typically don't see it as much where you don't have as many vertical wells drilled, in particular, the area -- what we call the SWAT or the Southern Wolfcamp JV area, we don't see this as much. So it happens principally though in the areas where we're doing quite a bit of drilling. And so since we're a concentrated driller over adjacent leasehold, that's definitely one of the issues that we have then forced ourselves into is basically going to 4-string casing.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. So you would characterize the issue as solved now? Or is there a risk of this becomes an ongoing issue, as I say, as you continue to test bigger plays.","Timothy Dove","This one's solved.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. My follow-up, if I may, is really on the '18 commentary around guidance. I guess, you haven't really given guidance. But when you see the POPs moving to '18, is that additive to the '18 plan? I guess there's a couple of parts to this question, so that's kind of part 1. And part 2 would be, well, if your type curve is so much better -- I mean, when I spoke to Frank last night, he said it's a little better. It looks like they're exponentially better. So at what point do you look at the activity level relative to the higher well results especially it now becomes a standard well? And what then would that do to the activity level and the production outlook for '18? I'm just trying to figure out if we've lost this production from those 30 POPs or if we get it back in '18? And I'll leave it there.","Timothy Dove","Yes, the question is how many total POPs we're going to complete next year, right, because it depends on how many wells we're going to run, how many frac fleets. Those have not been determined. I think it would be probably a minimum or the same type of number we planned on this year, 250 to 260. What you count in those is -- you have to decide, are you counting to 30 in those or you're going to take 30 off the back, you're going to build it to 270, 280. Those are still all on the planning phases right now. The way I would think about '18 guidance is though that we certainly will reflect an increase in what we expect from the wells to the extent of these 3.0+ wells continue to show good results. That's exactly what we did. If you remember, in relation to moving from 2016 to 2017, we all of a sudden were using 3.0 style completions as the ticket to our planning in 2017 and that's proving to be accurate.","So I think the real question is when do we have enough data on 3.0+ wells to make that statement. I mentioned in my comments that we're looking at potentially increasing the number of 3.0+ wells that we actually complete this year to try to get our arms around that problem. The early returns look very encouraging. And that would lead you to conclude if you can do more or less. In other words, we can produce that was much more oil and drill that many fewer wells that we're doing that well on a per well basis. But it gives us a lot of flexibility. The curves are pointing up into the right in terms of well results.","Douglas Leggate","So you see '18 would be a very strong year? What are you trying to guide us to?","Timothy Dove","I'm trying to guide you to say it's going to be a strong year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Dave Kistler with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler","Following up on Doug's question here, when we talk about catch up, it sounds like how you're answering that is really productivity of wells lead to the catch-up versus kind of the compound impact of the POP timing delays. It's not going to be catch-up driven by more spending, higher cost and, eventually, production catching up. I'm just trying to get clarification here.","Timothy Dove","Yes, I think if you realize -- I think everybody gets fixated in moving 30 POPs. That's really not the effect, is that significant in 2017. The bigger issue is delayed production of new wells. In other words, days on production because of moving the schedule back. I commented on that when I was speaking in my sort of prepared notes. But -- so it's really not -- the 30 POPs swing here is not in and of itself that significant, it's basically keeping on the POP schedule and producing the wells at a certain number of production days is what are your keys to meeting your target. I think more spending would come maybe more in the form of adding rigs, maybe adding rigs a month or 2 earlier or what have you, to help provide for a little bit more flexibility in the schedule. When you run a factory like we're, it's a pretty tight schedule. And if you have some drilling delays like we experienced and we had to go deal with them, then there's a need to sort of stop down the factory for a while and retool it and get back running. That's what we did with the 4-string casing.","David Kistler","Okay, I appreciate that. And maybe diving a little deeper. Obviously, stock's under pressure today. But when we think about the relative decline today versus what the relative decline might be in cash flows while you're trying to catch up, it seems like it's disproportionate to the stock performance. Can you kind of comment on what this means in terms of cash flow outlook? Obviously, we can't control exactly where commodity price goes and whatnot. But in a steady-state environment, is it fair to say that slippage in cash flow and production growth really isn't commensurate with what we're seeing in terms of stock performance?","Timothy Dove","I won't comment on the stock. I mean, it is what it is. But I comment on our internal goals which would have us -- you have -- is deferring some of these production and that's not a bad thing. It should -- it might be about a good thing if prices are higher by the time the wells come back on production. But that all said, I think the whole objective here is to get into a scenario which is still in our plan for 2018 if you were to have $55 case being basically such strong cash flow or meeting our capital needs on a neutral basis. That's still in the plan.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Tim, my first question is just thinking about the vertical development and your kind of core area in the Midland Basin. So my question is in areas where you're seeing more dense vertical development, are you seeing any negative variances in terms of the oil decline?","Timothy Dove","No.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. So you don't think that this increase in the GOR has to do with just the historical vertical development which has been relatively dense and where your core areas is? I just want to clarify that.","Timothy Dove","Let me reiterate it, A.J. The deal is, here, even though the GOR goes up, it does not affect the oil curve. The oil curve is right on target. What you're doing is you're increasing more gas and more NGLs. That's the end of story.","Arun Jayaram","Great, great. I did want to clarify that. My second question, as you do to move to a 4-string casing design, what does this do in terms of cycle times on the drilling side and spud-to-POP ratios as you get this issue resolved?","Timothy Dove","So, first of all, if you just look at the drilling, as I mentioned, it's about 3 to 5 days incremental time to set the additional string casing. And there's a certain -- relatively limited amount of cost associated with that. What that allows you to do is basically stay more on scheduled so that you can actually reduce your spud-to-POP timing. So what happens, of course, is if you have a relatively tight schedule which we try to run the factory efficiently and you have POPs that are delayed because of this issue, in other words, if the drilling is delayed a few days more than you thought, then what happens is the POPs are delayed and they also can get out of SKU because now you've got to move frac fleets at different locations. It just changes the cadence of the completions. And so what we'll do here by running a 4-string casing will be much more predictable about how long the wells are going to take.","You realize, if you're in a situation where you have a low-circulation zone or a big drilling problem, like we've been having if we were running 3-string casing, we could have 20 extra days on the wells as we go try to remediate the problem. Now we're saying, okay, we're going to stick on 3 to 5 days and we can be a lot tighter on the planning.","Operator","Our next question will come from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Let me just follow-up on that pressure issue. I mean, is there any color of what caused the changing pressure regimes in these shallower zones that led to the 4-string design change? I know you mentioned that it's new, but did you expect this to change or worsen than over time? And any color there?","Timothy Dove","Well, I think most of the cause of the pressure is, particularly high pressure issues, are in the shallow zones. These are typically zones where we're reinjecting produced water. And so to the extent we have a lot of operations going on or others do in the area, the pressure goes up in these zones. And in turns out they do naturally abate, the pressures naturally abate, so we can kind of -- in the future kind of control this pressure issue. But ultimately, what's happened to decades of introduction of produced water into these zones, they are higher pressure by definition, so they have to be dealt with. But right now, as I said, the 3-string -- 4-string casing design solves it basically because we just sort of wire around the problem.","Now there's the other things we can do, I think which is, as I said, we can reduce ejection in certain areas around where we're going to be drilling. But more importantly, you realize there's a real opportunity at the end of the tunnel here to basically start using produced water in fracs which we're doing more and more and more as opposed to using fresh water. So we're focusing on it now, is using produced water and brackish water and other non-potable water sources and that helps to solve the problem, too. So we have various different angles that we can approach this and avoid the issue. But the most -- the fastest remediation, just from an operational standpoint, was to get out there and put a 4-string casing design to work, is what we've done.","Evan Calio","Great. In the second question, on the 3.0 completions, the 3.0+ completions look encouraging. Any color you have of what are the infrastructure in place in '18 to handle a full year 3.0+ completions that require additional built-out? Or maybe just color when you'd be in the position if that were to become your base completion or the discussion of limiting factors? I'll leave it there.","Timothy Dove","Sure. So as you know, this year, we're spending quite a bit of money on our capital water-related projects. And I think it's also true that we'll do the same next year. This year, I think we're spending $160 million on our water projects. Sort of early penciling in at $150 million a year for next year. The idea this year, in particular, was to build the mainline construction up from the south to the north to connect the entire field. That's a huge game changer to be able to swing water. In addition to which, we're adding more subsystems and more frac ponds and so on as we build out the system. The answer is yes. I mean, we're factoring in the possibility that we would go 3.0+ which is we've got to get a better name than that, I realize. But 3.0+, we got to change -- if we change to that in a considerable fashion, you've got to up the water ante. But I think we can do that, no problem.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Maybe to start out, one follow-up question on the GORs. I mean, it seems like -- I guess the asymptote that you're -- that it looks like you'll be approaching in terms of the long term GOR of the wells, is it the same as you thought it was and you're just getting more gas faster because of a slightly quicker pressure depletion over the life of the well? Is the eventual pressure depletion over the life of the well consistent with what you thought it would be? And then maybe I guess from a longer term point of view, is the extra gas -- will this require any extra gas processing capacity or drive any surface constraints over the -- kind of the medium term part of your plan?","Timothy Dove","That's a great question. So I think if you look at the graph that was on Slide 9, the one in particular on the right, what you see is that the GORs for horizontal are also approaching sort of the 4.5 mark or so. I don't have the straight edge in front of me, but it's about that which is similar to the vertical. I don't know whether it'll end up at 5 or 4.5 or what, but it looks like it's sort of reaching a similar sort of number. We don't know the exact final number, but it shouldn't be materially different than the vertical wells, but we shall see. The main message for the call today is that we didn't really expect the GORs to go up as fast. It didn't -- they didn't go up as fast in the vertical wells, but that's easily explained by the fact we're touching more rock, we're drilling higher pressure wells and we reached bubble point a lot faster on these wells and therefore, the gas comes at you.","So we just didn't have that factored in from an engineering standpoint because we didn't have any data to tell us that until this -- principally this year. And so that's why we sort of missed on the GOR forecast. But let's reiterate, this is a good thing. Getting more gas and NGL out of these wells is a very good thing. It's extra economics and extra reserves. That said, I think you're on point that we will now, as we have in the past, be focused on making sure we have of enough gas processing facilities to deal with the incremental gas. Toward that end, Targa going to be planning a new gas plant coming in first quarter next year and one in the third quarter next year to address these exact questions. In the meantime, I think we're okay on gas processing space. But I think we'll have to look at that as we go forward because we may actually -- even though we've been using 200 million cubic feet a day incremental plants, we may want to increase that size. But this certainly bodes for the Permian Basin producing a lot more gas without a doubt.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And then maybe -- that was a very helpful. And then maybe one on the Eagle Ford. Can you talk a little bit -- I mean, you talked about the program that you're going to be drilling over the rest of this year. Can you talk about your plans for the Eagle Ford going forward? And what impact the current drilling efforts could have on its eventual position within the portfolio?","Timothy Dove","Well, certainly, one of the objectives here is to find out how productive these wells can be. And here, I mean utilizing a more standard or let me just say close to 3.0 style Permian Basin frac design and longer laterals like we do in the Permian Basin and wider-spaced wells. As you recall, we got probably 2 closely down-spaced the last campaign. That's a critical thing to be testing. You realize we're only doing a limited number of wells. But nonetheless, it should give us the data to decide what are the relative economics of the Eagle Ford going to be going forward versus our other investment opportunities. Eagle Ford has a bit of a challenge because you're speaking of gas oil ratios, I mean, it only produces 1\/3 oil. So it is behind the eight ball a bit when it comes to commodity prices. But that's something we have to decide when we get to that point. The main thing we want to do is get the technical data out to support that we can actually drill highly economic wells and then we'll decide where to go from there.","Operator","And moving to our next question, we'll hear from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","If we could go back -- I know you've already spent some time, Tim, on the Slide 7, but if we can go back and talk about that a little bit more because I really feel like it's the crux of what's happening in this quarter. And I'm wondering if you could help guide interpretation here. There's at least 2 interpretations I can't think of or have heard this morning. One is that if you look at the months of April, May and June, that, on average, you were 15 wells behind your plan. And so if you think production from 15 new wells was flushed production, that, honestly, more than fills the shortfalls versus the oil...","Timothy Dove","Exactly. You can actually do the math precisely like you're doing it. And what you're getting to is the same point I mentioned early, Charles which -- earlier which is the notion that you -- all of those times that you're behind in the schedule -- remember we're you're showing detail by month, of course, all that time you're behind you're losing production days for all the wells that were pushed back. And so, by definition, production days equals production. That's what you see at the top curve. We could've shown you a graph of production days too, we lost, but it becomes esoteric at that point. We just decided to show you production. But you're exactly on the right point.","Charles Meade","Got it. So one of the alternative interpretations here, though, is that if you look at where you were in March, you're 6 wells behind. And where you are in June, you're just 11 wells behind. And so in that interpretation, you just met 5 wells which doesn't really fill the gap. But I think if I understand you, Tim, the difference is when those wells came on and the catch-up late in the quarter. Is that right?","Timothy Dove","Right. Yes, you can look at the -- if you look at the orange bars, you can see -- the nuanced way to look at this is, in April, we completed 9 wells and then 23, then 29. So not only was it back-weighted in the quarter, but most of the June wells were in the last half of that month. In fact, what do we say, half the wells in the quarter were backed up into that month. So it's -- again, it's exactly the same concept that you -- when all -- that orange bar is below the blue when you're losing production days and that's all it is.","Charles Meade","Got it.","Frank Hopkins","Charles, this is Frank. If you want to call me later, I'll take you through all the actual numbers of what was in the budget and what's actually -- what we had for 6 months forecast in that.","Timothy Dove","We can give you details, Charles, on production days.","Frank Hopkins","We'll give you more detail than you want, yes.","Timothy Dove","It's get pretty weird when you're talking production days.","Charles Meade","Well, I might be weird enough to understand it. But let me ask one other question. Tim, I like those graphs you put in about the trends in the gas-oil ratio and about how you're getting there quicker with horizontal wells. I'm curious, I imagine you've probably looked at that trends and broke it down by the version of completion and that you -- I imagine, you'd be getting there quicker with the Version 3.0 than you did with Version 1.0, hitting that whether it's 4,500 or 5,000 GOR ratio. Is there -- is that on the right track? And is there anything you can share on that front?","Timothy Dove","Sure. I think what you would say, first of all, is the deeper the well, the higher pressures the wells is and, by definition, the higher it is that the volumes come at you including gas. And it's typically the case, you reach bubble point faster in those wells also. Realizing, on these wells, we've reached the bubble point in 2 or 3 months after they're first put on production. So the idea that you should see some radical change in production when to hit bubble point just doesn't make any sense. We hit bubble point down there instantaneously from the center point of the history of the well.","And so, really, what you see is, here, the faster the GOR goes up, it's more related to depth. It's also related to which zone and where you're producing, it's not the same across the entire field. So our modeling will need to entail, as you kind of alluded to, what's going to be the GOR by well, what -- is it going to be by zone, by what location and so on. We're going to micrometer the thing a little bit more to get very, very accurate for 2018. This is where we made the error in 2017, we just used kind of the -- any current data as of the end of '16.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Just a follow-up on the Slide 7. The issues that spawned the delays and the need for the extra layer of casing began in February, you're already about 14 wells behind at the end of April. As we look forward, are there any other risk to the upside or downside to production guidance for the rest of the year? It could be in a similarly early stage now that may be worth highlighting.","Timothy Dove","I'm familiar with the upside case for sure which is to do it -- if we end up going through more 3.0+ wells, we could see incremental production coming out of that pretty clearly. I don't have anything to report for you regarding anything on the downside.","Brian Singer","Great. And then also a timing question. There's usually a lag time between when wells are drilled and when they're POP'd. As we try to disaggregate the POP and impact of GOR on gas production, but neutral on oil production, in the second quarter in the Permian Basin versus the timing of wells, was there a material impact from the delayed POPs on second quarter oil production? And if not, why didn't we see a greater move up in oil production during the quarter?","Timothy Dove","That's exactly correct. We were still experiencing delays really in the May and slightly into June before we really tackled the 4-string casing design. And then you see that in the POP schedule really accelerating in the second half of June. It's exactly the same point that Charles was referencing which is we lost production days compared to that plant. So you can see that, for example, in the slide you're referencing, Slide 7, we were 20 POPs behind in May. We caught some back up in June, but they're all in the end of June. So guess what happens? You lose the production from those wells that was counted on for June. It just is what it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Just one from me. When you look at the extra cost in days on the casing design change combined with the fact that given the better GOR expansion, you're able to increase the EURs on the Wolfcamp zones. Does it sort of change the way to think about maybe the mix of Wolfcamp\/Spraberry wells going forward, like in the long term plan?","Timothy Dove","Well, I think everything we do is based on economics. Everything is based on returns on the wells. So theoretically, in a lot of the shallower zones, we don't have this issue that's as substantial, that is the pressure-related issues. And -- but the point is -- I'm talking about the pressure issues and since you're on the south also, you can have less issues in the south. But the point is I think we just look at the economics every day we drill a well and decide what's the implications of the well cost increase for the new design, what are the implications of the amount of returns as they increase with more -- higher GOR and, therefore, more gas and NGLs. And so, therefore, yes, we'll be evaluating that. But we've got excellent economics across this field, John, as you know.","John Freeman","No, I guess, I was just trying to look at it as, at the end of the day, the GOR expansion is a good thing like you said. So if the Wolfcamp B has gone from 1.5 to 1.7, A from 1.2 to 1.3, then it seems like that would maybe cause a little bit of a push towards more Wolfcamp. But...","Timothy Dove","As you know, we love the Wolfcamp B. It's been the predominant of the wells we drilled in there. But it just so happens now we're coming back and drilling the Wolfcamp As underneath -- above the Bs, I should say and that program has been very successful. So I think we just kind of continue with that kind of a program. Yes, I don't know if Rich mentioned this, but it's true. That also allows us -- when we go from the Bs and then go after the As above them to utilize existing facilities. So our facilities' capital needs are less that way.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","So specifically on the drilling pressures you all have seen, I'll just kind of throw it all into one question. Can you specifically talk about the particular zone that is, will be the first part? And then is there an option to look at other deeper zones to utilize instead of that? And then the third part of the question is if you did do more water recycling, what is the cost associated with that in your view?","Timothy Dove","Yes, thanks for the question, Scott. First of all, the formation in question where most of the injections have been done for decades is the San Andres formation, it's about 3,000 or 4,000-foot deep. As to alternatives that are deeper, we actually are heavily investigating those right now. Some of the deep zones have decent potential. We're probably cutting edge right now from the standpoint of understanding from a geological standpoint what it is that those zones could take as to produce water. We're actively studying that and have a team of geologists working on that. I don't know of anybody else in the an industry that's got the team we have working on that. And so we'll get that unlocked.","The question is going to be can you drill those wells and have them be economic versus your alternatives? And that's going to be your question, because they're going to be deeper wells. The third is recycling. Now recycling is not a material cost item for us. We just take produced water, slightly clean it up and reuse in fracs. So there's not a big cost in that other that it's already embodied in the capital of the water system because this will eventually be incorporated into and a part of our water supply system. So you can count the capital as already contributing towards the solution.","Scott Hanold","Okay. So you are, as you build up the water infrastructure, that recycling's part of it. So in theory, from a bigger picture perspective, it should mitigate itself naturally. Is that how I'm hearing it?","Timothy Dove","Well, it will for us. I mean, we're the ones who have the big water system. I don't know if that's true across the board. But certainly for us, that's the case.","Jerome Hall","Yes, Scott, this is Joey. I think you're hitting on a key point, that our water infrastructure is a critical piece in allowing us to -- and it's really I would call it reuse more than recycled because the amount of effort that we have to put into reusing the produced water is pretty minimal. And then you add to the fact that we have the Odessa water that we can blend it with and all of our Santa Rosa and the massive infrastructure that we have, we're able to manage this. It's just a matter of reaching the critical mass to where you have the timing issues worked out. Because where you produce it and where you need it, as you drill more wells, it becomes easier to manage. And that's why you'll see us here in the near term and the near future continuing to use more produced water. And it's something we've been doing that for a while and we continue to move that up. So it's a pretty easy issue to manage.","Scott Hanold","Yes, is there a time frame which you guys think that the infrastructure could be well in place? Is it over the next couple of years? And it is an option just to shut down some of the vertical wells that may be causing most of the issue because we they, honestly, probably don't produce as much as some of these horizontals do on a hydrocarbon basis?","Timothy Dove","Yes, I think the way you have look at vertical wells is a lot of these wells are very low producers now, as I showed the curve, 40 years into their lives, so they don't produce much liquid of any form. We wish they'd produce more oil, but they don't produce much volume of anything. So that's really not an issue. I mean, they wouldn't have any real contribution to shut in a significant number of vertical wells. But the bigger picture -- answer to your question is, yes, the next -- I'd say between now and the end of next year, we will have a full, ready to rock 'n roll produced water reuse system in place in the field. And we start to then mitigate the issue.","Scott Hanold","Yes, Tim. So just to clarify. I guess my question on vertical wells is why not shut them in and so they don't produce the water creating more capacity to inject into San Andres?","Timothy Dove","What I'm telling you is the vertical wells, on average, don't produce much water anymore because they don't produce much of anything. So they're -- I mean, you have these 5, 10 barrel a day wells of which 80 -- you're going to have similar amount of water on a system basically. So the point is that's not going to solve the problem. The bigger issue is as we drill horizontal wells, we're injecting much higher volumes of water and that's probably more a contributor than anything to do with vertical.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Tim, when you see what acreage price are going for around your area, what are you guys thinking about? And kind of given what your NAV looks like, I think, very underappreciated. Just maybe talk about M&A potential more on the sales side.","Timothy Dove","Well, the sales side. Well, I think the way I would couch that is one important note to make is we mostly have Tier 1 acreage, okay? That's important. So we don't have a lot of slacky acreage sitting around here that we would say automatically, \"This needs to be peeled off because it's substandard.\" That said, we're doing, as you know and we've talked about a quite a bit, quite a large number of trade still to block up our ability to drill long laterals. And so that continues. We have deals going all the time there and those are extremely valuable deals where no cash assets between the hands, but nonetheless, the size of the pie increase for both parties, with both parties in that trade end up having longer laterals they can drill. So as I said, the pie gets bigger. But if you look at some of the most recent acreage transactions, let's start with the 5 handle, all of our acreage is basically, with the exception of what we acquired from Devon, has basically 0 handle on the basis. So it wouldn't make any sense for us to do that.","Operator","That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy Dove","Thanks, everybody, by being on the call. We appreciate your time. Like I said earlier, I hope you enjoy the rest of this summer. We will look forward to seeing you when the season begins early September. And look forward to more conversations on these points. Thanks very much.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. Thank you all once again for your participation."],"17408":["Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call May  4, 2017 10:00 PM ET","Executives","Frank Hopkins \u2013 Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Tim Dove \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","Chris Cheatwood \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer","Joey Hall \u2013 Executive Vice President-Permian Operations","Ken Sheffield \u2013 Executive Vice President-South Texas operations","Rich Dealy \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Arun Jayaram \u2013 JPMorgan","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Michael Hall \u2013 Heikkinen Energy Advisors","John Freeman \u2013 Raymond James","Neal Dingmann \u2013 SunTrust","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Phillip Jungwirth \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Scott Hanold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Welcome to Pioneer Natural Resources First Quarter Conference Call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Thanks, Kyle. Good day, everyone, and again, as every quarter, thanks for joining us. I want to briefly review the agenda for today\u2019s call. Tim is going to be the first speaker. He\u2019ll provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2017 and give you an update on our plans for the rest of 2017.","As Tim commented in our earnings press release, Pioneer delivered another great quarter. We had solid earnings, strong production, continuing impressive horizontal well performance and reduced production cost. After Tim concludes his remarks, Chris will briefly discuss how Pioneer is taking advantage of leading-edge technologies and how innovation is expected to improve productivity as we progress towards our 10-year vision.","Joey will be up next, and he\u2019ll review our strong horizontal well performance in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. He\u2019ll also provide an update on drilling plans for the remainder of the year in his area and a progress report on the buildout of Pioneer\u2019s water distribution system.","Ken will provide an update on the limited drilling program we have underway and the Eagle Ford Shale this year. And last, Rich will summarize the first quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the second quarter. And after all that, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions.","And with that, Tim, I\u2019ll turn the call over to you.","Tim Dove","Thanks, Frank. And once again, welcome to our first quarter conference call. The first quarter, as Frank mentioned, was a strong start to the year, and the company is doing exceptionally well, both in terms of production this quarter as well as the fact that prices were up while we\u2019ve been able to stabilize cost and, actually, have lowered cost in some areas. I will talk about that in a few slides.","As Frank also mentioned, we\u2019re excited to have a couple of interesting new topics for you. One is the granularity surrounding our technology and innovation initiatives as well as our water sourcing strategy.","In the quarter, we reported adjusted income of $42 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Production came in above the top end of our range at about 249,000 BOE per day. That was a 7% increase or about 3% from last quarter. And importantly, we continue to show the ability to grow even since the downturn commenced and we expect that to continue.","The growth for the quarter, of course, was driven by the results from our continuing Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling campaign, and Permian production increased 7% quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, our new wells continue to perform really well. Permian oil production met our expectations for the quarter even though we only popped 38 wells instead of the 45-or-so that we had planned on, which indicates that well performance continues to exceed our expectations on the oil side, especially based on the Version 3.0 completions. We\u2019ll talk more about that in a few slides. The shortfall in POPs is really only a timing issue and we\u2019ll see that sorted out as some of it slipped into April.","Also, on the gas and NGL front, our gas and NGL production exceeded our expectations in a very material way. And to a great extent, we have Targa, our operator of our gas plant systems, to thank for that. They did a great job in terms of increasing NGL yields in response to higher pricing during the quarter, especially during January and February. In addition, by bringing on a plant that had been mothballed and also looping some pipelines and adding several new field compressors, we saw a reduction in line pressure in various areas of the field by about 2 psi.","And that may not seem like a lot, but that represents about a 5% reduction in pressure in the system in certain areas of the field, which allows more gas to flow into the system. So even though this increased percentage of gas and NGLs produced was a significant number, it\u2019s a good thing because it represented about $4 million of additional cash flow that was generated in the quarter than we had expected.","Our costs, as I mentioned earlier, were in line, and in a couple of cases lower, particularly on operating cost. Our electricity costs were down 4% or 5%. But really, more importantly is we saw a reduction to $6.31 per BOE from $6.42 at the prior quarter. We continue to benefit from the fact that our Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells are very attractively produced at about $2.33 per BOE. That excludes production taxes. So the more of those we drill and contribute to the mix, we can keep our production cost going down.","And we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire industry sector, and we did repay a debt maturity in March from cash on hand, that\u2019s reflected in our current cash balances. We were upgraded by all 3 rating agencies this quarter and we\u2019re extremely pleased about that. Debt levels, of course, remain exceptionally low.","Turning now to Page 5, and as previously announced, we were able to close a couple of sales regarding some Permian acreage, in particular, Upton, Andrews and Martin County for a grand total, considering one that closed in April of about $330 million. And we have, as we had telegraphed earlier, moved to 18 rigs in the first quarter in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp trend area.","I mentioned a minute ago, but we did place a relatively low number of POPs on the schedule this first quarter. Only 38 wells were put on production. That had to do mostly with the rig timing from when those rigs were put on late 2016 and into early this year. That should be expected to obviously change, going forward, where we would expect 60 or 65 POPs in the second quarter and even larger numbers in the third and fourth.","In other words, our production, as a result of our POPs schedules, is back weighted for the year, and in fact, it will be back weighted for the second quarter as well. What is important to say is Version 3.0 is now our default completion.","Joey will talk about the impacts of Version 3.0 optimization, but you\u2019ll see that the 3.0 wells continue to well exceed Version 2.0 wells. And we\u2019ve got a couple of slides in here regarding new zones, but in particular, the Jo Mill section, we\u2019re now going to show you several wells that have been drilled over the last couple of years to show how we think the Jo Mill can contribute in significant way.","It is emblematic with our efforts to build more data on these new zones. We\u2019re becoming a big exporter, I would say. We exported 1 million of Permian oil to Asia and Latin America during the first quarter. We have another 1 million barrels scheduled to ship out to Europe, actually to Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean during the second quarter.","So as we look forward, as we continue to grow oil production, the export market is going to become a bigger and bigger part of our marketing focus moving forward. Now turning to Slide 5, the 2017 update. Of those 18 rigs that was working and working in the North with a balance in the South, we will be testing some new completions, although as I said, 3.0 is our default. But there\u2019s about 15 wells that we\u2019ll be testing.","For example, sand volumes from 2,500 pounds per foot up to 3,000 pounds per foot. And even in one particular case, a 3-well pad on shorter laterals with 5,000 pounds per foot. So we\u2019re not ready to rename something in excess of 3.0 as a new version yet. That certainly would be interesting to see those wells as they come on production as we get into the second and third quarters.","We are maintaining our forecast for our growth at the Spraberry, Wolfcamp. It\u2019s expected to grow 30% to 34% compared to last year, and oil production still maintained at 33% to 37% growth. Ken Sheffield is going to come on in a minute and talk about what\u2019s happening in the Eagle Ford, but suffice it to say, we are now operating with 2 rigs. We have one outside completions fleet that\u2019s now working on our drilled but uncompleted wells in the Eagle Ford. And the total wells to be drilled this year remains at 11 new drills and 9 completions of formerly uncompleted wells. And what we\u2019re really trying to do here is use Permian-style completions, higher-intensity completions, to see if we can improve the well results at a wider spacing.","We were successful during the quarter of moving our gas processing operations away from what had been a difficult plan to operate after all these years at our Fain processing facility through a third party and are now of taking most of the gas from that facility. And what it should help us, of course, is to reduce our NPT, our nonproductive time issues, that we\u2019ve been dealing with now for several months. We believe that we\u2019re still on this range. We remain in the range of about 15% to 18% production growth, oil being up 24% to 28% this year. And what\u2019s really important, of course, is that our returns are holding up and we\u2019re still looking at 50% to 100% returns with allocated facility cost included for our D&C program for this year.","Now turn to Slide 6 and just continuing the update. Of course, there are a lot of moving parts when you\u2019re using corporate percentages, but the main message from our standpoint is that our oil forecast remains intact and on the numbers that were expected. We\u2019re going to reduce the forecasted oil content from 62% to 60% though service related to the third bullet point, which is to say we expect the same things we saw in the first quarter, which is the benefits of Targa\u2019s work to reduce line pressures and so on, to increase our gas production and NGL recoveries in the Permian Basin. Again, that\u2019s a good thing.","We\u2019ve got a couple of other adjustments that\u2019s going to change the overall corporate percentages. One is the fact that we did sell the Martin County acreage I mentioned earlier, which was very highly oily area. So we lost about 1,500 barrels a day of 80% oil. And then, related to the transferring of the gas processing operations, there was 1,000 barrels a day or so of light condensate, we call it drip condensate in the field -- actually, in the plant operations that had been sold as part of the condensate stream separately that will now be going down the pipeline and processed as NGLs as we have to reclassify what had been considered oil in the mix now to NGL. And that, of course, changes the corporate percentages as well. The fundamental is, though, there\u2019s really nothing changing the underlying our oil production, our oil forecasting, we\u2019re just fortunate we\u2019re able to actually get increased revenues at the gas and NGLs as we move forward.","We\u2019re going to remain with a capital budget of $2.8 billion. That\u2019s the same number we\u2019ve had all year. That\u2019s $2.5 billion for D&C and $275 million for vertical integration investments. We still see some cost inflation. In some areas, it\u2019s up to 10% to 15%. We see other areas that are single digits. We\u2019re assuming about a 5% net cost inflation to our operations, but I think I\u2019m pretty confident at this point to say that what we\u2019re doing in terms of both vertical integration and improvements in productivity will offset that 5%.","So I don\u2019t expect to be impacted by any significant amount of inflation in 2017 at the bottom line. That will be easily funded by the current estimates based on prices of about $2.3 billion of cash flow and the additional cash on hand.","We did, of course, finish our 2017 hedging program just this last quarter, where we now have both oil and gas hedged at about 85% of production. We did begin to build a 2018 oil book. We\u2019re actually a little over 20% of forecasted oil production now and 15% of gas production for next year. And we\u2019ll potentially look to add more hedges around or perhaps after the May 25th OPEC meeting.","Our efforts to sell approximately 10,000 acres in the Eagle Ford Shale continue. Those negotiations are ongoing, and we\u2019ll have more to say about that when those negotiations come to fruition. But ultimately, our measures continues the same. We\u2019re going to be drilling a high-return program, and it\u2019s that which allows us to say 2018 still appears to be the year when we spend within cash flow, and then 2019 and thereon are years that we will have cash flow exceeding our capital needs in order to grow 15% plus, going forward.","Turning to Slide 7. This slide has not changed. As you might guess. It\u2019s been from our earlier comments. Our first quarter spending in terms of cost to drill was $524 million. That would appear to be, of course, low, but it\u2019s indicative of the fact that we didn\u2019t have as many POPs in the first quarter, and it is, therefore, also indicative of a back-end-loaded POP schedule for the year, and we\u2019ll catch up \u2013 we still believe we\u2019ll be right on that budget for the entire year, funded, as I mentioned earlier, from cash flow and cash on hand.","And then turning to Slide 8, my last slide. We still are in beautiful position. I feel like to perform well vis-\u00e0-vis our vision to grow 15% plus for many years and reached that one million BOE per day target in 10 years or so. This year, of course, we\u2019re maintaining 15% to 18% growth, and that incorporates 24% to 28% oil growth. Again, the second quarter numbers are shown here. You might expect them to be higher in a scenario where you just calculate up the impact of certain number of POPs in the second quarter compared to the first. But the fact is just the way the rig schedule works, the vast majority of those POPs are in May and June, so we don\u2019t get as much of an effect as you might expect from the actual number of POPs. We\u2019ll see a bigger effect in the third quarter.","So I\u2019m going to stop there, and I\u2019m going to pass it over to Chris Cheatwood. Many of you know Chris as our EVP of Geosciences and Business Development. But most recently, he\u2019s been named Pioneer\u2019s Chief Technology Officer, and he\u2019s going to give you just a quick summary of some of the things we\u2019re doing in our technology and innovation initiatives.","Chris Cheatwood","Thanks, Tim. Let\u2019s go to Slide 9. Most of you guys know that our company has used leading-edge technology for many years. A number of them are listed on this slide, but for the sake of time, I\u2019m only going to discuss a couple of them. Also, my focus is going to be on the Permian, but the same is true for South Texas.","We geosteered over 1,600 wells in multiple areas over the last 10 years. In the Permian, we\u2019ve used 5,500 square miles of 3-D seismic in the Midland Basin combined with extensive core. Our proprietary petrophysical model is based on over 1,600 wells, and those have allowed us to build rock property volumes covering our multiple reservoirs. The graphic at the top right is a great display of the information we used to target when we steer our wealth.","With operations covering over 5,000 square miles in the Midland Basin, we must monitor and operate from centralized control rooms. We have replaced our legacy SCADA systems, with a single web-based platform to allow us to automate the edge via IoT technology. Mobility is also integral to this new system. Our most advanced example is our fully automated water distribution system that will be discussed later.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and get a glimpse of the future. The bullets on the left highlight some of our technology initiatives to change the way we work on our journey to million in 10. As on the previous slide, I\u2019m only going to elaborate on several examples. We are using the supercomputers and the GEOS software at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to model and visualize in 4-D the propagation of fractures when we stimulate the shale reservoir. the shale reservoir. Combining our real-world data with Livermore\u2019s computing power and cutting-edge code will lead us to a state-of-the-art solution for reservoir development.","Pioneer Pumping Services fluid ends were only lasting around 300 hours before failing due to metal fatigue. Working with Oak Ridge National Labs, we\u2019ve produced a proprietary fluid end with improved metallurgy in forging to increase the service life tenfold. The first one is in the field and it has passed 750 hours so far. i. Expects to scale production in the very future.","We are building a new physics-based drilling system comprised of three components being developed jointly with third parties. First, the dynamic drill string modeling software; second, a proprietary downhole tool to gather and transmit high-frequency data; and three, a real-time prescriptive analytics platform. This will be the ultimate continuous improvement drilling system when completed.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Joey Hall to talk about Permian operations.","Joey Hall","Thanks, Chris. I\u2019ll now be picking it up on Slide 11, where Version 3.0 completions continue to show impressive profile over 2.0 with 16 new POPs in Wolfcamp B and 12 new POPs in Wolfcamp A. This is our first time to show the improved performance of 3.0 wells in the Lower Spraberry Shale, where we have 17 version 3.0 wells, 10 of which came on in the first quarter. We expect our Version 3.0 wells to pay out the incremental cost of $500,000 to $1 million in less than one year. Looking forward, we have several larger completions planned for the rest of the year, as Tim had mentioned, testing sand concentrations between 2,500 and 5,000 pounds per foot and water concentrations up to 100 barrels per foot. We also plan to continue testing variations of cluster spacing and stage lengths.","Now going to Slide 12. Here, we are showing the encouraging performance of five Jo Mill wells that have POPs since Q4 of 2014. As you can see from the map, these wells are spread throughout our acreage and they are also a mixture of 1.0 and 2.0 completions. Average EURs are 900,000 BOEs for 6,800-foot laterals, and going forward, we have six Jo Mill wells planned for 2017, where we will be testing longer laterals, spacing and variations in the completions.","Now moving to Slide 13. Really no changes here from our last report, still estimating 260 gross POPs for the year, same estimates for well cost, EURs and production costs and still forecasting robust IRRs of 50% to 100% for Version 3.0 completions of $55 oil and $3 gas.","Now moving on to Slide 14. Pioneer continues to work on meeting our long-term water needs. Our water demand has more than doubled from approximately 150,000 barrels per day in 2014 to 350,000 barrels per day expected in 2017. And with our current completion design, our needs could quadruple by 2026. We remain focused on lowering cost and reducing the use of freshwater by increasing our use of brackish, effluent and produced water. As Chris mentioned, we\u2019re also leveraging automation to ensure we are delivering water to our locations in the most efficient manner we possibly can.","Continuing the water story on Slide 15. Today, we spent approximately $300,000 \u2013 or $300 million through 2016 for partial completion of the 100-mile mainline, the Odessa effluent water tie-in and a network of subsystems, ponds and water wells in our major drilling areas. We expect to spend $160 million in 2017, primarily for continuing construction of the mainline and additional subsystems and ponds. We\u2019ll also start the engineering for upgrades to the Midland wastewater treatment plant, where we will spend approximately $115 million from 2017 through 2020 to secure the supply of approximately 240,000 barrels per day of low-cost effluent water. We ultimately expect our investment in water infrastructure to reduce our cost by $500,000 per well.","Wrapping up my Permian update on Slide 16. We finished the strong quarter with 38 POPs and averaging 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is 13,000 BOEs per day or 7% over our Q4 2016. Our oil production was in line with expectations, while gas and NGL production was higher than expected due to lower line pressures across the field and improved NGL yields. Our expected 2017 production growth of 30% to 34% remains unchanged. We plan to POP 60 to 65 wells in Q2, primarily weighted toward the second half of the second quarter. This will leave 70 to 80 POPs in each of the remaining 2 quarters to close out 2017.","As I discussed last quarter, the variation of POP counts is caused by the cyclical nature of an 18-rig program and a few POPs from \u2013 sliding from March into April. Also keep in mind that we added 5 rigs in Q4 and 1 in Q1, and there\u2019s a 5-month cycle time before you start seeing the POPs.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ken Sheffield to talk about South Texas.","Ken Sheffield","Thank you, Joey, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 17. Pioneer\u2019s limited D&C program is underway in our Eagle Ford asset. We\u2019re currently operating 2 rigs to drill 11 new wells this year and we\u2019ve commenced completion operations for the 9 planned DUCs. We plan to complete and POP 20 wells during the year. 11 new wells will test design changes expected to significantly increase recovery. The design changes include wider spacing, 44% longer laterals, tighter cluster spacing and much higher POP concentrations, which have yielded strong results in both Eagle Ford and Permian operations. The cumulative effect of the design changes are expected to yield EURs, averaging 1.3 million barrels equivalent. Well results will be evaluated in the second half of 2017.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Rich Dealy to review the financial results.","Rich Dealy","Thanks, Ken, and good morning. I\u2019m going to start on Slide 18, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $42 million or $0.25 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative gains of $90 million after tax or $0.53 per share. That\u2019s really a result of lower oil prices at the end of March on a futures basis, relative to what they were end of December.","Also during the quarter, we had 2 unusual items that netted to a charge of $174 million, or $1.03 per share, mainly \u2013 main component of that was an impairment charge that was noncash related to Raton, really due to the decline of long-term gas prices is really what triggered debt impairment. So adjusting for those items, we\u2019re at $42 million of earnings or $0.25 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, where you can see how we did relative to guidance, you can see that as Tim mentioned, we\u2019re above our production guidance of 249,000 BOEs a day for the quarter. All the other items are either on the positive side or within guidance, other than exploration abandonment and we\u2019re slightly above guidance there mainly due to 1 well that we had some mechanical problems on during the quarter that we had to plug.","Turning to Slide 19. Looking at price realizations. Really, overall, an exceptional quarter on price realizations, with improvement across the board. You see that oil prices were up 6%, the lower $49 per barrel. NGLs were up the most, up 15% to $19.33. That\u2019s primarily due to higher realizations on propane and butane prices during the quarter. And then gas prices were up 8% for the quarter. And unfortunately, as we move into April, as Tim mentioned earlier, prices have come down some and pulled back some. And so currently, based on where the projections are, second quarter realizations will be slightly lower than the first quarter. Obviously, a lot depends on what happens on the May 25th OPEC meeting and how that will influence oil prices.","Turning to Slide 20 on production cost. For the quarter, production cost in total were up 3%. But as Tim mentioned, the majority of the increase or all the increase, really, was due to production taxes and ad valorem taxes being about 19% quarter-on-quarter. Otherwise, production cost, without taking in account taxes, would have been down 2%. Base LOE for the quarter was flat quarter-on-quarter. Workovers were a little bit higher during the quarter due to the improvement in commodity prices and a little more activity than in the Permian Basin.","Turning to Slide 21. Liquidity position. We continue to have excellent position, with net debt under $400 million. As we mentioned earlier. We did pay off the bond that matured in March, with cash on hand. And we\u2019ve been upgraded, highlight of the quarter, by all 3 agencies, really reflecting the company\u2019s strong financial position and strong outlook for financial cash flow-positive situation.","Turning to Slide 22, looking at second quarter guidance. Daily production of 254,000 to 259,000 BOEs a day for the quarter, so up from first quarter, substantially. And then really, the rest of the items are either consistent with prior quarters or down slightly as we continue to work on our cost structure. And so those are there for your review, I\u2019m not going to cover those in detail.","And so why don\u2019t I stop there and move on ahead and open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Good morning. Tim, I wanted to talk to you a little bit about your plans on a go-forward basis, perhaps to shift, and thoughts around kind of a multi-zone kind of development kind of strategy. Because if we think about the Permian today, a lot of operators are doing kind of 2- to 3-well pads. But if you get into full development mode, how could you \u2013 how do you think you\u2019d adapt that thinking about kind of a multi-zone kind of strategy?","Tim Dove","Yes, Arun, that\u2019s a great question. I think if you look at these zones that we\u2019re talking about completing, there are many now, and in particular, as Joey commented on, the Jo Mill is now coming to fruition with more data. And so when we move ahead, you\u2019re right, we will probably take a look at opportunities to grow more than 2 or 3 well pads. But in principle, one of the main changes we\u2019re making is with 24 well bay models, we\u2019ll actually be drilling 24 wells from a set of well base. Not dissimilar from what we used to do in Alaska. Of course, in Alaska the reason we have well base is because we didn\u2019t have that much space and it had to be indoors.","But in this case, it\u2019s allowing us to have a significantly lower footprint and we\u2019ll be able to drill multiple zones from that 24 well bay scenario, and we have those in place today in the field. And it wouldn\u2019t be unusual within those 24 well base to drill Wolfcamp Bs, come back and drill Wolfcamp As. You\u2019ve got others drilling Lower Spraberry Shale wells, Jo Mill wells and so on. So I think what you\u2019re going to see is that model is where we\u2019re going to go forward, that is to say with our 24 well bay system.","Arun Jayaram","Got you, that\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up. You kind of addressed this, but I just want to make sure I understand. There\u2019s a decent kind of kerfuffle on your oil mix going down a little bit. You highlighted some of the reasons why. As you think about your EURs and the recoveries, is there anything changing relative to EURs and how oil \u2013 in terms of the oil volumes? Or is there just better recoveries through some of the things that Targa is doing, et cetera?","Tim Dove","Yes, I think, of course, when you\u2019re dealing with percentages, corporately, there\u2019s a lot of moving targets and a lot of moving data points. But as it relates to our wells, our wells are coming in, as Joey showed, we can show it in any sort of mix of 3.0 style wells better and better as we apply the new technologies, and actually, just use more in the way of the same sort of completions that we\u2019ve done. And I think that will be the case as we look forward in terms of \u2013 when we go past 3.0 to 3.5 or 4.0. And we\u2019re testing those 15 wells, as I mentioned, this year. I think when you look at it, though, from an internal data\u2019s perspective, these wells come in just like all the prior wells. And so there\u2019s no change in the mix in terms of how well is produced, how they come online.","And as you know, it depends on where you are. It\u2019s not unusual to have the wells coming in at 70%, 75% oil in certain zones and up to 80% or slightly over 80% in other zones. And so we\u2019ve seen no change, whatsoever, in the sort of oil mix in the wells themselves. What does happened through time, as you know, is that the gas-oil ratios go up through time in these wells, and that\u2019s been the case in vertical wells. We\u2019ve drilled 7,000 vertical wells, so we know what we\u2019re talking about here. You can see a gradual increase in GORs, in wells through time. But as it relates to the initial production of these wells, they\u2019re right, spot on.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. Thanks a lot, Tim.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Tim Dove","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","You talked about cost mitigation in part because of the vertical integration that you have. Some of the oil services companies have highlighted that their own cost structures are rising here up bottom. Are you seeing that at all in the areas where you are vertically integrated? And then separately, when we look at the $2.33 per BOE production cost coming from Permian horizontal wells, how should we think about that trajectory over the next year?","Tim Dove","Yes. First of all, on the vertical integration, what you have to sort of figure out in our case is most of our supply that\u2019s needed to complete wells is also vertically integrated, which is to say, we provide, to a great extent, all of our Brady Brown sand, even from our mine or from other mines in Brady. And so we have long-term contracts in place for the third-party sand, which were very favorable \u2013 at very favorable prices. And of course, we produce our own sand at cost. Our water system is very material to this question and we\u2019re delivering water cheaper right now than anybody can do it, and we\u2019re just in the process of building that system out.","So when you look at other costs such as GOR and other chemicals, they have not really moved materially. So the actual cost structure \u2013 and maybe you can also say labor has moved up, say, 2% to 3%. But if you look at the base cost of completing these wells, they\u2019re not substantially higher for us than where they were several months or quarters ago. It\u2019s just that with the tightness in the pumping services, that\u2019s going straight to margin to a great extent, but it certainly won\u2019t affect us. We will just be actually in a position where our pumping services will be making money this year if we just mark-to-market that business in terms of its activities with market price revenue. So I think the fact is it\u2019s going to have a very positive effect, offsetting cost of wells.","Secondly, on your horizontal production cost, I think the $2.33 number is a good number, going forward, for the horizontal Wolfcamp development and Spraberry horizontal well development. I think if you look at it, still the majority of those costs are personnel, electricity, chemicals and so on. And it\u2019s just simply the fact that these are so high-producing wells, especially earlier in their life, that to the extent we continue to accelerate, we can keep that level of cost going forward. As I mentioned, our electricity costs are actually down quarter-to-quarter.","And so I think \u2013 and chemical costs are just essentially flat or up miniscule percentage points. So I think that\u2019s the type of thing we should continue, but realizing as we continue to drill more horizontal wells and they become a bigger part of the total production mix, the corporate numbers on average come down. So speaking of corporate percentages, we benefit in this case, where we contribute more and more of this cheaper horizontal operating cost.","Brian Singer","That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is, with regards to the Jo Mill disclosure here, you talked about $6 million per well for a 10,000-foot lateral. You talked about EUR of 900,000, the BOE at a 6,800 foot laterals. We\u2019re trying to gross up to get you an EUR for a 10,000-foot lateral. Is it apples-to-apples of just gross it up for the increased lateral length, or is there some offsets? And then can you talk about how the Jo Mill would compete at these economics?","Tim Dove","Well, first of all, it has a tremendous advantage to start with big shallower, and that $6 million, $6.5 million number is the result of that. As you look forward and you say, okay, let\u2019s go from 6,500 feet to 10,000 feet, you\u2019re realizing that last 3,500 feet of lateral is not nearly as expensive as the first 6,500 on a per foot basis. So actually, you get incrementally substantial improvements in efficiencies, capital efficiencies as you get to the point where you\u2019re lengthening lateral. And we\u2019ve never seen a case where going from, say, 6,500-foot laterals to 10,000-foot laterals hasn\u2019t been linear essentially, which is what you expect from a physics standpoint that to the extent you\u2019re not getting impacts on hydraulics, which we don\u2019t expect you will at 10,000 feet, but you should have a linear benefit in terms of EUR that comes from longer laterals. And so I think the answer is, one way to look at it, we\u2019re going to be even more impressed with the efficiencies and the economics of Jo Mill. And to the point where I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it has the potential to be right at the top of the seriatim of our drilling campaign.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. Why not a more than limited appraisal, then? Or you just take it month by month there?","Tim Dove","Well, we\u2019re showing 5 wells. I mean, we have, I think, a total of like 5 or 7 more this year. Is that\u2019s right, Joey?","Joey Hall","We have a total of 6 more. We\u2019ve done a total of 12. But I would just echo Tim\u2019s comments, but even more importantly, just keep in mind that those were version 1.0 and 2.0 completions. And for our wells going forward, we do have some larger completions plans. So our perspective on Jo Mill is nothing but getting better. So we\u2019re very encouraged about Jo Mill, going forward. But we\u2019re just really in the infancy of understanding the Jo Mill. It\u2019s a totally different reservoir than everywhere else we\u2019re drilling and we\u2019re just in the infancy right now.","Brian Singer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, Tim. Good morning, everybody. I guess, Tim, thanks for all the color on trying to explain what\u2019s happening with the oil cut. But I guess one of the things that we weren\u2019t aware of ahead in the quarter was Targa had go on this plant, that was mothballed 45 million a day, I think. I\u2019m just wondering, they\u2019re talking about additional debottlenecking, additional plants coming online. I\u2019m just wondering, are we going to see any more of this in terms of incremental expansion of your gas and NGL recoveries as we go through this year based on what you know at this point?","Tim Dove","Doug, what I would say is that we should see a continuing focus, and they\u2019ve done a tremendous job on things we can control this year. And in particular, that has to do with what\u2019s decided on NGL recoveries. As Rich mentioned, the yield in April, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of weakness on NGL prices. So we\u2019ll have to see where we get to there. But there\u2019s no reason for us not to continue to look for ways to reduce line pressures. That\u2019s been one of the very material benefits of, number one bringing on that plant; and number two, doing the looping and the compression work we\u2019ve done. That can still continue.","So I would anticipate, and this is one of the reasons we think the total gas and the mix goes up, that we\u2019re going to still benefit this year. But I think more importantly, next year, as Targa actually brings on 2 new facilities, one in the first quarter and one in the third quarter, is our current understanding, then not only will we be increasing capacity, but again, it\u2019s state-of-the-art capacity, higher NGL cuts. And you\u2019ll have the ancillary effect with the compression of the plants to, again, reduce line pressures. So I only see good things when it comes to our ability to increase gas and NGLs going forward and realizing it\u2019s a bit of a byproduct of what we do when we\u2019re drilling oil wells. But shoot, its positive cash flow, and we\u2019ll take it.","Doug Leggate","Forgive me for the follow-up on that question, Tim, but just help me be a little stupid here for a minute. So the growth rate for oil hasn\u2019t changed, but the percentage has gone down. But the full year guidance for BOE production hasn\u2019t changed either. What am I missing? It seems like the BOE number needs to go higher for that math to work.","Tim Dove","Well, Doug, we\u2019ve put a range in terms of production, as you know. We have a tendency to be conservative. We\u2019re not, at this point, at a position where we\u2019d say definitively that we want to change the production guidance, but you\u2019re certainly on to something when it comes to the fact that on the first case, our first quarter production exceeded our forecast. I think, the real proof\u2019s in the pudding here as we get out of the second half of the year, where we, as Joey mentioned, we\u2019ll be in the 70 to 80 POP range for each of last 2 quarters. We\u2019ve actually popped that many wells if you look back to our history a couple of different quarters in the past. So we have a full capability of doing that. But we\u2019re conservative, Doug, is the answer. And I think, what we\u2019re saying is, our oil numbers look like good. Maybe our gas and NGL numbers can exceed.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate that. And I guess, it\u2019s the final follow-up for me. So obviously, you\u2019ve got back-end-loaded POPs in the second quarter. Can you give us some \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you could normalize that to say what would be the equivalent average wells online in Q2 as kind of this number to help up a little bit? Because I think, some folks out there thought your Q2 guidance is light or low at pretty much your graphic that you\u2019d put up on the last quarter. So any help there would be appreciated.","Tim Dove","Well, we\u2019ll have to get back to you on that specific question to see if we can normalize it. But, I mean, I think the bottom line is \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an example in the first quarter. We only popped 3 wells in January. Similarly, in April \u2013 Joey, how many wells are we going to pop in April, for instance?","Joey Hall","[indiscernible]","Tim Dove","Its 10 wells, so out of a total 60 or 65, so when we say back weighted, we\u2019re not kidding. We\u2019re going to have a lot of POPs in both May and June to catch up to that 60 to 65 number. So normalizing that is a sort of \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a difficult thing to do. But I think the way that and \u2013 Frank, if you can back to Doug with some concept ahead to normalize that, that will be helpful.","Frank Hopkins","Yes, I mean, Doug, even not to show you how complicated it is, but it is. If I have a POP in May, there\u2019s a lot of difference between one on May 2 in May 30th, or May 31st. So \u2013 and all those things are play into it.","Doug Leggate","Kind of April is helpful enough guys. Thanks a lot.","Tim Dove","Right.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Tim and to the rest of your team there. I wanted to ask if you could perhaps \u2013 and this might be for Chris, if you could perhaps elaborate a bit more on some of these technology initiatives that you have. And really, what I\u2019m curious about is if you could maybe talk about which of these initiatives are going to be \u2013 are going to have the biggest near-term impact? And then maybe in contrast to that, maybe not, but which ones are more critical for you delivering on this 10-year path that you have?","Chris Cheatwood","Yes, Charles, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you that the biggest thing is not technology themselves, but it\u2019s the change in the way we work. Because right now, we produce 250,000 BOEs a day. We\u2019re going to 1 million. We have 3,600 employees. We\u2019re not going to have 15,000 employees when we get to 1 million in 10. So all of these technologies kind of add up to be, what we call, people multipliers, work multipliers, however you want to look at it.","But I\u2019ll single out a couple of them that I think are going to be \u2013 well, obviously, the automation, I think, can really help us in that area, reducing field visits, things like that. But you noticed, I spend a little time on the drilling system. I think that one is just going to be huge for us. And to kind of describe, because I figured that we\u2019d get this question this morning.","Really, what we\u2019re building is like a traction control system for your car. We\u2019re always trying to drill wells faster, live out there on the edge, so we can reduce the drill times. But often, we push it past the edge and we produce nonproductive time, a.k.a. like a train wreck well.","Well, what we\u2019re trying to build here is a system, where we can \u2013 it\u2019s like pushing the traction control button on your car that keeps you from sliding off in the ditch if it\u2019s an icy day or something like that. But what\u2019s even more exciting about this is with the capabilities of machine learning, not only are we going to go to a level of prediction to get a warning, we\u2019re going to get to a level of prescriptive analytics, where it\u2019s going to be telling us what to do.","And ultimately, the artificial \u2013 as it learns over wells and number of wells and number of feed, will be to a point where it\u2019s actually artificial intelligence that\u2019s drilling our wells for us, with us observing. And what that\u2019s going to do is just narrow the outcomes on these wells. So instead of, hey, we drilled a record well for $3.5 million and then we have a train wreck that\u2019s $8 million, we\u2019ll start narrowing in on, hey, we\u2019re averaging around $4.5 million or something like that for drilling a well.","So that kind of gives you a glimpse of what we\u2019re after there.","Charles Meade","Yes, Chris, that\u2019s a good metaphor with the traction control and really a great vision. I guess, it\u2019s going to take you guys \u2013 hopefully, you\u2019ll get there sooner than later, but I appreciate the color.","Chris Cheatwood","We\u2019ve got it running right now, so \u2013 not their artificial intelligence, but we\u2019ve got the predictive analytics right now.","Tim Dove","And Charles, one way to think about it is every 1% of NPT, nonproductive time, if you look at the $2.5 billion capital budgets, we\u2019re at $25 million. Every time you can move 1% lower on NPT, it\u2019s big money, especially if you can do it at several percent.","Charles Meade","Got it. And then, my follow-up is, I think I\u2019d probably \u2013 hopefully this is a little simpler. The Jo Mill, should we think about the emergence of this zone as a target as replacing, possibly replacing some of your Lower Spraberry or Middle Spraberry inventory? Is this all going to be additive to that?","Tim Dove","I think it\u2019s part of \u2013 it\u2019s actually, we\u2019re doing, Charles, what I\u2019d call increasing the size of the pie. So it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not looking at the same pie and divvying it now to more Jo Mill. We\u2019re increasing the size of the pie. So we love the Lower Spraberry Shale. We\u2019re liking and loving the Jo Mill even more. You know where we are in Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A.","We\u2019re actually drilling Wolfcamp D well this year. We\u2019re drilling a Clearfork well in Midland County this year. The pie is getting bigger is the way to think about it, and Jo Mill is going to be a big slice, I guess, is the way to think about it. And I think, for that matter, we haven\u2019t even got much data yet in on the Middle Spraberry shale.","And also, as we\u2019ve discussed on the road with a lot of our investors, you look at Parsley\u2019s success with one well in the Wolfcamp C, and that clarifies for us hundreds of locations in Wolfcamp C in the same area. So the pie is getting bigger. I don\u2019t think the pie is getting split differently.","Charles Meade","Got it, thanks.","Chris Cheatwood","Charles, let me just add, too. I think, go back a couple of years, we started with the B. That was basically all we were doing. Then we added the A, and when we got comfortable with the A, we put a lot more As in the mix. And the same thing with Lower Spraberry Shale, that\u2019s where we are with Jo Mill now.","Charles Meade","Got it, thank you, Frank.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Hey, good morning guys. Let me just go back to the [indiscernible] next question one more time. Are you guys assuming that the line pressure benefits unwind to underpin that long-term guidance? Or where is it \u2013 is it a higher EUR I think, that Doug referenced? And maybe secondly, how do you manage the increase in GORs, over time, that you reference as a production profile matures, to support the long-term guide, at least the number you\u2019ve got on 2026?","Tim Dove","Yes, the way to think about the long-term EURs as they\u2019re affected by gas-oil ratios is that a well that might come on at 75% or 70% oil \u2013 77% oil would probably make 70% oil in its life, which means that the gas-oil ratio does go up through time. But that\u2019s just is what it is. That is the nature of the reservoir when pressures are reduced through time and you get below double point, and as a result, you release more gas in the system. It just is what it is.","So what that just simply means in our case is, is that we\u2019re going to need more gas processing capability, more NGL processing capability and more pipelines to move those volumes. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything other than what it is, and we\u2019ve seen it, like I said, for decades in the vertical drilling campaigns of the Permian Basin. When it comes to the oil mix, the oil mix, I think, is certainly going to be affected by the fact that I think we\u2019re going to be successful in continuing to boost our gas and NGL production just because of attention to detail in the field. We\u2019re certainly not saying anything about our oil production of our wells. The wells are coming in great, they\u2019re coming in on prognosis and it\u2019s actually better when you start considering 3.0. I\u2019m hopeful, even better when you start considering the tests that are in excess of 3.0. So what you have is a lot of moving parts here, but I think they\u2019re all moving in the same direction, which is up into the right.","Evan Calio","You stepped in the east \u2013 you stepped east in Glasscock this quarter \u2013 did that have any effect to the NGL gas mix?","Tim Dove","No.","Evan Calio","The second question, if I could, the 3.0 completion performance in the northern area of Lower Spraberry is new and you\u2019re significantly outperforming your main bell type curve with fairly long production history here, clearly long in the 24-hour IPs with some others. When do you think you have enough data to realize that curve?","Joey Hall","So as we characterize, and we talked a lot about kind of where we are in all the development of all of our reservoirs. The Jo Mill is in the first inning. The A\u2019s and B\u2019s are getting into later innings, and I would say the Lower Spraberry Shales are kind of in the middle. We just recently started doing some of the larger completions on Lower Spraberry Shale and we have some more plans this year, where we\u2019re also testing some spacing. But I would say, we\u2019re lagging behind A and B just because we haven\u2019t drilled as many wells and we\u2019ve started the version 3.0 completions later. So I\u2019d say we need another six months to a year under our belt before we have the same handle on those as we do on our As and Bs.","Evan Calio","Great. And I guess, just squeeze in another set of general question in kind of the spirit of the tape here. I know you guys are very well hedged now in 2017, close to zero net debt, some asset sales planned. Yet, I mean, is there an oil price, over time, in 2017 where you reexamine your 2017 program? I leave it there.","Tim Dove","I don\u2019t think so, Evan. We\u2019re running 18 rigs. We\u2019re going to run them through the end of the year, as has been telegraphed and very much localized, we\u2019re not going to change the RPMs of the engine midstream. We\u2019re going to keep running. We\u2019re going to hit this year\u2019s targets. We\u2019ll evaluate next year. I think that next time we really need rigs to keep at a 15% growth rate is next year. We\u2019re just going to keep cranking out our plan.","Evan Calio","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Good morning thanks. I\u2019m just kind of curious on your perspective on the export market, actually. You guys are a leader in helping open that up and have taken some barrels off the U.S. market. It sounds like you\u2019ve planned to continue to press on that. How do you see that playing out for Pioneer, but also broadly, over the coming year? And are you aware of any physical constraints on the ability to export at the Gulf?","Tim Dove","Yes. Thanks, Michael. I really am confident in this. This area of the business is going to be expanding rapidly as we go through time. If you look back, really, over the last few months, this is just a developing market scenario, and it\u2019s developing to the point where there\u2019s cargoes going to various different places. So for example, in the February-March time frame, the biggest importer of our crude oil out of United States was China, and that\u2019s significant because of all the additional refining capacity that\u2019s been put into China, and they can take anything in terms of quality. So we really think China has a lot of potential.","But if you look at, as I mentioned, the cargoes that are going to out in the second quarter, they\u2019re going to, in this case, Wales on the one hand, Italy on the other. And then we\u2019ve had cargoes in the past going to Canada and Venezuela. So what you\u2019re seeing is a burgeoning world market, looking for the style of U.S. crude that basically is excellent across generations of transportation fuels. It\u2019s very high-quality oil. And as we look forward, and in particular, over the next several years, we\u2019re going to be exporting hundreds of thousands of barrels and maybe many millions of barrels a day from the United States as we just process the Permian growth plan, which is going to be mostly all this light sweet oil.","Today, there are new facilities being built on the Gulf Coast as we speak. There are export volumes being moved to course you out of Corpus Christi. We\u2019re actually looking at moving volumes into some of the domestic markets, but some can be exported in areas north of there, out of Houston, for example. So there\u2019s really going to be a lot of opportunities for this business to really dramatically increase in terms of scale and scope.","It\u2019s going to make the United States a geopolitical power when it comes to energy. There\u2019s no doubt about it. And you can make a case, we\u2019re going to be one of the main exporters, and the world is looking for us for sources of supply that are on the one hand, high-quality oil, but also secure. As you know, the Middle East has controlled a lot of the Far-Eastern supply for a long time and Far Eastern countries are interested in taking more secure supplies than have to go through this trader moves.","So, therefore, I think, we have a big advantage, going forward. And as those facilities are developed, we have more VLCCs going there. So; I really see, and I\u2019m expecting big things here.","Michael Hall","That\u2019s helpful color. It seems like a pretty intriguing dynamic. I guess, also then, at the more micro level, I\u2019m just curious on these 15-well testing, kind of this next step-up in completion intensity and other design changes. What would you kind of say a threshold for successes as it relates to what sort of outperformance you\u2019d want to see versus the established Version 3.0? And what kind of time frame are we realistically contemplating?","Tim Dove","First of all, various tests and various zones is the way to capture it. We\u2019ve got some 2,500-foot laterals and 3,000-foot laterals tests that are both in the Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry Shales. We\u2019ve got 3,000-foot tests also in various counties. So there was \u2013 it\u2019s just spread across the acreage. In one particular case, as I mentioned, we have a 5,000-foot \u2013 5,000 pounds per foot job happening in an area, in a particular pad, where we have short laterals.","The objective is can we POP 5,000 pound per foot and create a situation where the economics are just as good and try to mimic of the economics of the 10,000-foot lateral. Those are all underway. We expect the POPs in those cases to be spread. A lot of them will come in the second quarter, but several will come through the year. But we\u2019ll be able to talk more about this.","We\u2019ll probably have some color on this even during our call during August, talk about some of these results. But to answer your question as to what we would expect, as we went from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0, we see pretty significant increases. I would say, in general, it would be in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% bumps in EURs, so that would be a target. If we can do that again, we think that will cover easily the cost of increasing the size of the completions. So if you ask me what\u2019s the target, that would be a great target.","Michael Hall","Thanks, very helpful. Congrats.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Hi, guys.","Tim Dove","Hello, John.","John Freeman","Obviously, the vertical integration and the big infrastructure footprint that you have guided and continue expanding has been definitely distinct advantage. And I know that right now, you are just sort of running that $300 million infrastructure spend, basically constant in the model in the next several years. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of kind of how you all thinking about the trade-off of when you want to build out your own infrastructure versus kind of bringing partners in for either a portion or all of the project, either for financial reasons or just to accelerate the buildout?","Tim Dove","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think, first of all, it somewhat depends on what business we\u2019re talking about because if you\u2019re talking about the water business, for instance, we are executing that ourselves and we\u2019re well into it, as you know. Through time, and in particular, in next couple of years, we\u2019re going to bringing on the Midland Water. We\u2019re building that facility ourselves to further their processing capability for the city of Midland.","And then in exchange for that, of course, we get well priced \u2013 low-priced water to capture our capital cost in that project. But as you go forward, and you\u2019re past 2018, we will need to continue to build subsystems and frac ponds so on and associate with that are processing because we\u2019re going to need to be processing and cleaning up some water for frac quality rather than reinjecting it, we might as well use it in fracs.","And so those costs will continue as part of the $300 million per year. When you start thinking about sand, it could be more chunky. We\u2019ve got a need for expansion of our sand business, and probably, we\u2019ll make a decision on the end of this year for 2019 sand. And as from the today\u2019s volumes, there would actually be a tripling of the sand volumes coming out of Brady. And so we want to execute that, too, and get it done. And we have the engineering already done and we\u2019re going to process that thing.","Today, on gas processing, and as you know, we already have a partner, and Targa, as I said, has done a wonderful job of working with us to improve our fuel deals, and I see that continuing as a partnership. So for the current time, until we build all this stuff out, I don\u2019t really see a need for a partner. We can do it within own our capital wherewithal. We want to make sure it gets done pursuant to our specs and our requirements on time.","We don\u2019t want these things to be an impediment to our ability to execute. So we are going to build them. We\u2019re going to operate them. There\u2019s other alternatives from a capital market standpoint in the future. We\u2019re well aware of those, and we\u2019ll evaluate those when the time comes. But for the time being, we are building our stuff to make sure it\u2019s ready when we need it.","John Freeman","Great, I appreciate the color. And just following up on a comment that you made earlier, Tim, about basically increasing the size of the pie as your activity continues to delineate additional zones and locations and you basically expand the inventory organically. Would these bite-sized sort of divestitures that we\u2019re sort of seeing here in the Permian recently, should we just sort of think about that as that\u2019s just going to become a normal course of business as you\u2019re kind of managing your inventory when certain areas start falling further back in the queue in the Permian as you kind of expand other areas?","Chris Cheatwood","John, this is Chris. Yes, it\u2019s a possibility, but I will tell you that we don\u2019t have a lot of, I\u2019ll call it, fringing areas that are obvious divestiture candidates. So you\u2019re starting to cut some pretty good meat if we\u2019re going to have many more divestitures. And also, as you can see, we\u2019re getting smarter. We\u2019re drilling cheaper. We\u2019re making higher productivity wells. We expect that trend to continue. So really understanding what the value as some of these properties are in the not-too-distant future is still up in the air. So I\u2019d have to say, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a whole lot of that, I mean your spend in the base model, going forward.","Tim Dove","Yes, I think, the way to sort of complement what you said is that we have multi-decades of inventory, which means there\u2019s not a lot of value, perhaps ascribed, to the last set of decades that are in that inventory. So it is a very elegant source of capital if we were to ever need it. But as you know, going forward, our model is to not need additional capital. So our model is to spend within our cash flow and generate free cash flow. So although there is a tremendous amount of value that could be unleashed from those assets and that acreage, well, on the basis, our model doesn\u2019t suggest we\u2019re going to need to tap that.","John Freeman","I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Morris with Citi. [Operator Instructions] Bob check the mute function.","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Sorry, guys. Can you hear me?","Tim Dove","Yes, we can.","Neal Dingmann","Can you guys just talk about, it looks like on the water spend, it was about $300 million last year versus the $160 million this year going forward. What do you anticipate on that?","Tim Dove","Yes, actually, we saw on that slide was $300 million project to date, so over the last several years. This year, we\u2019re spending $160 million. Next year, the plan is $150 million, and that will incorporate, as I mentioned, the construction of the Midland processing facility. At that point in time, I think on a per annum basis, the number goes down considerably. But for this year and next year, we\u2019ve got to build the main system. Really, the backbone pipeline of the system is 100-mile pipeline.","Finishing that this year is imperative. At which point, then the Midland system becomes imperative to add, as Joey mentioned, 240,000 barrels a day of more effluent water. And at that point in time, you\u2019d get in, generally speaking, in the world of just building incremental subsystems and frac ponds where you have the activities. So I see that number going down on annual basis in the future after 2018.","Neal Dingmann","Great, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. On water investment, all the cost savings are \u2013 certainly should be ignored, is it fair to see your water effort is necessary to secure the life for future growth? In other words, is it an important exercise of risk management?","Tim Dove","I will leave it this way. Water is perhaps the most misunderstood and undervalued aspect of the impediments that the industry could face. As Joey said, we are today sourcing 350,000 barrels a day. If nothing changes to how we do with, how we do things 10 years from now, that\u2019s a 1.4 million barrels a day. Today, we represent 8% of the Permian rig count. So when you start doing the math, you realize, oh my gosh, we\u2019re in a difficult situation to be able to source that kind of water, which means we\u2019re going to have to go, as I mentioned, more towards the recycling of produced water that also comes back to us after the frac. And so that has to be in our thoughts, long term. But I think being ahead of this is tantamount to substantial risk avoidance going forward. And we are just not going to be put in a position where we have that kind of impediment that\u2019s unsolvable. We are solving it ourselves.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thank you. Slide 12 shows that the Jo Mill drilling is taking place in both the northern and the southern acreage. Today, are you seeing any more favorable results in one area versus the other? And are there any significant portions of your acreage where you don\u2019t anticipate the Jo Mill to be viable?","Joey Hall","Yes, Jeff, no, we\u2019re seeing good results all over. As a matter of fact, when you go back historically, some of our best Jo Mill wells have been drilled in the southern part of our acreage, and then some of the better ones that you see here on this illustration are in the northern part, central part. So we\u2019re seeing good results across the entire acreage position.","Tim Dove","Yes, the way I\u2019d catch that, just to add, is that if you look back to the vertical drilling campaigns over the last several decades, every single one of those well is essentially completed in the Jo Mill. The Jo Mill is ubiquitous across the whole play, basically, just like the Midland and Lower Spraberry, to a great extent. So it may be slightly better in some areas, but the point is, you have Jo Mill that was being completed in all the vertical wells in the history.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, so massive well control on the Jo Mill. If I could ask one last one real quick. Just to clarify, are your exports entirely black oil? Or do they also include some condensate? And if that\u2019s the case, is there a predictable mix.","Joey Hall","They\u2019re all black oil. They\u2019re all...","Tim Dove","All WTI.","Joey Hall","WTI, West Texas crude.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Phillip Jungwirth with BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip Jungwirth","Thanks, good morning. You guys have been checking all the boxes, really, in terms of what\u2019s needed to achieve the 10-year plan. I\u2019m curious as to whether you think, from transportation, both oil and reside gas, will be needed in the future for Pioneer, given the positive production growth revision for the industry we continue to see out of the Permian Basin?","Tim Dove","Well, first of all, if you\u2019ve been following us, you know we already have 3 different evidence from transportation as we started up the process. But just for a full disclosure, we are looking at further FT commitments for oil that would cover us probably well into the middle part of the next decade. Can\u2019t give any details on those because they\u2019re involved with detailed negotiations now. But I can assure you, we are all over that and we will have it solved at least to the middle of the next decade within a short period of time. On the gas side, we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that 2 big MLP pipeline producers have announced the construction of greenfield pipelines going from Waja, which is in the Permian Basin, to Agua Dulce, outside of Corpus Christi.","That will allow us to swing gas to Mexico into the Mexican market and actually grow further, or through the LNG export markets or for that matter, to Henry hub and then swing it into U.S. market. Those pipelines will be ready in a couple of years. And so accordingly, we do not see any significant bottlenecks on the pipeline arena on any of these commodities, including crude oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids. We are in good shape. Again, we need to complete some FTE negotiations on crude oil. And in that case, we will be in good shape through mid of the next decade. So I think we\u2019ve got that well under control.","Phillip Jungwirth","Okay, great. And then as you guys continue to drill higher-return, lower F&D well and spring \u2013 down throughout the 10-year plan, do you have a sense as to when you could get to a double-digit corporate return on capital employed, say, at $55?","Tim Dove","I think the way to look at that is there\u2019s an inertia that\u2019s associated with all the capital investment we\u2019ve done over the last couple of decades that has to be considered. And so what we\u2019re looking at doing is improving from where we are today. And if you look at the math, just with capital we\u2019ll be spending over the last several years, we can add, probably add an increment, say, 2% to 3% per year at the bottom line when you\u2019re competing at on ROE or ROCE each year, after a few years, you\u2019re there actually. Actually, you\u2019re there at double-digit ROCE and ROE numbers, just owing to the fact that your drilling as you mentioned high return wells.","Phillip Jungwirth","Great, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Hey, thanks. I appreciate it. I know it\u2019s been a long call so far, so I\u2019ll try to keep to one. And Tim, you all have obviously been deliberately increasing concentrations and intensity of the fries that have been on your wells. When do you think is the at which you can step back and say, okay, we understand whether we need to go to 5,000 pounds or a whole back to 3,000 pounds on formation X, but formation Y, we\u2019re going to do this. I mean is, that something that is still a few years away? Or do you think you can accomplish that in, say, see next 12 to 18 months?","Tim Dove","Well, I think you have to look at it along the lines of each zone, right? Each zone is a question mark because we\u2019re testing various different zones. But in particular, when it comes to the version past 3.0, most of those are still focused on Wolfcamp B. Actually, I mentioned there\u2019s going to be 3 wells that are going to be \u2013 of that, that are going to be drilled in the Lower Spraberry Shale. So we will have done a lot of post 3.0 fracs on other zones other than the Wolfcamp B this year. That will tell something about Wolfcamp B. But I think, what this is going to be in the fullness of time that we test the bigger fracs across spectrum. Like Joey mentioned, even in the Jo Mill, you\u2019re seeing good well performance, but a lot of that was a lot of Version 1.0 and 2.0 wells. And so even in the Jo Mill, we\u2019re going to have to see how these 3.0 fracs do and then further to that, as we go past 3.0.","But I think it\u2019s going to take a long time and take many moves to get to the point where we really understand where we get diminishing returns. Also, that\u2019s when you cutoff point is, right, when you realized, oh, we popped 3,500 pounds of sand per foot and you did just as well as 3,000, so you\u2019re going to call it a day there. The other factor that\u2019s involved, of course, is the more we POP, the more logistics we encounter in terms of the strengths of the system, whether it\u2019s for water, sand, what have you. It always has to be considered. So it\u2019s really \u2013 but really, what it all comes down to fruition is when do we see diminishing returns? We won\u2019t know that in several zones for many more years.","Scott Hanold","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Tim Dove","Well, thanks for everybody on the call. Sorry, it\u2019s taken so long. But hopefully, we have some interesting new things to talk to you about. I hope everybody enjoys your last part of your spring and your summer, and we\u2019ll be seeing you on the road in a few events coming up during the rest of May and June, and then we\u2019ll be talking to you again in August. Thanks very much.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal Shah","Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be up first with some introductory remarks. He will then discuss our strong fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, driven by solid execution and continued efficiency gains from the team. After Scott concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance optimized the rate of return, while delivering best-in-class oil production, as well as the drivers behind 2019 strong efficiency gains. Rich will then discuss the benefits of thoughtful long-term planning and the impacts of our cash flow, as well as the benefits from our legacy acreage position. Scott will then return to discuss Pioneer\u2019s focus on sustainable practices. After that, we will open up the call for your questions. Thank you. So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Neal. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you all know, 2019 was an excellent year for Pioneer. As we will outline, we expect 2020 to be even better. When I returned to Pioneer in February '19, we set out a number of specific initiatives to return Pioneer to top performance. I'm happy to report all those objectives we had are now in place and now complete. While its difficult decision, we rightsize the organization reflecting one basin company reducing our G&A to be top quartile. We organized and flatten our reporting structure, which had the intentional benefit of providing greater transparency and visibility across all levels, resulting in a company highly focused on strong execution and capital discipline.","During 2019, we assessed options and monetize long-dated non-core inventory that would have expired with a little or no present value. We reevaluated our capital allocation framework to consider options to increase our cash flow profile and generate stronger returns. Today, we are pleased to announce we have an agreement in place with Targa in our 2020 budget has no capital spinning related to our interest in targets Midland Basin gas processing system. Our noncore inventory monetization efforts resulted in a signed agreement for DrillCo in our Southern JV acreage as well as the sale of approximately 8,000 net noncore acres that yielded approximately $130 million during 2019, pulling value forward for our shareholders in a disciplined and thoughtful manner. ","Lastly, our water system is still under evaluation, and I still expect an update in late 2020. At the field level, our facilities are now optimized to our current growth rate, enabling us to drive the more capital efficient program. Also, we are making great progress as you see in fourth quarter in regard to reducing our lease operating expense cost. 2019 was an exciting year for Pioneer, a year of change, a year where we materially reduced our cost structure, increased our corporate returns, generated free cash, returned significant capital back to shareholders. Thank you to all the employees of Pioneer for their hard work, strong will and determination, the perseverance to achieve at the highest level that drives our company forward. Another milestone happened this week that I've been talking about over the last several months. EIA came out with a report early this week. U.S. Shale is set to increase only 11,000 barrels per day of oil in February, 18,000 barrels a day in March. This is lowest growth in three years. All shale basins are in a decline now, except the Permian. Permian is expected to grow about 40,000 barrels of oil per day, per month in the months of February and March, and I've been estimating roughly about 500,000 barrels a day growth in the Permian over the last several months.","Flipping to our first slide number 3, and getting into the fourth quarter in 2020, I think the top thing, we have generated $385 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. When you look at just the second half of 2019, we generated over $600 million of free cash flow. A tremendous cost reduction we've seen. We will talk more about it later, and Joey will spend more time talking about it. But a 30% improvement in well costs in '19 and 10% decrease in our permanent LOE. Again, what's important, given capital back to the shareholders. We're increasing our divestiture up to $2.20 per share to 185% increase compared to the full year of 2019.","Also in addition, we're continuing to buy back shares. We're up to about $749 million. So we have left about $1.25 billion on our authorization. Also very important in regard to -- we're the best in basin now. We were in second place. We have moved up to the first place with less than 1% of our produced gas layered. And then probably, one of the most important items besides free cash flow, where our focus is to increase return on capital employed. The 11% we delivered in 2019. That's up for 9% in '18 and 4% in '17. What's amazing about that? That's with a 12% drop in oil prices of WTI to achieve that ROCE of 11% in 2019.","Going to slide number 4, obviously, we had a very successful fourth quarter at the high end of production on oil, above total production 363,000 barrels of oil per day. Again, free cash flow of $384 million, also keeping a very, very strong balance sheet. And you can see the summary for 2019. Again, the key point oil production, the top end of the guidance, total production above the top end of guidance.","Going to slide number 5. Again, a really key focus on reducing well costs, a 30% reduction you can see on estimates going from $12.5 million down about $8.5 million per well. That includes full D, C & F costs. We\u2019ll talk to you about each of these items when turn it over to Joey later.","Slide number 6, in regards to 2020 outlook, again, is what we've been talking to the street about 235 to 245 oil sort of production, 383,000 to 403,000 sales of oil per day, all products are sold in premium markets, obviously, including natural gas. Capitol budget, about 3 to 3.3, again, cash flow based on the current strip, and we're almost back to the price that we were using, brings back to about 59 for the rest of the year. This has run on a $60 Brent case, $55 WTI case, the cash flow of about $3.9 billion.","Rich will talk strong hedges in place. And even with WTI going down to $50 WTI, we only see a drop of about $200 of free cash flow. Balance sheet expected to improve down to 0.4 between now and the end of the year. And if you look in the midpoint of oil, we are growing about 14% oil for the entire year.","Slide number 7, in regard to operational plan, again, we've been saying over the last 12 months we'll be adding roughly two to three rigs per year. This gives you the rig count, the number of POPs. It's about 360, about midpoint, same well mix as we saw in regard to 2019.","We have a couple -- two or three new slides that we worked on. These are things we've been saying to the investors in regard to a wide mid-teens growth. It's a combination of execution, free cash flow, net asset value, return on capital employed. And each of these items are protected depending on what growth rate is the out -- the key point of them making the growth rate is the output. But you're trying to accomplish all four of these. I think the key driver is free cash flow and ROCE in regard to how we're running the company today. And we have a great inventory that we can deliver this program for a long time to come.","Slide number 9 shows you the benefit, especially when you have $600 million to $900 million of free cash flow in a $55 WTI price environment for 2020. Maintenance capital is about $2.1 billion now and with our base dividend and dividend increased in part of the growth capital, you can see even $40 WTI that we're able to pay most of this and part of the growth capital even at a very, very low price. So continue to drive down our breakeven price.","Slide number 10, again, it's another way to talk about what we've been discussing in regard to where does free cash flow go. Obviously, we have stated to get our base dividend up to about the average of the S&P 500. We're getting close. Obviously, with our recent increase, long-term, we'll continue to look at further increases in the base. In regard to share with purchases, we'll continue to do that opportunistically. We're still going to have a great balance sheet. As you can see, we'll be driving our debt-to-EBITDA down to about 0.4 in a $60 Brent or $55 WTI price for the entire year. And then, we've been exploring with a lot of our shareholder base over the last several months and will continue as we go out and discuss with shareholders the variable dividend. I think the reason that's been introduced, because everybody knows we have fluctuating commodity prices. And secondly, we do not want to get the base up so high that you run into any type of situation where you even consider cutting a base. And so, the best option is to create a variable dividend and pay that out to the shareholders.","Slide number 11, again, just reemphasizing the fact free cash flow going back to the shareholders. After buying back over $750 million of stock in addition to our dividend going forward about $360 million, so we've got about $1.1 billion combined the two together that we've returned to shareholders. Again, 185% increase from our dividend we paid in 2019. Again, emphasizing ROCR, up to 11%, and that's what a 12% decrease in oil price, as you can see from $65 to $57. Also, you can see this is all prior to the fact that we focused on the cost side of the business.","Going to the slide number 13. Top tier returns driven by low acreage cost basis. As you can see key point here besides the fact that we went up from 9% to 11% in ROCE when you look at using Credit Suisse information that our peer average actually decreased, down from 8% in 2018 to about 6% average. So we're gaining on peer number significantly in 2019, and starting to move above the pack from Tier 2 to Tier 12. And a lot of it has to do with the fact of our cost structure, and secondly, the fact that we essentially have very little investment in most of our 680,000 acres.","Slide number 14, I think, you've seen this already. I think the only other key point here is that there's a couple of key points here to emphasize the fact that starting to see certain large integrated and also some large on Permian companies move to a greater mix in the Midland Basin when you look at the amount of acreage that they have. And so we're seeing that, and I think that's obvious why when you look at the benefits of the Midland Basin, the Delaware. And another key point we will emphasize too when we get into the flaring slides, the ESG slides at the Midland Basin, obviously, we will look at the moment is flaring to slowing on. The biggest culprit is in the Delaware Basin. It's primarily due to the fact that the Midland Basin has been there a long period of time and there's a lot more existing infrastructure.","Again, slide number 15, we probably have the best footprint and worked in a world class asset. That shows the two acreage noncore deals that we made in 2019 for $129 million, in addition over 10 billion barrels of resource base, the 680,000 acres. And in my first opening statement we did make a comment about the fact that we are signed up a lease in DrillCo to drill about nine wells, and that will start shortly in regard to taking acreage that will eventually expire overtime in our Southern JV acreage.","Slide number 16, again, this slide has been around, it just shows you the percent of acreage has been developed, coming out of Wells Fargo, Pioneer leased a pack significantly of everybody in the Permian Basin, years of inventory breakeven in less than $50 WTI. We're way up to the right, and we've developed very little of it is the key point with this slide.","I'm now going to turn it over to Joey.","Joey Hall","Thank you, Scott. Good morning everybody. I'm going to be picking up on Slide 17, continuing a theme from the last two quarters and starting on the left hand side of this slide. You can see that when you normalize gross production for all peers on a two string basis, Pioneer has the highest little percentage. And then moving over to the right, we also have the best 24-month cumulative oil production. So simply state that Pioneer has the oil is production mix and drills the most productive wells in the basin. These two facts, of course, combined should lead to the best margins and the highest returns in the basin over time.","Now moving on to Slide 18, as Scott already mentioned, our execution teams had a tremendous year, most notably by reducing our well costs by 30%. As you can see on the left, a large portion of these savings were driven by significant efficiency gains. Our feet per day in both drilling and completions have improved over 30% since 2017 with most of these gains coming in 2019. And although not highlighted here, and as Scott has mentioned, our operations team also realize significant cost reductions and facility construction, and we've also achieved significant reductions in LOE.","And additionally, as you can see on the right, our field development team continues to plan and deliver best in-basin oil wells. And of course, building up by previous slide, lower well costs combined with increased productivity leads to improved capital efficiency and top tier returns. I would like to offer my congratulations to the entire Pioneer organization on a great year. Thank you to our geoscientists, analysts, engineers, supply chain management team and especially those executing safely out in the field every day for a tremendous year.","And I'll now turn over Rich.","Rich Dealy","Thanks, Joey, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 19. And this slide really there is to highlight the attributes of Pioneer\u2019s assets and the strategies that we employed to improve margin, generating strong margins, as you know, is a key to improving quarter returns, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. You can see it on the graph on the right that we generated share-leading EBITDA per BOE margins. This incremental margin relative to our peers is a function of the higher percentage of oil that we produce in our wells that Joey just talked about, our high net revenue interest in our wells that I will talk more about in a minute, and maximizing the price that we received from the products that we sell by moving into higher priced markets. It's also driven by protecting our cash levels derivatives, and as Scott talked about, a strong focus on reducing our cost structure. If you look at the graph, it is just for the third quarter, just to give you an updated view, recalculated on a four quarter basis, our EBITDA per BOA increased about $31 per BOE, reflecting the benefit of higher commodity prices during the fourth quarter and the company's continued cost reduction efforts.","Turning to Slide 20. This slide really highlights the benefits of our legacy acreage position where we have low bases and high net revenue interest. You can see from the chart on the left, the benefit of having a high net revenue interest. The chart illustrates how much incremental drilling activity that our peers must execute in order to accomplish the same level of growth as Pioneer. In addition to more efficient growth, our high net revenue interest across our acreage also provides for better returns and higher margins as Joey has discussed. And then when you think about it from a drilling inventory report perspective, the chart also illustrates how much faster our peers have to drill through their inventory to accomplish the same level of growth as Pioneer.","Turning to slide 21. This is where we highlight the focus of our improving cash flow margins by moving our product to higher-priced markets and using derivatives to protect cash flow. In particular, during the fourth quarter, we significantly improved our gas price realizations by selling our gas outside of the Permian Basin. With Gulf Coast Express coming online, we transport near the all of our gas to the West Coast or the Gulf Coast selling it there versus selling it in the Permian Basin. This resulted in gas price realizations being $2.21 per MCF versus if we\u2019d sold it in the Permian being based off of Waha Index of $1.11, so a significant uplift.","On the oil side, we transported nearly all of our 220,000 barrels a day production to the Gulf Coast and 95% of it was exported during the quarter. So you can also see on the right side of the page that we have a strong derivative position for 2020, where 67% of our first quarter oil production and 54% of our full year oil production protected with derivatives at $62 Brent prices with upside to the high 60s. As a result of his strong derivative position, our cash flow variability between 55 and 50, as Scott talked about, is only about $200 million. So you can see that we're well-protected in 2020 from oil price volatility.","I'll stop there and turn it back over to Scott for some discussion on environmental progress.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks, Rich. On Slide 22, delivering low mission barrels, you can see where shale oil is a closer to leading the pack in regard to total intensity including methane. This is coming out of a WoodMac report, with McKinsey report that was published recently.","When you look at Slide #23, where the lowest of our peers in emissions intensity where Pioneer on both greenhouse gas intensity and also methane intensity. This is primarily due to the fact that we have some of the best LDAR programs, lead detection and reporting, low-level flyovers that we're using one of the few companies as doing low level flyovers within technology. Our VRU captures vapor recovery units. We\u2019re one of the first to require every gas line has to be connected on essentially all new horizontal wells. And what are the major changes we're making in our ESG in regard to compensation, we're increasing that these from 10% to 15% going forward in 2020.","Looking at Slide 24, in regard to the flaring, obviously, it's been in several newspapers, including the New York Times recently. Pioneer happy to report we're now Number 1 in regard to -- we had been Number 2, when you look at some of the data in 2018. Looking at the data in '19, Pioneer was down less than 1%. At #1, we recently probably had the largest flaring, the first and the largest flaring conference in Austin, Texas that was put on by Columbia and UT Energy Institute. I think coming out of that conference, we have agreed, and we'd like to get all producers committed to this. We're committed to better reporting to all agencies both in the State of Texas and New Mexico. We're committed to sharing best practices among all producers. And thirdly, a couple of interesting ideas came out. We think it's important to set a percent target. And Pioneer would like to be able to continue to produce below 2%. If you look, there's only really six companies that are below 2%. I think every CEO should set a target of 2% or less. It will help solve the problem. And the another interesting idea came out of the conference and the fact it's back to the shareholders, shareholders and public companies, shareholders and private equity companies, shareholders in regard to bonds that are being done is that if all could help and also require companies to be 2% or less, they're not 2% or less within a certain period of time, especially when the two new pipelines come on in the first half of 2021 that you would end up either not doing business or sell whatever you have in regard to that company. That would also help. So those are some of the interesting ideas coming out of that conference. I think it's important to remove that black eye on the Permian Basin going forward.","Final slide on number 25, again, the company, tremendous turnaround from 2018, focused on returns, capital disciplines in place, return of capital in place already. Great, probably, the best balance sheet of any independent in the US. And we have probably the best inventory of any company going forward. So I'm going to stop there, and we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take a question from Scott Gruber with Citi.","Scott Gruber","So you're investigating the possibility of a variable dividend, Scott, how do you think about where the prudent think of the base dividend. You say in the deck that you will continue to increase it. How do you think about where to take it? Do you think about percentage of cash flow, percentage of cash flow above maintenance CapEx and framework on that front would be great?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, we haven't established a percent. I mean, we're looking at other \u2013 and studying other industries that have had variable dividends. We've had several companies in other industries that have accessible variable dividends. We've got a lot of those comments from in talking to a lot of our shareholders over the last 12 months. We'll be going out again and visiting with our shareholders over the next two to three months in March and April, with deployment and talking to them and go into a couple of the conferences, and still trying to establish it. But at the end of the day, we already have a great balance sheet. And we're going to establish a base and then base is going to be, say, eventually close to the S&P 500 around it, and we're slight increases going forward on that base. But then when you look at the amount of free cash flow the company has, and we've mentioned before, I did in the Barkley's conference, that we have over $5 billion in cash over the next five years, you still have sufficient amount of free cash flow. What do you do with it? And like I said, don't want to -- and most of our shareholders that we've discussed, do not want an EMP company getting your base up so high. And so it leads toward a variable dividend. And so we'll have to come up with the mechanics as we develop our first year -- significant free cash flow over and above our base dividend in any stock buybacks. That's what's left and have to come up with a plan. And we'll be visiting with everybody as we speak with you over the next several weeks.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes. And Scott, just one other thing to add to that, we believe that it's important to have a stable and growing dividend. So I think that\u2019s kind of underpinning on the base. But we also think about that growth needs to be consistent over time with the S&P 500 or slightly better. So -- and that's where we want to -- overtime, lead the base dividend.","Scott Gruber","Great. And unrelated follow-up. If I look at Slide 5 in the deck, you guys have made great progress on well costs during 2019. You showed continued efficiency gains into '20. If I divide the midpoint of your core CapEx, it\u2019s like about 315 of your top guide of around 360. I come to an average well cost at around the 2019 average. Why isn\u2019t that simple math showing a greater reduction? Is there something that's impacting the year-on-year comparison?","Neal Shah","Hey, Scott. It's Neil. If you look at what we did in 2019 and a capital program, the 2020 capital guidance also includes any potential rig gas towards year end that we require for 2021, again, similar to what we did last year. So that's embedded in there as well. Also that range encompasses somewhat and correlates to the range in POPs. So there's a correlation between the two. Also, I'd say, if you look at a strong efficiency gains that we experienced throughout 2019 that led us to over accrue slightly based on Q2 and Q3. So there's a one-time benefit to Q4 such as the Q4 run rate would be somewhat higher. So, if you encapsulate all those three factors, that kind of leads into the range where we currently stand.","Operator","We will now take a question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Scott, you've previously talked about $5 billion of cumulative free cash flow over a 5 year period. I'm curious with the significant reduction in well costs that you've shown here. What you were assuming in that $5 billion number. I'm just curious how you see that free cash flow visibility today at under the same price deck?","Scott Sheffield","No. The number really hasn't changed, Doug, since my announcement in September, at the Barclays Conference. So the number is still about, look, it's a little over. We\u2019re rounding off that to $5 billion of free cash flow, and that's in $55 WTI flat during that timeframe. Obviously, more bullish, especially with U.S. shale essentially slowing its growth significantly going in 2020 once we get through the coronavirus demand issues. I'm more optimistic that we're going to see a much higher price deck over the next five years. And that number will increase substantially. And as we go out over time, that number will increase, even in a flat price of the market, because the first couple of years, it's a little bit lower and then it increase significantly as you get into year 2022 through '23, '24. The number keeps increasing significantly.","Doug Leggate","Thanks for the color. My follow-up is just a couple of things you mentioned in your prepared remarks about DrillCo and the water still under evaluation. I just wonder if you could just bring it up-to-date as to how you see that the potential for additional noncore. I don't want to say divestments, but initiatives through lease additional volume, especially from your longer-dated acreage. And if you could bolt-on for that, just remind us what the invested capital in the water business is as of today? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","In regard to the water, as I stated before, we do not want to trade costs. I think most of the companies that are doing water deals, they\u2019re doing disposal deals, and they're basically trading -- they're bringing in capital or cash for the balance sheet and their operating costs are going up. And so, we just don't want to trade costs. And that's why we're taking more time and we won't make a decision until late 2020. So we just don't want to trade costs. We see an increase in our LOE costs.","Unidentified Company Representative","And Doug, in terms of the dispositions, I think as we did in 2019, similarly, we'll look to opportunities to continue to monetize long data to noncore inventory in an effort to pull that value forward to shareholders. But they'll have to be when they come to fruition. So nothing on the docket, just we'll continue to look at it.","Doug Leggate","I was going to say how's he appetite for acreage deals at this point? Is it pretty quiet or how would you characterize that? And I leave it there. Thank you.","Scott Sheffield","I characterize it pretty quiet. I think, here's the activity level. They\u2019re strategic in nature. What you've seen this people doing deals that are locking up acreage, similarly doing trades. And so just making drill longer laterals.","Operator","We will now take a question from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.","Arun Jayaram","Scott, I was wondering if you could, perhaps elaborate on details of the target agreement and how this will impact, I call it, the go forward financials as you're no longer going to be incurring that CapEx.","Rich Dealy","Hey Arun, it's Rich. I'll tackle that one. We've been working with Targa as Scott mentioned for a number of months on our non-content agreements that we recently completed. So with that agreement done, they will fund the capital going forward on 100%. And they'll get 100% of the revenue on new plans, but we'll still retain our cash flow from the existing plans. So the benefit that we show in LOE and have been showing will continue from our existing ownership and those plants that we invested in the past, but future ones Targa will take the revenue from that.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just maybe a follow-up to Scott\u2019s question, on the variable dividend. What is the path from here? You're going to be evaluating this with your major shareholders. Scott, what are your philosophical views on this? And if you did decide this year to shift to a variable dividend call it distribution type model in addition to the base dividend, what are you thinking about in terms of timing of implementation?","Scott Sheffield","Well, like I said Arun, the first thing, the first comment is that I'm going to say most maybe 75% to maybe as high as 90% plus of shareholders that I've talked to, and we'll talk to, they prefer dividends over share buybacks. So I'm starting with that premise. Secondly, we don't want to get the base too high as we are seeing with major oil companies. And we have seen with refining industry as to where the EMP industry can\u2019t support it. So that leads to an alternative when we have $5 billion plus of excess cash flow. And I think we're generating, right now, our dividend payout is roughly $360 million a year times five years. So what's that $1.8 billion, close to $2 billion. So we're paying out $2 billion already with our dividend of $5 billion. So we have $3 billion left to pay out under that price scenario. And so that leads toward a variable dividend. We've got a fluctuating commodity price market. And the question is how much of that and the timing of it, and when to pay it out? And we're still working through the mechanics in learning about how other companies do it in other industries. And we'll be speaking with people over the next several weeks about how to put it.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","My question is on your FT agreements. My question is on your FT agreements. I believe Pioneer has now well over 200,000 barrels a day of firm transport to the Gulf Coast. And I think that's supposed to grow over time with production, maybe not exactly in lockstep, but that it would kind of keep pace. I'm not sure if I'm thinking about that credit lease or any color would be helpful. But, I guess, what I'm getting that is the WTI Brent spread has been narrowing relative to where it's been over the past two years or so. And you've got some kind of spread that you need to breakeven on your contract. So I just wanted to check in to see if there is any appetite to revisit the amount of incremental FTE you take on from here on out over at a medium or the long-term?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Jeanine, you are correct that we are moving about 220,000 barrels a day. That does grow over time to over 300,000 barrels a day that matches our growth profile going forward FT. I still think that moving it to the Gulf Coast in long term will be advantageous for getting it to higher priced markets, where we can get Brent pricing for it. Yet today, it\u2019s kind of a neutral breakeven proposition, but for the year, we made $283 million. So I think there will be time to still -- is advantageous to get the higher price markets. So I don't think we're going to change that strategy. I think in general, with the differential between Midland and Brent price is being $4 to $5 a day, it's a breakeven type transaction. But we are making sure that we're available in there and we could benefit when we see price spikes in the future.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks. I appreciate the time. I'm just kind of curious as I think about efficiencies and all the costs improvements that you rolled through the system in 2019 kind of set yourself a pretty high bar there. How do you think about further efficiency gains in 2020 and beyond? What can really move up from there? Or are we really just kind of looking at incremental changes? And what sort of key initiatives you have in place for further improvements in 2020?","Joey Hall","This is Joey. Yeah, I think, as we pointed out that whenever you have a year, where you get almost 25% efficiency gains in one year and 30% cost improvement, it's not reasonable to expect that you would duplicate that the following year. And I think one of our slides basically references a trajectory we shouldn't expect it to be the same. Having said that though, that doesn't mean that we're not still being relentless about focusing on those initiatives and continuing to drive our costs down, and we continue to do so even as we move forward, we see efficiency gains every day. But like you said, we shouldn't expect to see a similar step change. But as for what are we going to focus on that we're going to continue to focus on the things we've been focused on. And that's primarily just looking at the efficiency side, lane manufacturing methodologies and being relentless with KPIs and measuring what we're doing out in the field, and trying to understand better and more effective ways to go about that, continuing to leverage technology as it develops through our service companies and through our internal efforts and taking on those kinds of things. We're trying to make our practices consistent all across the field, taking kind of a Southwest Airlines methodology, or any pilot can fly any plane and having consistency across all of our drilling rigs and frac fleets. So just the combination of all those efforts leads me to believe we still have several bites at the apple, but to expect that it would be similar to what we saw this year is probably not reasonable.","Michael Hall","That's helpful. And I guess as a follow-up on a similar topic then, and you've talked about for a long time or late last year plus two to three wells, sorry, two to three rigs -- incremental rigs to maintain or sustain the mid-teens gross in oil. Is that something that maybe over time the required rig adds gets muted or any evolution in that? I guess as you think about 2021 and beyond?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Michael, I know that we always try to communicate and use things like rig adds and frac fleets and POPs as proxies to determine future performance. But you know, I think, stating the obvious, when you have a 25% improvement in cycle time in one year, you cannot change that mentality. And frankly, my team's focused on trying to do the same amount of work with less equipment. So like you said, when you have -- or like I said when you have a 25% improvement, that implies that you need 25% less equipment. So it's getting more and more difficult for us to explain our business based on rig adds. Having said that though, I -- that's still kind of our mentality that we'll continue to focus on the growth and our expectation would be based on current efficiencies that two to three rig adds per year would be kind of the measure by which you should see our activity increase, but those numbers change by the day.","Operator","We will now take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","You'll show the average pad size in 2020, moving up a little bit to four wells per pad. Is the well spacing still similar to what you all kind of characterized in the past, kind of around that 850 foot spacing?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, John, whenever we talk about increasing pad sizes, that's really not a reflection of a well spacing. It's more a reflection of doing more stack developments. So the short answer to your question is that does not imply any change in our well spacing. Our well spacing is basically staying in the same area, 800, 850 feet for the Wolfcamp zones.","John Freeman","Okay. And then just the follow-up, should we anticipate the pad size sort of continues to kind of creep up in the subsequent years? Or is kind of four wells per pad about the right number?","Scott Sheffield","No, I would expect as we increase the amount of stock developments that we're doing and co-developments that we're doing that you would see that increase in time. A good example is, last year, I think 35% of our targets were a single zone targets, and this year that's down to 15%. We'll continue to drive that down as we kind of hone in our development. And so you'll see the number of wells per pad creep up over time.","Operator","We will now take a question from Joseph Allman with Baird.","Joseph Allman","Good morning and thanks for all the comments. So my question is about natural gas and NGLs. It\u2019s not the most important part of your portfolio, but it's so important. What assumptions do you make about, say, Waha gas prices going forward? Do you assume basically close to zero? What assumptions you make about NGL prices? And what do you do to maximize the value of those assets as production increases?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Joe, I think the big thing on natural gas is that we have very little gas. It's now exposed to Waha, virtually all of our gas is either going out West and getting out based on Socal index or going to the Gulf Coast on a Henry Hub or NYMEX Index. So we've made steps to make sure that we're not really subject to Waha. I think, as you say, until a bunch of more pipes get built at Waha is going to be low. So, I just think that we're focused on getting it out of basin, get into higher priced markets. What the longer term look at LNG and moving in international like we've done on oil. NGL, it's hard to will make sure that we \u2013 all our NGLs are processed at Mont Belvieu. And, but given what's happened with the amount of liquids that are getting at Mont Belvieu and given the weather we've had in the winter and just lack of demand for it, I expect the NGL prices still to be weak for a while. They were good in the fourth quarter or better in the fourth quarter, and they've fallen back something here in the first quarter.","Joseph Allman","That's very helpful. And then just as follow-up. Scott, you made comments about some of your bullishness on oil related to the slowing down of shale growth. But, could you just give us your kind of macro view, kind of over the next several months into the next couple of years?","Scott Sheffield","Yes. So I think, I mean, OPEC really had to go into the coronavirus. Brent was up to $65 and WTI was up to $60. So, coronavirus hit. As that is peaking, as we get into the summer months, I'm confident that the price will be up another five bucks, and it should stay there. Most of the non-OPEC fields are coming on this year. Very little non-OPEC fields coming on in '21, '22, '23, '24, and that's why I'm a lot more bullish in regard to price. Bullishness, I hope it doesn't go up too much, but somewhere in that $65 to $70 for Brent.","Operator","We will now take a question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wanted to go back, you\u2019ve touched a little bit -- you made a few comments about the DrillCo, but I think you said 9 wells. Is there anything else you could offer about how big that was whether it's four sections, 10 sections? And are we getting the right feel that we shouldn't look or in the current circumstances, we shouldn't look for a repeat of that?","Rich Dealy","Yes, Charles. This is Rich. I think \u2013 I would, we would need to execute it first. And so, this DrillCo and our Southern part of the acreage, and they\u2019ll start in the second quarter of this year. And so, I'd say let's just wait and see overtime. And as we get that one done, then we'll see what may be next.","Charles Meade","Okay. Thanks for that, Rich. And then, and then this is perhaps for Joey. Going back to the pad size bumping up to four on average this year, there are two questions on it. One, what's the dispersion around that mean? In other words, or maybe that\u2019s the same thing differently, what percentage of your pads are going to be 4-well pads? Is that kind of a really -- a truly representative thing? And then should we beyond the look up for anything different as those bigger pads roll through your operations and then show up in the financials?","Scott Sheffield","So on the first part, that average is made up of -- we still have a relatively significant portion. I can't remember the exact percentages. But we still have quite a few 3-well pads. I would say, 4-well pads, 5-well pads and 6-well pads are growing in percentages year-over-year. I think for this year, 4-well pads will be the predominant percentage and then slowly followed by the 5 and 6-well pads. As for how would that show up in our financials? Of course, the more activity we can put on one location, so there's an opportunity to continue to drive down well costs. One of the other aspects of this that may seem a little bit more subtle is in our typical cycle time for a 3-well pad is about 180 days. Of course, whenever you have that fourth well on, that increases your cycle time. So that may have the opportunity depending on the dispersion of the pads throughout the year to make production a little bit lumpier, and the timing of bringing those pads on, create some noise in the production. But overall, it's a net positive because it also goes back to our development strategy and doing code development, which helps us with increased well productivity. So as we move in that direction, it just shows certainty in our development plan. And it does nothing, but reap great benefits the only downside being the slightly longer cycle times.","Operator","We will now take a question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Take a look at your LOE cost came in below expectations grow at least below your guidance. And part of that is that gas processing, I guess recovery, I'll call it that you all get. Could you give us some color on how you see that going forward through this year, especially now that you're going to be non-consenting on some of the target stuff? And really what are the ebbs and flows to that then? And is that in some of your forward guidance?","Rich Dealy","Yeah, we built it into our guidance range for production costs. That natural gas processing benefit really is dependent on where NGL prices sit for the most part and to a lesser extent residue gas because most of the contracts out there are driven by POP contracts. So that's why when you look across the bottom of that chart, it ebbs and flows little with NGL and gas prices. But going forward with the -- I don't expect it to meaningfully change over the next few years just because we're going to bring in one plant later this year, the gateway plants, the target's bringing on and so there just won't change a whole lot going forward other than tracking with commodity prices, NGL and gas prices.","Scott Hanold ","Okay. That's appreciated. And sticking, I guess, on NGLs. And your price realizations on NGLs were really strong, I guess, relative to a lot of your peers. Again, is that attributed to some of the gas processing and the better NGL yields are getting on these new plants?","Rich Dealy","Definitely. We've seen our NGL protection up. Obviously, these new plants have higher recovery levels, but they've also tried to increase the recovery levels across the system because NGLs are better priced than Waha Gas, where a lot of that gas ends up being sold other than the stuff that we take in kind from a processor standpoint. So, unfortunately, first quarter ethane and propane prices are a little bit lower. So we\u2019re not going to have quite the realizations in the first quarter that we had in the fourth quarter.","Scott Hanold","Yeah. Is there a way to explain why you guys were in the fourth quarter strong relative to some of your peers? Is there something unique about the fourth quarter or just how you guys sell yours?","Rich Dealy","Nothing unique that I can point you out, and I don't, I'm not familiar enough about the peers have reported or how they market it. So I can't really speak other than given our size and scale, maybe we have a little bit better POP contract.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","I wanted to pick up on the topic of cost efficiencies from here. And Scott, big picture, when you came back as CEO, you noted the Pioneer\u2019s well costs in the Permian were too high and then you subsequently lowered costs and improved efficiencies. Are you where you want to be now? And do you now view your well costs positioned as sufficiently competitive based on the size, scale and quality of Pioneer\u2019s acreage?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Brian. I've seen some offset data from other peers. And this is the first we're actually beating some of the Permian peers now, especially in the Midland Basin. I know we're beating Delaware, but you can't really compare Delaware since it's a higher cost area. But looking at some of the Permian Basin companies and disclosures, we are definitely as competitive or better than most companies today. And I still anticipate, as Joey said, we're going to continue to achieve more reductions. So, in our long-term plan, we show a certain number of rigs. I don't think at the end of the day, we're going to be adding two to three rigs every year to get the same growth rate over the next 10 years.","Brian Singer","And then, my follow-up is on that mid-teens growth longer-term plan and the points that you bring out on Slide 8. You talked about the free cash flow and ROCE maximization as your focus. And I wanted to ask about one of the other points, which is in execution. How do you when you think about trying to continue to grow from an already decently high days, mid-teens growth? How do you focus on the short and long-term risks to execution? What do you see in 2020 as the key potential for upside and downside risks from an execution perspective that you and the team are focused on?","Scott Sheffield","I think we've taken the risk off the table. So I mean, to me, I see very low risk at all. We've taken it off the table. We've proven it after overspending $850 million in 2018, and under-spending $700 million in 2019. It's one of those items I think that everybody is focused on. Everybody has held accountable. So I don't even look at it as a risk anymore. And in regard to the free cash flow and capital, just to make a further point, right now, I think we have about $1.8 billion of the $5 billion spoken for -- $5 billion plus free cash flow, and that's in the base dividend. We'll continue to allocate that mostly to buybacks and also to potentially that variable dividends.","Operator","We will now take our next question from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Scott, I just wanted to follow-up on the considerations around your water business. Outside of financial market arbitrage, what would be some of the variables or considerations that would prevent you from monetizing the business?","Scott Sheffield","Well, to start off with, I think, most of the peers that have done. In my opinion is that their balance sheet is still too high. They have too much debt. And they're using the proceeds to reduce the balance sheet. So, we don't need to do it for that reason. So, we have to decide what multiple that we do sell a portion of it. In fact, we're probably gonna rule out selling. I think I've already said this. We're going to roll out selling the entire thing. It's too important for us. It\u2019s a question whether or not we bring in a long-term partner, as we continue to build it out. Then so \u2013 and it\u2019s just something that we're going to make a decision on by the end of this year. So \u2026","David Deckelbaum","And then my follow-up is just this year you guys are having that consistent well mix of Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B is about 80% of your wells turn in. At what point in the future if you started seeing a greater contribution from some other zones, you all have made some headway at Wolfcamp B over the last couple of years of the delineation effort. Is any color you can provide around just what that development looks for now? And if that there's a shift away from Wolfcamp A and B to some extent in the other year?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, David. We prioritize our portfolio every year based on returns. And as far as looking from last year to this year, the major shift that you'll see is kind of more equal percentage of Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B together. That's primarily because of the fact that we're focused on co-development continuing to deliver a significant number of Jo Mills because they have strong returns. Wolfcamp B will continue to be a small part of our portfolio at this point in time. We're focused on understanding the development strategy for the Wolf camp B. And focusing on getting the returns up and whenever we feel like we've got that perfected and got other returns similar to what we'd see in the Wolfcamp A, B and Jo Mills and lower Spraberry shale, we'll start to bring those in. But, the short answer is, we're not really doing it just based on a portfolio. We're doing it to make sure we maximize the returns that we can for each and every year.","Operator","And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sheffield for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you all very much. Look forward to the call next quarter, and hopefully, you'll get to see a lot of you all over the next few weeks, and several months as we get out on the road. Thanks again.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17172":["Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  1, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank E.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins","Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly go over the agenda for today's call. Scott is going to be up first. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the second quarter of 2012. He'll then discuss the company's plan to pursue a joint venture partner to accelerate the development of Pioneer's industry-leading position in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale. He'll also update you on our increased production growth forecast for 2012, and capital spending plans over the remainder of the year. After that, Tim will be up. He'll discuss our drilling results and plans for the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale, Spraberry vertical wells, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Barnett Shale Combo play. He'll also update you on our activities in Alaska. Rich will then cover the second quarter financials in more detail and provide earnings guidance for the third quarter. And then after that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Nice, Frank, and good morning. On Slide #3 in our highlights, we had a clean adjusted income number of $98 million or $0.78 per adjusted share. Second quarter production, which we had already press released a couple of weeks ago, totaled over 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Spraberry production was negatively impacted by about 4,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to unplanned third-party NGL fractionation capacity shortfalls at Mont Belvieu. Did include 2,800 barrels a day associated with NGL inventory build, which we do expect to sell between now and the end of the year, and 2,000 barrels a day from ethane rejection that will continue. Production would've been about 155,000 barrels a day without the negative impact, which have been at the high end or above our guidance of 149,000 to 154,000 barrels a day. We were up 4,000 barrels a day versus the first quarter, primarily driven by the production growth in Spraberry, Eagle Ford, Barnett and Alaska. One note is that all production is up 70% over the last 12 months with Pioneer.","Increasing 2012 production growth, our target range, which was 23 to 27, up to 25 to 29, as strong drilling and well performance is expected to outweigh the continued third-party NGL fractionation capacity shortfalls and our reduced second half drilling activity. Between -- to advance the successful Horizontal Wolfcamp Shale plays, we're announcing 5 additional wells, very successful, for a total of 7. The program is way exceeding expectations. Increasing our estimated ultimate recovery to 575,000 barrels oil equivalent for 7,000-foot laterals in our southern acreage. Also, we're announcing, of the next several months, we're pursuing a joint -- looking for a joint venture partner to accelerate horizontal Wolfcamp Shale development in our southern 200,000 acres of our total perspective acreage position. We'll talk more about that in a minute.","Going to Slide #4. Continued on highlights. Our deeper vertical drilling to the Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian continue to drive the strong Spraberry performance -- out-performance in that field. Also, what's important, maintaining our drilling capital at $2.4 billion by reducing second half activity in response to the recent -- in the last 60 days, the price of WTI coming down from roughly $100 to between $85 and $90 from lower commodity prices.","We're taking the Spraberry rig count down a little bit quicker than we anticipated in this price environment, from 40 to 30, reducing the Barnett rig count from 2 to 1. Also, we're looking at reducing the Spraberry vertical rig count from 1 to 3 rigs. In addition, we have terminated some third-party fracture stimulation fleets and are now predominantly using Pioneer fracture stimulation fleets, saving lots of capital there. We liquidated some gas derivatives, in 2014 and '15, several weeks ago. And the market obviously has moved up since then, substantially, with cash proceeds of about $143 million. And also recently when oil peaked at about $93 just recently, we went ahead and added 8,000 barrels a day of oil swaps for the next -- for the last 5 months of 2012, which puts us close to 100% of our oil hedge for the rest of this year.","We completed a successful tenure senior note offering of $600 million at 3.95%, and with the S&P upgrade, we've recently been upgraded by Moody's.","The Wolfcamp Shale joint venture opportunity on Slide #5. With the data room opening up in September, we're offering 1\/3 to 50% of Pioneer's working interest in approximately 200,000 acres in the southern portion of the Midland Basin, which is about 8% to 12% of our total acreage position, when you look at a partner obtaining either 1\/3 or 50% of our 200,000 acres. It's going to include all Wolfcamp intervals, A, B, C and D. There's 4,000 potential horizontal development locations, excluding down-spacing potential. Our 4,000 locations, we are drilling now on 140-acre spacing as you see with activity like in Eagle Ford oil where people are taking that play down to 53-acre spacing. So it's huge potential over and above the 4,000, and over above the 2-billion-barrel gross resource potential. The 2 billion barrels are just associated with the 4,000 locations.","Oil content, greater than 70%, with liquids greater than 90%. Estimated ultimate recovery, in this acreage, about 575,000 barrels of oil equipment for a 7,000 foot lateral. Been a current environment of $85 oil flat and $4 gas flat, $7 million well cost delivers a 45% before tax IRR.","The primary purpose of the shale JV opportunity is to accelerate development, enhances our net asset value and project returns, allows us to de-risk the play with somebody else's capital. And that also allows us to shift capital to Midland,  Martin, and our counties to the North, to prove-up additional Wolfcamp where we own essentially about 100%.","Going to Slide #6. Increasing our 2012 production growth target. Again, as had I mentioned before, we're going from 23% to 27%, up from 25% to 29%. Obviously, our strong drilling, in all of our key areas, is outweighing what's happened on the NGL fractionation at Mont Belvieu. Again, going into 2, 3 years, beyond 2012, we'll wait until early 2013 to come out with that guidance. But, again, that's very dependent upon commodity prices and service cost going forward.","Capital spending for the second half of the year and cash flow on Slide #7. As I had mentioned earlier, we kept our drilling capital at $2.4 billion by reducing certain areas in activity. Vertical integration, $500 million. We did add about $100 million for expanding field facilities, primarily in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, that'll carry us for several years with our accelerated activity over the next several years in those 2 key areas, for a total of $2.9 million. Funded from operating cash flow, equity proceeds, liquidated derivatives and inventory -- pipe inventory reduction, South Africa divestiture and South Texas acreage sale.","Going to Slide #8. Again, another slide to emphasize the fact that the first half capital spending was weighted toward the first half due to a second rig drilling in Alaska, which drilled 2 exploration wells, which we owned 100% of each of those wells. Running 40 Sprayberry rigs in the first half, going to 30 the second half. We did accelerate our frac bank reduction of 40 wells, so a lot more completion cost in the first half. A lot of capital, we're spending about $2 million extra for science in the first half, on horizontal Wolfcamp wells and then Seismic acquisition, primarily in the Permian.","I'm going to the second half, we'll be running somewhere between 27 and 30 Spraberry vertical rigs, 4 horizontal rigs until the very end of the year, where we'll be adding 3 more rigs ourselves, regardless of what happens on the joint venture. The joint venture does go through, obviously, we'll be running more rigs going into 2013 and '14.","12 Eagle Ford rigs, 1 Barnett Shale Combo rig, 1 Alaska rig, and again, predominantly using our own frac fleets, the second half of the year.","And finally, on Slide #9. South Africa should be closing in the next couple of weeks. We're predominantly a U.S. asset-based company. We have increased our resource potential up to 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We think there's additional upside from this number. This has increased primarily with the Southern Wolfcamp acreage play. As we move into Midland and Martin County, we think there's tremendous upside to that number as we expand the Wolfcamp play up north.  Again, we've got 4 great core areas. The joint venture is going to, obviously, accelerate the development of the Wolfcamp Shale play. Vertical integration substantially improves returns, we have a great derivative position that protects margins over the next 2 years, and a strong investment grade financial position.","Let me stop there and turn it over to Tim to go more into the Wolfcamp.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. We're pleased to finally be able to report our drilling results from the early campaign in the southern 200,000 acres that Scott was referring to in the Horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play. In summary, the early results from the program are exceeding our expectations. But, first, let me do this, let me update you on the Giddings wells in Upton County. Those were the first 2 horizontal wells drilled several months ago to the north. And as shown on the slide, we've had phenomenal results from these wells. The first of which has made 107,000 BOE in about 9.5 months. The second of which made 83,000 BOE in 7 months. Again, this is roughly about 7x the amount of volume that would -- a typical 140,000-barrel type curve from vertical wells would make. And I'll refresh your memory that these wells actually naturally float up tubing until only about 1.5 months ago. So now, only in the last 1.5 months have we put the wells on artificial lift. You'll see in the box to the right that we have a conservative 650,000 BOE -- EUR for these wells. Realizing their stimulated lateral lengths are only 5,300 feet. As we increased the length of those laterals you'll see the EUR to the north grow considerably. And the important thing about the wells is they are still exceeding expectations. Even in terms of current production, they're averaging about 365 BOE per day, which is, again, a phenomenal result for these first 2 wells and is indicative of what we expect as we go north onto our acreage.","Now, let's turn to the south. As Scott mentioned, plays 5 B interval wells on production during the quarter, mostly there in Southern Upton and Reagan Counties, as the map shows. And the actual data for these wells, all 5 of them, detailed or shown in the table below. Importantly, the wells have done exceptionally well, 300 to 600 BOE per day, in terms of peak 30-day IP rates. Of course, we think that peak -- the 30-day peak rate is really more indicative of performance than the 24-hour rate. And importantly, a lot of these wells are really doing phenomenally in terms of showing stabilized production. In fact, the total of the 5 wells, on average, they're still producing over 300 barrels a day over the last 7 days. So it goes to show the wells are holding up beautifully. And the last of the wells, as shown on the table, University 10-13, is -- still, today, naturally flowing up casing and showing excellent rates as shown on the table. And so we're actually considering completing all of the wells perhaps in the future in this fashion, so as to be able to move fluids faster. And as you can see we're continuing to really refine the optimal completion techniques on these wells, and I think you'll see improvement as we go forward, based on all the technology we're applying. And importantly, as we move ahead, I think the production rates and EURs will also increase in relation to the increase in stimulated lateral lengths. The numbers we quote today, on EURs, are based on 7,000-foot laterals. We'll be looking at drilling some 9,000-foot laterals in the second half of the year. And as Scott mentioned, just based on 7,000-foot laterals, we've increased the EURs in the southern area, to about 575,000 BOE. You'll recall, our range, prior to having this data, was more in the range of 350,000 BOE to 500,000 BOE. So the results look very, very good in the early stages of our drilling campaign.","Turning now to Slide 11. This slide is focusing on the future activity in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play, the rest of this year and into next year. Of course, our activity, as shown on the map, in the oval there, is related to trying to hold the 50,000 acres that would otherwise expire at the end of 2013. And toward that end, we have to drill about 90 wells or so, between 2012 and '13, to hold that acreage. So, today, we have 4 rigs running. We'll be increasing that to 7 rigs in the late part of the year. Those rigs are all contracted today. There are 9 wells that have been drilled, they are awaiting completion, they're waiting on fracs. And importantly, 2 of those wells are first Wolfcamp A test. In fact, the first frac -- the first well being frac-ed began on Monday. The second will be done in midmonth. And so, accordingly, by the time the next call occurs, we should have a lot of interesting data on Wolfcamp A as well.","The important note regarding drilling cost is that we are trying to move to more of a development drilling campaign. Of course, we've been spending a lot of money on the early wells for science and data. But we're drilling our first 2 development wells, focusing on trying to get the well cost in that range of about $7 million. I think we can do that. One of the changes that we're in the process of implementing is increasing utilization of our Brady Brown sand from Premier Silica. That's our sand company. Today, we pump about 50% white sand, 50% resin-coated sand. Our goal, as we move forward, is to move to about 85% Brady Brown sand, and that can save us $1 million per well. So this is an important thing to be testing immediately, and that's exactly what we're doing.","As Scott had mentioned earlier, we also -- we'll be marching forward in delineating the northern acreage, drilling some wells in Midland and Martin and Gaines counties, as we get on the latter part of the year. We anticipate higher oil in plays there, deeper drilling, higher pressures and we think, as a result, more productivity going north. And of course, that will help us be able to establish the prospectivity of our acreage in terms of the total acreage package.","Recently, our team of Permian engineers did a great job in working with the Railroad Commission of Texas to adopt new field rules. It's the objective is to optimally develop the vertical and horizontal Spraberry sections. Ultimately, this will allow a development which would feature up to, perhaps more, even than 14 horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp on a section and a half, which could be coupled with as many as 41 offsetting 20-acre space verticals. And so you're looking at a field rule change that will really significantly improve recoveries and we believe will optimally develop the field.","So as you can see, we're just in the beginning in unlocking the immense value of the Horizontal Wolfcamp Acreage, and in our prospective acreage in the play. So stay tuned as we start the process of completing the rest of these wells and drill further wells.","On Slide 12, I'm now turning to, plays, the vertical deepening program, as well as the horizontal Wolfcamp shale program that's going. It's still the vertical drilling programs, specifically the deepening of wells, which has allowed us to exceed our growth targets through the first half of this year. And in fact, at this point, we are deepening about 65% of the vertical program. We had planned, this year, to be deepening only about 50%. But as good as the results have been, we're increasing the program to about 2\/3 of our campaign. The table here on Slide 12 shows 24-hour IP rates or the deepened wells, whether it be the Strawn, the Atoka or the Mississippian. And you can see, these compare very favorably when you consider that the 140,000 barrel type curve, associated with normal vertical Wolfcamp completed wells, has an IP of about 90,000 BOE per day. So you can see the impact which, I think, deepening is having in the early stages of well performance. And the table also shows the potential incremental EUR from the deepenings. Importantly, we've done some work, some further analysis, in refining of our mapping to assess the prospectivity from the deeper zones. We now believe the strong prospectivity is towards the top end of our prior range. We had used 60% to 70%, we now believe it's about 70% of the acreage. Atoka is coming in at the top end of its previous range of 25% to 50%. We now believe it's in the neighborhood of 40% to 50%, and Mississippian continues to be prospective for about 20% of the acreage. And so, the deepening really has been a excellent result for us. It's the thing that's leading us to outperform in this play. And it's the case that we can, I think, add significant EUR perhaps even up to 100,000 BOE per well, when these deep zones are co-mingled.","So, then, turning to Slide 13. This, really, is a slide which shows the effect of the successful drilling campaign and the effect of the well deepenings I just covered. You can see, we came in at 64,000 BOE a day for the quarter. That would've been 68,500 BOE a day for the quarter, other than for the well-documented NGL issues that Scott has already covered. That has led us to the increase forecast for this year's production for the Spraberry trend area, to 63,000 to 67,000 BOE per day, and that underpins the increase in the overall corporate production guidance that Scott has already covered. And we really anticipate that, although we're going to be in a situation in which we have ethane rejections through the rest this year, we think it'll be a very strong finish to the year. Permian asset base is delivering in a major way, and a lot of the production of course is due to the well deepenings.","Now turning to Eagle Ford on Slide 14. This is an asset base that continues to grow and will continue to do so. We put 37 wells on production during the quarter. We continue to have 12 rigs running and still anticipate a 125-well campaign. We have reduced, slightly, the number of dry gas wells we plan to drill, from about 15% of the program. Now it looks like we'll only drill about 10% of the program or about 12 wells, focused on holding dry gas acreage, in response to commodity prices. We continue to expand the limits of the utilization of white sand. Of course, we were using white sand in several wells already this year, 53 wells have been stimulated using white sand. Importantly, we're just using white sand for the first time, on some dry gas drilling, in order to try to cut the cost on dry gas wells, and have 4 more of those wells planned for the remainder of this year. And importantly, that's a $700,000 savings per well, and that's why it's important to test it on what would otherwise be economically challenged dry gas wells.","We're a leader when it comes to having infrastructure in place. We have added 3 more CGPs in the second quarter. That gives us 11. We have 3 more to put in next year and that will have us substantially complete in terms of our infrastructure build-out at the end of 2013, for the Eagle Ford Shale play.","Turning to Slide 15. This shows the results of the activity and the growth from the Eagle Ford Shale. We expect that growth to increase in the second half of the year and you can see that in the overall fiscal year, our full-year guidance. We're going to be putting more wells on production in the second half than we did in the first. We popped 63 wells in the first half of this year and anticipate putting 76 wells on production in the second half of the year. And that underpins the production increase in the second half of the year.","Turning to Slide 16, our third major area of Texas-based drilling is in the Barnett Shale Combo play. We drilled 12 wells in the second quarter. We did announce, as Scott mentioned, reducing our rig count by 1, from 2 rigs to 1 rig. This is in response to a combination of relatively low natural gas prices as well as the decline in NGL prices that was pretty substantial in the second quarter. We have seen some drilling results that have been very encouraging. In fact, they've been oily well results which, of course, is beneficial in today's commodity price environment. In fact, we drilled 7 recent wells that had 30-day peak rates of 345 BOE per day and we're more oily than the typical Barnett shale well. Importantly, we are still incrementally adding value by gaining substantial efficiencies in drilling. We moved our drilling times, on these Barnett Shale wells, down from about 16 days last year to about 10 days currently, and that savings is significant.","In turn, as you turn to Slide 17, production continues to grow in the Barnett Shale Combo play. We're confident in the range for the year. Of course, the rate of growth will slow as we see towards the end of the year, as see the effects of reducing the rig count from 2 down to 1. We'll be looking at, and evaluating the 2013 capital for the Barnett Shale combo play in the later part of this year as we look at the outlook for NGL prices as well as natural gas prices through the rest of this year, and looking at the expectations for next year.","Slide 18, a quick update on Alaska. Production was up in the quarter, owing to the first successful Nuiqsut well had been mechanically diverted -- frac-ed earlier this year. And that well is on for most of the quarter. We do have the 1 rig running, still, on the island. And that rig, principally, is working on drilling wells that will be the subject of 4 additional diverted fracs for the next upcoming winter season. Of course those fracs will not be done until well after the freeze. We need space for the frac lead and we put the space for frac tanks and other equipment. So we're going to need ice for space around the island, so we really won't be getting to those fracs 'til probably February.","And in addition, we are doing some planning to drill perhaps another Torok appraisal well from the shore. The idea is offsetting the excellent well we drilled last winter and evaluating the potential for the development and, in fact, spending money on the upfront FEED study as we speak. We believe, as a result of the campaign last year, we've had about 50 million BO -- barrels of oil, in terms of resource potential, in the Torok area.","Our other, principally gas-producing areas in the mid-continent and Raton, and South Texas, performed very well in the quarter despite being allocated very little capital. And the slow decline on these assets gives us a great production foundation from which we can grow and that's attributed to the people in these divisions doing an excellent job.","With that I'm going to pass over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and his outlook for next quarter.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 19. For the quarter, the company reported net loss attributable to common stockholders of $70 million or $0.57 per diluted share. That did include unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains of $61 million or $0.49 per diluted share, and unusual items representing net charges of $229 million or $1.84.  So, adjusting for those items, most of which was noncash related to Barnett Shale impairment-related legacy dry gas properties, resulted in a $98 million, as Scott mentioned, of adjusted income or $0.78 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of Slide 19, production, Scott and Tim both discussed I'm not going to talk anymore about that. If you look at the other items here, relative to our second quarter guidance, they were either within guidance or at -- on the positive side of guidance. Another good quarter for the company.","Turning to Slide 20 and looking at price realizations. As Scott mentioned, we did put out, middle of July, our production and price realizations for the quarter. Here, as you can see, looking at oil, realized prices were down 12% from the first quarter, at $86.87. NGL prices were impacted pretty substantially due to lower ethane and propane prices, and they were down 22% from the first quarter, at $32.62 per barrel. And then, looking at gas, we're down 20% to $2 from $2.51 in the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 21. Production cost came in, for quarter, at $14.70 per BOE. That was a 7% increase from the first quarter. Couple of items that are enumerated here. Increased work-over activity during the quarter, just the timing of when that activity took place. We have seen some minimal cost inflation on labor and salt water disposal cost. That hit us in the second quarter as well. And then, it's small, there at the bottom of the pie -- or the bar, the net gas processing. Margins were down, we processed third-party gas through our facilities where we have excess capacity and we get paid, generally, for that with percentage of proceeds and with lower gas and NGL prices, that affected our margins. And then lastly, when you look at production cost on a BOE basis, the ethane rejection reduced our production or the denominator in the calculation, and so that impacted production cost by $0.19 per BOE for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 22. Third quarter guidance. Production guidance of 155,000 to 159,000 BOEs per day for the third quarter. That does reflect continued ethane rejection throughout the quarter. Our production cost at $13.50 to $15.50 per BOE. Exploration and abandonment $25 million to $40 million, and that's down slightly. It was just less exploration drilling activity, and seismic activity in the second half. And then the other items are consistent with previous guidance other than, interest expense reflects the bond offering that Scott talked about earlier. And then other expense reflects additional rig termination fees.","So with that, why don't we stop there and we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes. On the 5 Wolfcamp wells. It's just interesting that the University wells are all sort of completed in close proximity, but the IPs were different. And I understand there's some variability to be expected. But when you guys look geologically, is there any difference in terms of the lithology or the rock as you moved across that southern acreage position where you drilled?","Timothy L. Dove","No. We really don't see too much. There is a combination, I think, and Tim mentioned it. That you got 1 well on jet pump several on gas lift and we're learning that, flowing back the wells, up on the casing is probably the best process going forward. So that's why you get different variance of rates. And so, we're going, almost all of our the wells now, we're going to start flowing back for several weeks to months, to established low decline and get the best performance. So we just don't see much change to that. We think, as you move, maybe toward our Rocker B, we may get a little bit more gas. But, so far, our gas ratios are staying 1,000 or under, and even as we move south. Now as we move southeast, more toward EOG and approach, we anticipate maybe a little bit more gas and NGLs. We don't know that yet.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And on the University wells, the 4 50-ish IP wells that were put on artificial lift early. I think, Scott, you're saying that you might not do that in the future, and that could be the reason why the wells were lower rate than, say, some of the other offsets that are on natural swell?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, that's right. In fact, the best University well has been flowing back, and Tim mentioned it, and it's the process that we usually [indiscernible] also, and that's why it's got a higher 30-day rate, because we're flowing it back. So the goal is to flow it back up 5.5-inch casing versus -- the Giddings wells will actually flowed back. They were restricted. They were flowing back under tubing. So we think that the flow back is the best procedure right now and we're going to do that going forward for a while.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Matt, I guess that support the idea, that you'll see flatter declines on some of the wells, especially once you put on artificial lift on early?","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just on that, the overall acreage, is there any way that you guys could segment it, maybe between the 3 different areas? Sort of the southern, the mid and then the northern, that you've untested. Just kind of give some sense of what you guys think you've de-risked at this point.","Richard P. Dealy","To the north, as you recall, the only well we drilled to the north has been a Cline well in the D zone, in Midland County. In fact, that well has become very flat and it's getting and better. We only frac-ed -- it was only that well at a 3,800-foot lateral. And so, we're becoming, obviously, more optimistic in the Cline, through Midland and Martin County, but we're still going to be focusing on the A and B zone. But with the database of 70,000 logs and core data, our map show that -- been some of the other activity to the North and Davin had a pretty good in Ector County, just offset due west of Midland County. And then you got all the activity in Glasscock County, has given our confidence that presented market are going to be as good or better than Upton and Reagan.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's fantastic. And then the last question for me is just, looking at the Davin JV that was announced this morning, which was effectively $70, $200 or so, in acre. As you guys compare the results on that eastern edge of the play versus where your wells and where you're look to JV in southern Wolfcamp area. Would your expectations be at least that much, from a per acre-type map analysis?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. I think, their acreage -- first of all, their acreage is more exploratory in general. They have some of it on the Eastern where there's been some pretty good Cline wells. But a lot of it moves further east into the eastern shelf. They, probably, are more limited to, potentially, 1 zone, where we have potential for up to 4 to 5 laterals in each of our -- you've got 1 in the A, you may have up to 2 in the B, because it's about 500 feet thick. You'll have some in the C and then you'll have some in the D or the Cline. So, our acreage, I think, is obviously a lot more proven. Has a lot more upside. So, obviously, should demand a much, much higher price.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","With the 575 MBOE EUR that you put out here on the Wolfcamp, are you signaling that the 5 wells that you released here are 525 MBOE EURs or is that coming average of the Giddings wells and these wells or how should we think about that?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, Cameron, the way you should look at it is this, the 575,000 BOE type curve or EUR, is reflective of 7,000-foot laterals. So if you take a look at these wells in the table, on Slide 10, you'll notice they're anywhere between 5,700 feet and 6,500 stimulated lateral lengths. So these would be slightly less than 575,000 when we equilabrate [ph] or adjust the wells as if they were 7,000-foot laterals, you'll get 575,000. These will just simply be an average, it'll be slightly lower than that, based on their lateral length.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And just in terms of the JV, have you guys already started discussions there or what's the timetable that we can expect?","Scott D. Sheffield","I said, earlier, that the data room will open in September, and bids will be due by the end of the year and then closing some time in the first quarter.","Operator","Next we'll go to Will Green with Stephens.","Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the additional color on the Wolfcamp. Maybe you guys could help us on what you expect on a 30 day rate, what you expect on a first year decline for that 575,000 MBOE-type curve.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I think it's best at some point in time. We're getting ready going to bring on several more wells. We'll actually come out as we move more toward the flow back procedure versus gas lift or jet pump. We'll be coming out with a type curve to give you that data.","John C. Nelson - Macquarie Research","Okay. Great, I'll look for that. And then you noted that you guys are going to be targeting the Wolfcamp A pretty soon. What's the timetable on going into the C bench?","Scott D. Sheffield","Right now, we're focused on a -- besides the A and the B, we're going to be focusing on the lower B. We think it's going to take 2 wells into the B, based on its thickness. And then, eventually we'll be moving into the C and also the Cline. So like I said, in some areas in that southern acreage, you can have 5 horizontals in regard to that area. But, what we call the lower B will be next after the A, and then moving into the C and the D over the next few months.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question here, on the potential JV. Just wanted to see if anything has kind of changed, philosophically, in you all's minds. I know, for a while, you guys had kind of said that JV is likely off the table. You guys are saying that your southern Wolfcamp acreage is going to be held by year end '13. It looks like, though, you've got the funding, at this point, to drill it up, pull it yourself. I know you talked about NEB acceleration as a result of JV, but has anything else kind of philosophically changed to want to cause you guys to JV as opposed to your thinking similarly or not you want to do that?","Scott D. Sheffield","When asked the question, Leo, over the last year, we've always been open about a potential JV as a source of funds. And we're getting more confident that this entire Wolfcamp play, and our entire position[ph], could be very profitable. And the primary reason, the JV, is that it allows us to accelerate the development of that 200,000 acres, and have somebody else cover our capital for the next 3 or 4 years. And at the end of the 3 or 4 years, we have enough cash flow to develop that. In fact, in this opportunity, the rig count gets up about 20 rigs. Just the 200,000 acres gets over 200,000 barrels a day equivalent. So it's a $25 billion investment for a total of us and a joint venture partner for the next several years. Tremendous growth. So it allows us to accelerate that and shift capital to the North where we own 100%, in Midland and Martin and Gaines Counties. That's the primary driver. And we're in a little bit lower oil price environment too.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay got you. Just a question on the EURs, the Southern Wolfcamp, you talked about the 575,000. I know you all said you come out your type curve next quarter. It looks like you got 5 new wells, I guess, a little bit more in 30 days of production history. It just -- it feels a little bit early to kind of come out with the big increase on the 5 wells. What else are you looking at, in those 5 wells, to get to the 575,000 EUR?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, there's a total of over -- you got 40 rigs running, there's a total of 400 wells producing, so there is lots of data. We've got 70,000 logs, lots of core data, so we got the confidence. A lot of other operators are drilling around us. We just feel like we have the confidence. There's other oil shales, like the Eagle Ford oil shale. We're also using the -- there's a good 3 years of results there, in the oil shale opportunity. So it's a combination of all those factors.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay got you. In terms of your slide deck, obviously, you've got a lot of info in there. I think you made a comment, in the slide, that your 2013, 2014 production guidance is kind of wait-and-see at this point. Is that purely just a function of what commodity prices might do in the next couple of years?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we said commodity prices and service costs. It's a question of whether or not we use a $80 price deck, $85 price deck or a $90 or a $100. So it really depends on -- and that's more dependent upon on -- less in the oil and gas industry but what happens in Europe and the rest of the world. So we have to come up with a long-term price case and then we'll come out -- under almost all those cases, we're going to have double-digit growth for several years, 5 to 10 years. It's just a question of how high we can push the growth number, which is very dependent upon the price of oil.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And last question, on just capital cost. You kept your drilling budget at $2.4 billion, reducing activity a little bit. Can you just give us a little bit of color around where you might have seen a little cost creep to kind of maintain that $2.4 billion despite the lower activity?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we're seeing some creep laid out in a couple of areas, and they've actually been well-documented. One is in Duar [ph], where we have been subject, at least, to some cost increases, really, throughout this year and it probably led to about, I don't know, $25 million run rate annual increase in Duar [ph], costs that we've seen over the last couple of quarters. The other thing that comes to mind is -- of course, in the Midland basin where you have -- and, actually, the whole Permian Basin, you have 540 rigs running. The number of people required to get that done is incredible, and as a result, labor cost have gone up, probably about 10% this year. I'd say those are by far and away the biggest issues when it comes inflation. The rest of the cost have been generally pretty flat this year. The other I'd just say, just to make it clear is, we have done scope changes in some of our areas. As you know, we're deepening the wells in the Permian Basin, the vertical wells, and we're actually increasing lateral lengths in some areas compared to the original plan. So some of it's scope as well, not just inflation.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, just one more, on the JV. In terms of the structure of it, how do you guys think about it from a cash versus carry perspective? Do you have a preference for how you receive capital associated with that JV?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. It'll be very -- we anticipate it'll be very similar to the Reliance structure.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then switching over to NGLs and NGL realizations. As we look at the hedges, you guys put in place for 3Q and 4Q, at over $60 a barrel of oil equivalent versus the current market, that seems like it's in kind of a $30 range. Can you talk about how you're were able to secure those or if that's relative to just a certain portion of the NGL chain, maybe the higher portion C5, et cetera?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, those volumes that we added were mainly on the heavier part of the stream, and so that's why you see the higher realized prices. And then we also had some propane ones that were tied to WTI. So it's really a combination of the heavier stream and then propane that we did a while back, then tied it to WTI so we're getting a higher realization. 6% [ph]  Of WTI.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then when you talk about the NGL inventory that you compiled. Again, is that segmented to a certain part of the NGL chain? I would imagine probably the higher portion of the chain.","Timothy L. Dove","No, those are just Permian NGL barrels, so they end up being 35% ethane and probably about 20% propane and 20% butane and about 20% natural gasoline. So it's sort of the typical Permian Basin NGL barrel.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Last one, looking at your decision to monetize your hedges on gas at '14 and a portion of them in '15. Was that more opportunistic as far as aggregating capital or are you, in some respects, also maybe calling a bottom on where you see natural gas prices in '14 and '15?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's a combination of both. Optimistic, at the same time preserving or maintaining our strong balance sheet.","Operator","Next we'll go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When you talk about accelerating drilling on the back of the JV and the Wolfcamp, can you talk to what kind of acceleration that could be? And then you may have mentioned, and it's not entirely a question, 20 rigs in the southern acreage. But where do you see your horizontal rig count going, in south plus north, with the successful JV?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. I've mentioned, Brian, that over time, we do have the opportunity to get up to 20 horizontal rigs. It's spending within cash flow over the next several years. The number of rigs that we move to the north, we haven't determined yet. Right now, it's just 1 rig. Depending on the results in Midland and Martin County and which is really going to be tied to service cost, the Monty prices. Going into the next 2 or 3 years will be determining factor. In addition, it's important that we live within cash flow as a company. And so, that'll be the primary determining factor in the out years, so how much we devote to those northern counties where we own 100%.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then you don't need the 20 rigs, though, to hold acreage. So, from an acceleration perspective would, based on your quite bullish comments on northern potential, would you not ultimately want a higher rig count in the north than you would in the south?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, a lot of it depends on infrastructure ability to -- our people, too. But I said, the determining factor, the joint venture design and the rig count, is to live within cash flow. From our standpoint. So the 20 rigs allow growth -- significant growth for several years. We'll be running those 20 rigs and the determining factor after that, going up north, is our results, living within cash flow as a company and what the commodity prices are. So it's a combination of all 3, so I can't really predict how many rigs we're going to be running in the middle of the Martin County and the horizontal at this point in time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, at the time you issued equity last year and accelerated spending in the Wolfcamp Shale southern region to hold your acreage, you had indicated there were multiple other levers that you could pull out that [indiscernible], some of which you've done. South Africa selling this JV. You'd also mentioned selling Alaska, potentially dropping down assets to the MLP. Can you talk about where you stand on some of these other remaining levers? And should a successful JV put to rest any chance of equity issuance through the end of 2013?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, first of all, the JV is one of the cheapest cost of capital. It's obviously another reason why we're pursuing that. But, in addition, we look at -- all of our assets are for sale for the right price. And so we will continue to look at the performance of those assets and make that determination, in the future, whether or not we should be selling an asset or not.","Scott D. Sheffield","Equity, yes. We have no plans, at all, to be issuing equity. Obviously, with the opportunity to do the joint venture by far exceeds the best way to drive the performance and bring forward the opportunities in the southern acreage versus issuing equity. We're very surprised about the comments that our IR department has heard, about us issuing equity, and the last thing we're going to do is issuing equity. We just issued last December. We do not want to be considered, like some people are, continued issuers in common equity.","Operator","Going next to Brian Corales with Howard Weil.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Just looking forward, do you expect -- I mean, should we think about even lower vertical rigs, say 2013, '14, and as the increase towards outer rigs in the Permian continue?","Scott D. Sheffield","That's always a possibility. If we get the type of returns like we have in Giddings. And as we move into the north acreage, then the returns from the horizontal Wolfcamp will probably most likely exceed the vertical. We'll just have to determine, at that point in time, is it better to run more horizontal rigs and less verticals or a combination of both. It's just something we'll just have to wait and see. It's probably a decision a good year from now.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And as you kind of get up north, you say, into Midland and Martin, Glasscock Counties is there any concern that you'll have from previously vertically drilled wells or none of them really reached the Wolfcamp? Or minimal reached the Wolfcamp? How should we think about that?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think, the important message is that the -- from a vertical well, when we frac the Wolfcamp, it drains around 3 to 4 acres. So it essentially has no effect on us putting a horizontal well, or a series of horizontal wells, into the Wolfcamp. Just the fact that it's so tight and we're just not exposing much of the drainage area with a vertical well.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and just one more general question. In the Wolfcamp, how much thicker is the entire Wolfcamp section in the heart of the Spraberry trend, like in Midland County versus the southern acreage?","Scott D. Sheffield","Throughout our entire acreage position, it runs from 1,500 feet to 2,600 feet. So it does vary.","Operator","Going next to Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A majority of my questions have been answered. But are you guys still thinking, in the northern portion of your acreage, it's still roughly 200,000 net acres, prospective, for the horizontal Wolfcamp or has that grown at all?","Scott D. Sheffield","No. Tim mentioned that we are going to be drilling wells in Midland and Martin and Gaines. So that will be our entire position, somewhere between 800,000 and 900,000 acres.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And then, also with the JV. If you guys are able to coin and close that in the first quarter next year -- I know, in a couple of your recent presentations, you've laid out kind of your midstream plans. Do you have the midstream lined up to support such a -- the ramp up you could be targeting with the JV on the production side?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Mario. Of course, we're planning ahead in terms of this increase ramp up and drilling and activity, and we have participated in some firm transportation deals on oil pipelines to make sure can move the volume associated with that drilling. And most of those projects come along in 2013, about the same time that we would anticipate having the beginning points of increased production, and so that's in good hands. I think we've got expansion space on -- our NGL offtake becomes in place in early 2013. We're also expanding our own Midkiff\/Benedum gas plants, from 260 million cubic feet a day to 460 million cubic feet a day by the end of next year. And the sum total of all those we think will -- best we can, avoid any kind of short term bottlenecks. Of course, we're still seeing a bottleneck in Mont Belvieu, pertaining to the NGLs and ethane rejection we mentioned. But we anticipate that would be likely done and really not an issue after the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Going back to your guide-up for 2012, it looks like that's really being driven by the Spraberry volumes. And so, I'm curious, is that going to make the kind of incremental volumes in that guide-up more oily than the overall mix?","Timothy L. Dove","I think so. I mean, as you know, Charles, we drill those Spraberry wells -- they're vertical wells. Particularly in the early part of their life, they're making 80%-plus crude oil. So that's higher than our current production mix and so, by definition, it'll increase our oil mix for the second half of the year.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.","Got it. And then, I guess, following up on that, for the missing volumes that you guys are going to have with ethane rejection. Is that going to -- you'd also expect that to increase your gas realizations per Mcf. Is that something that we should expect going forward?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. Really, I mean, if you take a look at it, it's relatively small impact, is the answer.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.","Got it. And then 2 other quick ones for me. First, Tim, when you mentioned that those XBC Giddings Estate wells are still exceeding expectations. You're referring to that new kind of 650,000 EUR expectation?","Scott D. Sheffield","Well, I'm really referring to the fact that the results of the wells, from a production standpoint of it, have been phenomenal and 7x that of a typical 140,000 vertical well. And they exhibited tremendously flat production compared to what you would expect. And as I mentioned in the call, in my slide, they're producing, on average, 365,000 BOE per day, still, which is unheard of, I guess, in the Permian Basin, in recent history. The EURs of those wells at 650,000 BOE estimate, really, is more reflective of the fact they have only 5,300-foot stimulated lateral sections. So you're going to think much, prorate up by virtue of a 7,000-foot lateral or higher. The EUR impact of that in the same area would be substantially higher than 650,000.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.","Got it, got it. And then the last question. There's been a lot of talk about some of the cost inflation on the service side, but this is more of kind of an impressionary judgment call on your part. How much do you think that your drilling efficiencies have offset that cost inflation, in terms of kind of overall efficiency of your CapEx budget?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we're seeing, as I mentioned also, earlier, seeing pretty dramatic increases in efficiencies of the drilling in combination of Barnett Shale -- Permian Basin, of course, we're experienced, and have a lot of rigs running so we're just flatline in terms of already having driven out most of the cost. We're definitely improving in the Eagle Ford shale, in terms of time and cost on wells. The one thing to note is, our vertical integration is saving tremendous amount of money right now. A combination of Pioneer pumping services and our well services. In fact, they are saving capital at a basis of second quarter run rate of over $270 million a year. So that's really where we're getting the cost advantage, is the fact that vertical integration is paying off handsomely.","Operator","Our next question will come Sven Del Pozzo with IHS Herold.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","I believe Tim mentioned something about field rules. I think you said 14 horizontals per section. Am I right? Did I hear that correctly?","Timothy L. Dove","I think it's -- we could drill a minimum of 14. 14 would be in contemplation of drilling an A and a B bench well in a section and a half, that we'd be able to drill a total of 14 of those. But to the extent we were drill C or D bench wells, we can actually increase that. Of course, this is 960 acres, so the total well count would be limited to 48 wells, based on 20 acres spacing. But we could drill a substantial number of more horizontal wells based on the fact -- as long as they're in map view, relatively close to each other, they only count as 1 location. So it's plausible you could drill, for instance, 28 horizontal wells and still drill 41 vertical wells in a section and a half. So this field rule change gives us a lot of latitude in terms of being able to optimally develop this field, considering you could be looking at numerous stack laterals and then you could offset those with either existing or offset 20s. So you're looking at a substantial amount of capital to develop what would only be a section and a half in those scenarios.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay, so you'd probably be more inclined, after you hold your acreage, to develop more densely, I guess, drill more wells in a fore-given service area and because there's probably sweet spots that you're going to discover.","Timothy L. Dove","I think that's very plausible. Probably will not occur until 2014, when we finish the acreage gather, if you want to call it that. But it's something we're contemplating now.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And I think it was, yes, Slide 12, with the vertical Spraberry type curves and the average 24-hour IP rates shown there. What should we think about in terms of dewatering times associated with these wells for the frac water to come back, and also any formation water, when we're doing our modeling? Or are we to just supposed to say, okay, day 1, 24 hour IP rate and plug in your number?","Timothy L. Dove","No, these wells pretty much come on production when we turn the pump, and basically -- of course, you're reducing a large amount of water with that. But in the Spraberry trend area, these vertical wells, we're producing water through the life of the well. It's different in the Wolfcamp where there's not a lot of water in situ. So, in this case, Spraberry trend area, we're producing 250,000 barrels of water, everyday, from these vertical wells. And so it's not exactly the same case as when you're thinking about horizontal as compared to vertical.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And then the verticals for -- how about for the Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian? Would you characterize the formation water, in those formations, similar to what you said about the Spraberry trend or more like the Wolfcamp where there's not as much?","Timothy L. Dove","Much more like the Spraberry trend area.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And then just to quantify. How many Spraberry vertical wells were completed in the first quarter and in the second quarter? And perhaps what you're on pace for in the third quarter and then that'll be it.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we put 188 wells on production in the second quarter. I don't have the number from the first quarter off the top of my head, but we're still in -- sort of heading towards 650 or so, 650 to 700 wells for this year.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And that includes the wells that were held over from 2011? The ones that you've completed in the first quarter?","Timothy L. Dove","These are wells we put on production in the second quarter.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And 650, for the year, also includes the stuff that was drilled but not completed in the fourth quarter of 2011?","Timothy L. Dove","It's pretty much just a run rate number. You look at it in terms of wells put on production or drilled. We always have an inventory of wells that are waiting on completion and waiting to be put on production, so those numbers end up equating.","Operator","Our next question will be from Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to ask a couple more, I guess -- not to beat a dead horse, but I'm thinking about 2013, I think previously you had indicated -- get into 10 net horizontal rigs or operating 10 horizontal rigs in '13. Is that still a fair assumption on a net basis, post-JV? How should we think about that?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Right now, we are -- without a JV, we're planning going to 7, start off the first part of the year. With a JV, it'll more likely be around closer to 10.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is that net or a gross operated number?","Scott D. Sheffield","That's a gross number.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And is there any willingness to outspend in '13, a modest amount, given that you're growing debt capacity and you can still drive leverage metrics lower with the growth you're seeing? Or is the mantra literally spot-on with cash flow, it's going to be the target coming end of the year?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, our long-term strategy is to grow within cash flow.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, last one on my end. Just thinking about kind of targeted lateral length. Is that 7,000 the current assumption or there --  is it likely to be a little lower than that, just based on field limitations?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think the objective is to, at a minimum, drill 7,000-foot laterals because there's, clearly, a very close correlation between lateral lengths and well productivity, EUR. But as I mentioned in the call, we're going to be exploring the use of up to 9,000-foot laterals in the second half of this year. So we'll have more to report as more time goes by, as to this correlation. And, of course, your lease configuration ends up being a determinant. To the extent you can actually drill more than 7,000 feet, it takes the least configuration to do so. So it certainly won't be in every case we could exceed 7,000 acres. But the objective of the field rule change is to, in fact, provide for the opportunity to drill, at a minimum, 7,000-foot wells.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So that's a fair number for '13, to kind of think about as an average?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, that's going to be above 7,000. In other words 7,000 would be the minimum. To the extent you drill some that are above that, you would exceed 7,000 on average.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at those 5 University wells. I mean, you had frac stages of like, I guess, 35 on average. The type curve you're seeing is 30 to 35 frac stages. Help me kind of think about how you've got shorter laterals but the same amount of frac stages. How's that really impact, then, the EUR assumption? Is it just overly stimulated, if you will -- or, I mean, I guess can you help bridge that a little bit?","Timothy L. Dove","There's a distinction in between the number of stages pump, and actually, the number of clusters in each stage. And so, to the extent you -- extend the laterals, you could still be running 30 to 35  stages, but you would be increasing the number of clusters in each of the stages. So, actually, you're putting more profit and more fluid away, in connection with basically increasing the number of cluster per stage.","Operator","We'll hear next from Richard Tullis with Capital One Southcoast.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly. What were the choke sizes? The typical choke you were using for the 24-hour and 30-day rates for those University wells in the Wolfcamp?.","Unknown Executive","Well, the average -- 20\/64th.","Timothy L. Dove","20\/64th, sorry, is the answer.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Tim, where would you likely test those 9,000-foot laterals on the Wolfcamp? What part of your acreage?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, specifically, I'm talking about the southern part of the acreage. Probably in the boxed areas on Slide 10. That is in Upton and Reagan, and perhaps over into Irion as well. Basically, it'll be a smattering of those wells, depending upon where we have the proper lease configuration.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, I guess you picked up a little more acreage in the Barnett Combo, in the quarter. But given the drop in activity there, and I guess the cash demands and better returns elsewhere, is any potential to look at monetizing that asset at some point?","Scott D. Sheffield","As I had stated earlier, all of our assets are up for sale. And we will determine, over time, if we get the right price, what to do. So right now, there is no current plans.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","One quick follow-up. You obviously have your plate pretty full here, with the Wolfcamp. But I know you had some plans to horizontally test the Strawn, potentially the Atoka and the Jo Mill horizon. Still planning to do those tests?","Scott D. Sheffield","We have, actually, a couple of horizontal Jo Mill wells that have been drilled. We're waiting on completion of those wells, so we'll have something to say about that, perhaps next quarter. In terms of horizontal Atoka, it's something that we're looking at for later in the year or perhaps early next year. So, we're still some time off before we'll be able to report on results from that activity.","Operator","And our last question for today will come from Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I got kind of a high-level strategic question for you. It might be a few years premature. But if you're right and the Wolfcamp plays' perspective. From north to south, across your 900,000 acres. And you can target up to 5 zones within the Wolfcamp. Your inventory and your capital intensity is just going to be mind-boggling, quite frankly. You commented that you won't outspend cash flow or issue equity here, but I'm wondering, going forward, how you're going to approach, attempting to really pull the present value forward from the site, that 100,000 acres there.","Scott D. Sheffield","We look out about 5 years. I mean, 5 to 7 years, and so, I'm not really concerned. We are pulling it forward by doing a joint venture. I mean, 5, 7 years from now, if it turns out that the Wolfcamp is 5 billion to 10 billion barrels itself, then you have lots of choices at that point in time. You can do more joint ventures, you can sell other assets in the company to fund it. It depends on what commodity prices are doing, so it's a nice problem to have. So We're focused on the next 5 to 7 years, where we're going to get significant growth and us keeping the northern acreage, and a joint venture in the southern acreage. And so, it'll be something left for future generations around here.","Operator","And we actually did have one more participant queue up with the questions. Our final question will come from Abhishek Sinha with Bank of America.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask one question on Alaska. So what plans do you have on Alaska, in terms of Devon's share? I mean, where do we stand, now, with -- since we're talking more on the JV right there.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, on Alaska, with our two recent strong results this past winter campaign. We were getting prepared to drill a second Torok well onshore next winter. And then, secondly, we have a series of frac candidates in the Nuiqsut to perform. So we're looking forward to the next winter's campaign.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. So do I read that Devon's share is still on the table or you're not talking about Devon's share anytime soon? Or...","Scott D. Sheffield","No, I think it's important for us to sit there and -- we have a lot of upside. We need to understand that potential upside before we make any long-term decisions.","Operator","And with that, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to our presenters for any final and closing remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again, we thank -- I know a lot of questions about the Wolfcamp and the joint venture. We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you all today. Look forward to the next quarter and continue to update on this tremendous resource potential in the Permian Basin. Again, thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's call.

At the website, select Investors, then select Earnings & Webcasts. This call is being recorded.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal Shah","Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be up first. He will discuss our strong third quarter results driven by solid execution from the Pioneer team. After Scott concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance optimized for rate of return while delivering best-in-class oil production.","Rich will then update you on the benefits of our downstream planning for both oil and gas. Scott will then return to discuss Pioneer\u2019s focus on sustainable practices and our commitment to social and governance issues. After that we will open up the call for your questions. Thank you. So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Neal. Good morning. First of all, I want to thank all of our employees and our management team for really three great quarters and especially for achieving $250 million in free cash flow in the third quarter in just a short very, very short time frame. We\u2019re reducing the top end of our full-year guidance again by additional $150 million, we're increasing our full-year production guidance by 3% at the midpoint, continued to see positive benefits for exporting of our crude oil, $46 million in the quarter, uplift a total for $279 million for the year.","Also, as you notice, we're starting to put in some ESG slides. And we are reducing of those 2016 to 2018 time period, we got a 38% reduction in our total greenhouse gas emissions intensity. We'll talk more about that later. Again focused on free cash flow yield and return on capital employed.","Going to Slide number 4, again, a very, very solid execution is driving our third quarter results. Again, production at the top end of the guidance also significantly improved capital efficiency coming through quarter by quarter by quarter.","Going to Slide number 5, again continue to improve capital efficiency. Again, we're the top end of the DC&F growing completion facilities ranked being reduced again by additional $150 million approximately 5%. We did achieve $100 million in facility savings already ahead of schedule. If you remember, it was a goal to achieve for the year 2020. We achieved it in a very, very short timeframe due to the focus of our production people.","Continued improvements in D&C efficiencies, as we're seeing again increasing the midpoint of production guidance by 3% on BOEs again, stronger BOE growth attributable to increased NGL yields from addition of two new gas plants we\u2019re going up from about 135 barrels per million to about 155 barrels per million on those plants.","Going to Slide number 6, the 2019 outlook again lowering top end of guidance, DC&F to about $2.85 billion. Again, our D&C teams are continuing to execute every quarter at a very, very high level.","We're updating our 2019 average rig guidance to about 21. And that does include adding one rig that's already started in early November. Expecting to pop about 290 wells towards the upper end by original guidance up to 265 to 290.","Regarding our Midstream and DrillCo initiatives, there's really nothing new to report for the quarter. We're still in the process stage. We will update you once we have more information.","On Slide number 7, again the priorities are aligned with shareholders, continue to buy back stock in the quarter roughly about $200 million at an average price about $1.25. We bought back about 3% of their shares year-to-date, when you include the production growth of mid-teens, results in our annualized dividend results in about a 20% shareholder return, still tend to increase the dividend over time to be competitive with that of the S&P 500 yield.","Slide number 8, again, the competitive advantage of the Midland Basin over the Delaware basin. Again, I think the main change we made from the last quarter, we've had a lot of questions about how much federal acreage do you have in the Midland Basin and the answer is zero. So regardless of who gets elected, and this next election, Pioneer essentially has no risk. We have no infrastructure risk, as all of our lines will move from the Midland Basin to the Gulf Coast within Texas.","I won't go over the other comparisons because they've been repeated since last quarter. Slide number 9, again really no change. Again, we're focused on return on capital employed. Looks like it'll continue to move up for 2019 and over the next several years, we're still focused on mid-teen, moving it up to the mid-teens range and a $55 WTI environment.","Slide number 10. This is a new slide again showing percent of acreage developed is coming out of the Wells Fargo group with our peer group, and showing the acreage quality years of inventory breakeven price less than $50 WTI. You can see Pioneer is best to be far right and toward the bottom obviously.","In addition, we probably have probably some of the highest working interest and probably some of the lowest royalty burden obviously allows us to achieve much better economics on all of our drilling activity.","I'll now turn it over to Joey Hall to go over operations.","Joey Hall","Thanks, Scott and good morning to everybody. I'll be taking over on Slide 11. Still seeing great results in the Wolfcamp D appraisal program. Our approach to delineation combined with our completion optimization is resulting at approximately 100% improvement in Wolfcamp D performance from the 12 wells drilled since 2017. As Scott mentioned earlier, we are adding a rig in November to set up for 2020 program and our operations team was able to fully accelerate the $100 million in annualized facility savings through value engineering and optimization.","Moving now to Slide 12, simply reiterating our approach to address market concerns regarding the negative consequences of tight spacing. Our large acreage position allows us to prioritize returns and we do not down space to artificially increase our inventory and risk negative parent-child impacts. Our development approach in conjunction with completion optimization has allowed our well productivity to improve year-over-year.","And now on Slide 13, starting on the left, once you normalize gross production for all peers on a two stream basis, Pioneer has the highest oil percentage. And then looking over on the right, we also have the best 12-month cumulative oil production. These two facts combined should lead to the best margins and the highest returns in the basin over time. I'd like to add my congratulations to our subsurface drilling completions and operations teams for an excellent quarter on all fronts. And I'll now turn it over to Rich.","Rich Dealy","Thanks, Joey and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 14, where you can see the bar chart that shows that we are generating peer-leading EBITDA margins per BOE. And as you can imagine, that's the foundation for generating free cash flow and strong corporate returns and really is what allows us to be able to return capital to shareholders. The second thing that I think it highlights is the benefits of us moving our oil and gas out of the Permian Basin to higher priced markets. And that\u2019s combined with our cost reduction efforts this year is really leading to great margins.","These will improve further relative to the peers. This does not reflect the benefits that we've seen from our G&A reduction efforts earlier this year that we're not fully realized until the third quarter. So when you combine higher margins with our strong balance sheet, it really provides significant financial flexibility as we move into 2020.","Turning to Slide 15, you can see at the upper left there, where our price realizations were $56 per barrel for the quarter. This is relative to Permian peers that would have realized $54 or so. So a $2 increase really was provided by our firm transportation to move our oil to the Gulf Coast where we realized $46 million of incremental cash flow for the quarter and $279 million year-to-date.","For the quarter, we did move about 205,000 barrels to the Gulf Coast about 75% of which was exported during the quarter that is increasing to 225,000 here in November and our volumes that will transfer to the Gulf Coast. If you look at the fourth quarter what's happened with narrowing differentials and shipping costs have been higher due to the tanker sanctions have a limited availability of ships, so we are forecasting a nominal to slightly positive cash flow impact in the fourth quarter.","And then the other thing I'd point out is that, similar to oil, we do move our gas out of the basin and with Gulf Coast Express coming on, we're moving about $300 million a day down to the Gulf Coast. So starting in the fourth quarter, we have about 60% of our gas will go to the Gulf Coast will be priced off Houston Ship Channel or NYMEX Indexes, and then about 40% will still move out to Arizona, California markets. They\u2019re priced off of a SoCal Index. So very minimal Waha exposure moving forward.","And then lastly, just an update on our derivative positions. For the fourth quarter, we have added incremental barrels, so we're now at 110,000 barrels a day of oil, hedged at roughly $65 Brent and for 2020 we are 80,000 barrels at roughly $63 Brent with upside from there. So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks, Rich. We will now open it up for -- oh no, I forgot. We do have our ESG slide. Sorry, I got ahead of myself. On Slide number 16, I think the key points here is that the company is focused on all three of these measures and will continue to highlight all of these measures going forward, we have a great third year in a row, we just released our ESG report, but again focused on the environmental side.","Again, we've had 40% reduction in methane intensity and a 38% reduction in Greenhouse gas emissions intensity from 2016 to 2018. One of the key things that we do, we do not connect any new horizontal wells to production unless the gas line is already in place.","I think that's something that should be adopted by oil producers in the Permian Basin. Also, we're one of the few companies that our facilities 100% of our facilities are early monitored for Leak Detection and repair. We do it through aerial flying about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. We do it once a year. Very, very important practice to determine where your methane leaks and fix those leaks as soon as possible.","Again, on the social side, we have one Pioneer, we're focused on community, culture and talent development, continued focused on improving gender diversity, continued to move this up significantly in regard to percent of women inside the oil and gas industry, inside the management teams, the board level and all employees throughout the company.","And then on the governance over the last few years, we have set up some key committees both HS&E Committee, Oversight and have a very, very strong Corporate Governance Committee.","Going to Slide number 17 gives you a better breakdown on our Greenhouse gas intensity, and methane intensity in regard to our peers. Again, it\u2019s peer-leading for 2018 data going forward already discussed the reasons why that we are taking, we are leading our peers in regard to some of our business practices out in the field.","Slide number 18 has been a very hot topic recently, over the last several months about how much flaring is going on in the Permian Basin. This data was taken by a company called Rystad out of Norway. It's already been published in the New York Times and also in several newspapers, but I think one of the best things to do everybody needs to focus on getting down to 2% or below 2% in regard to venting and flaring and we will take this off the industry.","You can see there is a lot of peers that are way above the average, everybody needs to have the same practice and focused for the same reasons that we had in regard to new wells coming on, they need to be connected to a gas line. And secondly, everybody needs to do some type of monitoring on the flaring side.","And finishing on Slide number 19. Again the company again just had three great quarters in a row and excited about going into 2020. It's all about execution, delivering free cash flow, and delivering higher return on capital employed numbers over the next several years. Again, thanks. I will now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take a question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yes, good morning, I was wondering if you could comment on what is driving the facility cost reduction efforts. I think you mentioned that through the redesign of your facilities, you're expecting CapEx to be $100 million less. So I guess my ultimate question would be how are you looking at facilities today with more of a focus on free cash flow generation, versus perhaps before when you had the million barrel target?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, Arun. It was simply and I think I've stated this publicly before is really since we have lowered our growth, the company growth rates from 20% to 25%, as they have shown the last two years to a mid-teens growth rate, it's not worth building for the next five years. So we're designing our facilities.","We're paying special attention to fill everyone that's not full. And secondly, we're making small changes in the design of the size of our facilities based on a mid-things row. So it was achieving that probably three to six months earlier, we were hoping to go into 2020. So we achieved about third quarter. So it's really achieving that three to six months earlier than I thought. So the team was focused, they did a great job. But those are the main two drivers.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And my follow-up, Scott is I'm wondering if you could provide any commentary on your plans in 2020. We did note that you added a rig in November. I think there's two scenarios that you're looking at. One was either to add a couple, two, three rigs in late in 2019 to support 2020 growth, or maybe add a couple, two or three rigs later in 2020. I think the current consensus forecast is calling for about 13% oil growth at just under $3.4. billion in CapEx. So just wanted to get your thoughts on 2020 and where consensus sits today?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, thanks Arun. As we have stated publicly, we're going to be adding on roughly about two to three rigs per year over the next several years to achieve our mid-teens growth rate. When you look at about $140 million per rig, and the rigs we add and you back out of the fact that we've already achieved facilities, we\u2019re going to have reduction in regard to both the water in the Midstream side from $300 million to a much lower number going into 2020.","That I think the street is fairly close to their numbers. We have we will be going to the board over the next, this November board meeting and then early in January and releasing in early February. But when you go through the math, it still implies a 2020 CapEx budget of roughly about $3.3 billion.","Arun Jayaram","Thanks a lot, Scott.","Operator","We will now take a question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Scott Sheffield","Hi, John.","John Freeman","Just a follow-up on the prior question. So you had previously talked about kind of averaging 21 ","to 23 rigs even with the rig add in November, which I know was previously planned, you're now targeting 21 rigs. And I'm just curious if that's just all efficiency gains, or is it a timing issue where maybe some of the additional rigs you might have added for 2020 might not happen till early next year?","Joey Hall","Hey, John, this is Joey. And you answer the question. All this is due to efficiency gains. Whenever you see a 30% improvement cycle times year-over-year, it doesn't take much to start winding down your rig count. So yes the reduction in rig numbers is purely due to efficiency gains.","John Freeman","Great. And then just my follow-up question, you've done a really good job kind of historically kind of opportunistically putting these hedges on kind of low to mid sort of 60s price for Brent. I'm just curious if just anything you're seeing on the macro side with the rig counts continuing to fall expectations for U.S. growth continuing to be sort of reduced. If that's sort of maybe changing the thinking of what levels you'd be willing to hedge that going forward?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, John. I think we still have to get through 2020 but I've been on public record talking about the Permian is going to slow down significantly over the next several years, I\u2019ve lowered my targets and my annual targets, a lot of it has to do with free cash flow to start with the free cash flow model that public independents are adopting, the issues that private equity firms are going through in regards to consolidation reducing activity, the reduction of NGL prices significantly, we've deviated long-term from about 70% to 50% of WTI.","Now we're down to 30% of WTI especially for propane and butane, all that is left revenue, the strained balance sheets lot of the companies have, the parent-child relationships that companies are having, people drilling a lot of Tier 2 acreage. So I'm probably getting much more optimistic about 2021 to 2025 now in regard to oil price.","I don't think OPEC has to worry that much more about U.S. shale growth long-term. And all that is very beneficial. So we probably going to be more careful in the years 2021 to 2025 because there's not much coming on after the three big countries that are bringing on discoveries over the next 12 months Norway, Brazil and Guyana. Guyana will continue, obviously.","But I'm definitely becoming more optimistic that we're probably at the bottom end of the cycle regarding oil price. So we're still going to hedge in 2020 to protect what may happen with China trade agreement, and other things that may happen, but we will be more cautious as we go into the 2021 to 2025 time period.","John Freeman","Thanks, Scott. I appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on the CapEx reductions. They were obviously quite impressive during the third quarter. We've seen big step downs over the course of this year from sand and pressure pumping shifts and then reduction and completion efficiencies and facility costs.","The big pieces behind you at this point do you see the potential for further gains going forward particularly on the completion efficiency side where it's been pretty impressive this year?","Joey Hall","Yes, Ryan, we certainly had a tremendous year this year from a cycle time improvement and cost reduction perspective and I would temper expectations for 2020 because we did have some huge gains particularly related to the ProPetro transaction. And again, these efficiency gains we made in big steps this year primarily but just focus on lean manufacturing methodologies. And what I tell people all the time, one of the best things that ever happens to an operations team is slowing down and being able to catch your breath and reflect and get focused on performance.","And that's what transpired during this last slowdown. So we\u2019re just able to focus on the basics and make big gains but going forward, your commentary is correct that I wouldn't expect to see huge leaps going forward but I wouldn't also suggest that we don't have room to improve.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. And you\u2019re guiding to relatively flat oil production in the fourth quarter, can you provide any maybe any high level color on cadence or trajectory of activity and volumes over the next few quarters, or at least at a high level on 2020 whether we should see a relatively consistent growth or front or back-end loaded?","Neal Shah","Hey Ryan, it's Neal. If you look at the cadence of our rigs throughout the year, we started at 24, our rig count came down throughout the year down to 18. Right now we're sitting, we exited Q3 at 18, we added the additional rig at 19. But if you look at how those rigs dropped in terms of the POP cadence from a quarterly perspective, Q4 will reflect our lowest quarter from a perspective of POPs.","So that's kind of the main driver in terms of that oil production being relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Now, as you look forward to 2020, we've yet to formalize the precise plans and the teams are still working for it. But I don't see any reason why you would see consistent growth quarter-over-quarter as we progress through 2020. But that's just really setting the framework. I think the team needs to work through their precise plans. And as you know, we'll announce that in February.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks Neal.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Nitin Kumar with Wells Fargo.","Nitin Kumar","Good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions. Scott, if you could talk a little bit ","about the M&A market. You know, you mentioned the DrillCo strategy. We just saw the Parsley Jagged Peak deal. You talked about guys running Tier 2 acreage, just kind of interested in how are you thinking about that?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, I think any type of transaction like Parsley did that consolidates acreage that is very contiguous improves the balance sheet, as accretive companies should do. There's probably not a lot of those still on record saying the majors are the most aggressive in regard to drilling activity. They will have to go up to decide whether or not to bulk up their inventory over the next two to three years and decide whether or not to acquire any independents. And so besides that, it just is not going to happen for a while, it may happen if we get into a better oil price market. So that's really about it.","Nitin Kumar","Got it. And then just going back to Slide 11 on the Wolfcamp D. Obviously gaining confidence in that zone, when should be expect it to move from appraisal into development mode?","Joey Hall","Yes, that's one of the beauties to having such a large acreage position is that you can do this appraisal and sit back and watch results from these wells and make sure long-term that you fully understand the decline curves and also look, go back and look at your costs and see if you have the opportunity to reduce costs to make them even more economic and in the meantime, we can still go back to our traditional Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B, Lower Spraberry shale and continue to develop those until we fully understand the production from the Wolfcamp D.","So what I would suggest you would see next year from an activity perspective is probably pretty similar to what you saw this year. But if you look at the Jo Mill for example, I would say I went through a similar transition that we appraised it for a while. And then we started slowly adding more Jo Mill wells into the program this year up to 7%. But Wolfcamp D was a pretty small percentage of our program this year will probably be a little smaller percentage next year, but in the out years, you'll start to see it come in after we make sure we fully understand it, and we're able to continue to put that into our program.","Nitin Kumar","Great, thanks for answering my questions.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Scott Sheffield","Hi, good morning, Jeanine.","Jeanine Wai","Good morning, following-up on Arun\u2019s question on the rig adds. Can you walk through or talk about how you're balancing the 2019 CapEx budget with perhaps trying to mitigate any operational friction with having to add maybe more rigs faster in 2020 versus a more ratable cadence or is the right way to think about it really on efficiencies meaning that with the efficiency gains that you've been achieving the historical two to three rig adds really can be biased downwards. And so therefore, kind of concerns on operational friction might be overblown for 2020?","Joey Hall","Yes, Jeanine, no, I wouldn't account that to anything related to operational friction. I would just say just like you saw the 2019 program play out. The numbers that we put out in the beginning of the year was fully what we anticipated the rig count would be but because of the efficiency gains we saw during the year we just frankly didn't need more rigs, you can even look at frac fleets, we dropped frac fleets sooner than we had expected. And whenever you look at 2020, now let's just changing the game and the amount of equipment you need to accomplish a certain amount of work just gets less and less as you continue to grow efficiencies.","So it's not related to any challenges or operational frictions, it's 100% due to the fact that we've just gotten better at drilling and better completing wells from a cycle time perspective.","Neal Shah","Jean, I'm going to piggyback on Joey's response. And if you look at where we started the year, right, we're 24 rigs with an average of 21 to 23 with POPs of 265 to 290. Right now we're sitting we're actually taking that average down to 21 rigs, but yet the POPs are going to the high-end of the range of 290. So if anything, the increased efficiencies by the great performance from the Pioneer teams has resulted, I'd say in less operational friction, which has manifested itself in our numbers and the CapEx as well as production.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning Scott to you and your team there. I wanted to ask an update.","Scott Sheffield","Yes, thanks.","Charles Meade","Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask if you could maybe give us an update on how you're thinking about your buyback pace going forward, as I look at 2020, the big differences you guys have upped your dividend meaningfully. And depending what price deck you use that that could takes up a big chunk of the free cash flow you're generating. But on the other side, you have these assets. So can you talk a little bit about how those pieces go together and if there's any sequencing related to the pace of a buyback going forward?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, we're still, we still have a $2 billion buyback, we're still evaluating it and then regard to all the pieces as we deliver free cash flow, how much goes to the balance sheet. How much goes to dividend and how much goes to the buyback?","So we'll be discussing that in our upcoming board meetings over the next several weeks. And so at that point, we think it's all important. We don't have any specific to this point in time. So we'll get back with you as we develop our plans.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thank you. And then Scott, I want to go back to one of the -- or some of your comments in your prepared remarks. I think you've made your view on the venting and flaring and what should be the industry practice? You made that pretty clear. But I'm curious do you think are you sensing a change in what's kind of socially acceptable or acceptable for the industry as a whole? In other words, is industry coming towards you or do you think you're still kind of a Pioneer in that, no pun intended, in that regard.","Scott Sheffield","Yes, no that\u2019s a good term of Pioneer. We always like to be a leader and so if I had a chance to speak in New Mexico at the First Methane Conference by the Governor Grisham out there recently spoken at Jason Bordoff\u2019s Conference last March and April and made a statement. It's a big black eye for the Permian Basin. And so we don't want to become what's happened to the Bakken over the last five years.","And so we need to do something about it. So we're taking steps internally, to do something about it. And I want every other company in the Permian Basin do the same thing. So we're leading, and we just want the people to follow us and do this take the same steps. We also need more pipeline, met gas pipelines, that's an issue I haven't been able to solve and get them in faster.","We do have two more lines coming in early 2021 going from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast, but we definitely need more gas lines and people committing to those gas lines. People don't really have to make it legal commitment of MVCs like Pioneer, so I know being on one of the big midstream companies on the board that they will work out relationships and agreements in regard to where you don't have to commit volumes but they still can take your gas.","But we just need to figure out a way to shut it down and it didn't start until 2012 when Horizontal really took off, and we just need to take it off, need to take the black eye off, especially going into the next election.","Charles Meade","Scott, thanks for those comments.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold","Yes, thanks. Hi, good morning. Could you all provide a little bit more color on the Wolfcamp D in terms of what you'd like to kind of continue to see from it to make it competitive or maybe some context on how it competes for capital in some of the other core areas?","Joey Hall","Yes, Scott, going back to what I said earlier. It is a big part of our plan going forward. But I think everybody's aware because Wolfcamp D is deeper, it is more expensive and it is little bit more challenging.","Whenever we executed these last 12 wells, there were several objectives. One was to try our completion optimization, which you can see was successful, but also intermingled in there are some spacing tests, we've done four different spacing configurations in different areas.","So it just takes time for those things to be understood. And make sure that whenever we are ready to execute, we fully understand the impact of spacing completion, optimization, and again, like I said, the cost side, we were always looking at opportunities to get the cost down.","So in essence because we have the luxury of time because of a large footprint and an ability to go and do the things that we know the best, we will just continue to optimize the solution for these and make them more and more competitive. Having said that, the Wolfcamp D wells are very strong and competitive with the rest of our portfolio, but we just want to make them better by understanding their performance.","Scott Hanold","Okay, and on the potential for maybe some improve well cost reductions, really is that just inexperienced? Or there other things that you all are trying right now to aid in that?","Joey Hall","Specifically in the Wolfcamp D?","Scott Hanold","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, specifically with the Wolfcamp D.","Joey Hall","Yes, I don't think it's any secret that whenever you're stimulating these deeper, higher pressured wells, it is more challenging. So, it does cost more, but we've seen every time that we've executed these wells that we've learned something and gotten better. But now you want to make sure that whatever adjustments you made doesn't impact performance. So those two things go hand in hand.","So we have gradually gotten better at execution, but now we just seem to understand performance and tie those two things together.","Scott Hanold","Okay, understand. Okay and then on your LOE cost, I mean power was an issue in several areas during the summer because of hot weather, what are some of the things that you\u2019re all looking at to mitigate some of that? And how much are you impacted by that generally speaking?","Rich Dealy","Definitely, Scott it impacted us during the quarter just because of the summer heat in July, August, particularly were higher. So it affects us on both the gas processing side where it takes electricity and then the field level. So, we look at that from time to time, look to hedge it, but for the most part, it's seasonal, and so we're past that time period and would expect to see them refer back to more normal rates as we move through the rest of this year.","Scott Hanold","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning, on Slides 12 and 13, you highlighted 180 and 365 day well performance and the improvement in rates over time. Well some of these slides are making a relative point versus peers? How do you see the absolute well productivity moving when you think about your 2020 program, and what is the scope and drivers of potential further improvement?","Joey Hall","I think whenever you look at the -- those lines, you can obviously see that there's closure year-over-year. So I think it's obvious that we're reaching a point in time where the opportunity to improve well performance is not what it was compared to two or three years ago.","So there's definitely a convergence there. From the perspective of continuing to improve that, we are still tweaking completion designs and cluster spacing, doing more science in regards to understanding the opportunity to reduce costs because at the end of the day, we're generating economics, not just trying to produce oil.","So we want to make sure that all the decisions that we make from a completion perspective, have a return. So we're looking at it from that perspective, as well. But like I said, looking at those curves, I don't think anybody expects that we're going to continue to see that kind of improvement year-over-year. It'll eventually flatten out until new technology, EOR or some other opportunity presents itself, all of which are things that Pioneer is looking into.","Brian Singer","And do you think that barring the technology, technological improvement that the 2020 and 2021 are up relative to 1980s, that flattening is happening now for the company?","Joey Hall","Yes, I think you\u2019d see a continuing pattern like you do that the lines are just going to converge and you'll see it flattening. I think you said it best.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks and then my follow-up, you talked earlier about the share repurchase dividends and some decisions that still need to be made in terms of the magnitude of all of that going forward beyond what's already been authorized. But I wondered what your long-term leverage targets\/acceptability acceptable level is because as was mentioned earlier, you'll have some moving pieces with asset sales. But ultimately, what do you think is the right sustainable leverage?","Rich Dealy","Yes, we still have the same leverage target at the company. Debt to cash flow of 0.75, Brian. So there's no change to that.","Brian Singer","Is it fair to say then it if asset sales or operational free cash flow push you in a $55 world below that, that there would be willingness to return more cash to shareholders to get up to the 0.75?","Rich Dealy","Say your scenario again?","Brian Singer","If we're in a $55 world i.e. or whatever you would regard as mid-cycle and you leverage either via asset sales or because of operational normal free cash flow is below 0.75, would there be willingness to continue or to add to the return of capital program to get it to 0.75?","Rich Dealy","Well, we're going to look at primarily toward, what is our free cash flow and our free cash flow and I'm debating, I'm still traveling around, we're going to go out and see all of our long shareholders again early next year. But we're trying to determine a long-term strategy of what's best between share buybacks in regard to in addition to increasing the dividend, whether or not to go to variable dividend and balance sheet.","And like I said, share buybacks and how to distribute. And so I did mention at Barclays that we have roughly approximately over the next several years about $5 billion. And so we're trying to come up with the ideal plan to disperse that in regard to all three of those. Obviously, with two-thirds of that going toward shareholder friendly measures such as buybacks and dividends. And it's all related to what the oil price deck is. So I can't give any specifics in that regard, but that's how we're thinking.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for moving to me. Just a couple of questions, guys, thank you for the time. Curious, wanting to ask around your firm transportation agreements that you have in place, getting some of that brand pricing, you had a huge uplift this year, you all had early mover advantage locking up some of that capacity. Scott what's your outlook now on how you view brand versus TI and Midland pricing? And is that an asset or contract that you might look to swap out of and release some capacity, if that arbitrage is there to perhaps bring in some cash, if there's willing participants on the other side?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, I'm going to let Rich is by expert, he knows far more about it than I do. So I'm going to let him answer this question.","Rich Dealy","Yes, good question, I would say that long-term we see the benefits of moving the oil to the Gulf Coast and being higher price markets by being exported. So I don't see a scenario at this point where trading out of those contracts would be the right thing to do.","In fact, we continue to look at our long-term trajectory and we need incremental capacity out three or four years or so. So I think something we will continue to assess. And I think if you look at the forward-curve, it\u2019s roughly $5 to $6 between Brent and WTI and Midland trades at a premium WTI today, because of the pipeline's trying to get filled up with volumes.","But long-term, I think it'll still be an advantage to have our oil on the Gulf Coast where we can sell it either into the refinery market, or export it worldwide where we've been demonstrating that we get a price uplift. So I think we're going to continue with that philosophy.","David Deckelbaum","Appreciate the color on that. And then just my last one is, I guess one of the larger future big ticket items in terms of cash proceeds in the door could be something around the water handling or water sourcing. You have with City of Midland coming online at the end of 2020. You said a decision would be made around the same time, I guess. What sort of factors are you weighing the most right now because there is going to be a very low cost source of water there. How are you thinking about whether that would fit in your portfolio or not?","Joey Hall","Meaning the City of Midland project specifically?","David Deckelbaum","Yes.","Joey Hall","Yes, certainly, the fact that we entered into it and because it is such a large contract in excess of 200,000 barrels of water coming on late next year, the early the next. That's obviously a significant part of our plans going forward. And it is a very low cost source of water.","Having said that we are looking at our water system holistically and looking at opportunities to make sure that we leverage that to the best of our abilities and more specifically in our focuses on reducing our well cost. I mean, the purpose of that water system is to ensure execution. But we want to make sure that it continues to deliver value in the City of Midland project is a big part of that.","David Deckelbaum","Thank you guys.","Operator","We will now take our last question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to, I guess, follow back up on the kind of some of the commentary around 2020 in capital and rigs. I think in response to Arun, you have confirmed the Street capital number seemed reasonable but just curious on the volume side if 15% is more what we ought to be targeting or something just shy of that, given the current environment heading into 2020?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, it's too early right now to focus on that. But long-term, we're still in that mid-teens growth rate.","Michael Hall","Okay, fair enough. And guess the other question I had was just on the cash flow side of things, just trying to kind of square with our model anyways, the cash balance at the end of the quarter was lower, which seemed to be a function of the kind of the CapEx on the statement of cash flows or the abbreviated statement of cash flows, relative to the $665 million of reported capital.","Is there something going on in that that'll reverse next quarter or kind of, can you help bridge the gap between the $895 on the abbreviated statement of cash flow versus the $665?","Rich Dealy","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s just timing. I mean, as you can imagine, as we were slowing down activity that Joey talked about during the year, those bills came in during the third quarter and we paid them. They were accrued at the end of the second quarter. So you can see our payables did drop.","So it's really just timing, there's nothing and then you would expect that given the activity level for the third quarter that would come down to match that in the fourth quarter, so I think it's really just there's nothing of consequences other than just timing.","Michael Hall","Okay. Make sense. Pretty good, thank you.","Rich Dealy","Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","Yes, go ahead.","Operator","Go ahead, Mr. Sheffield.","Scott Sheffield","Okay, sorry. Again, I want to thank everyone for participating in this quarter. Looking forward to seeing everybody next quarter. Talk to you later. Bye-bye.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17218":["Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call May  7, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Scott Sheffield - Chairman & CEO","Tim Dove - President & COO","Rich Dealy - EVP & CFO","Frank Hopkins - SVP, IR","Analysts","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","John Freeman - Raymond James","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Will Green - Stephens","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Sven Del Pozzo \u2013HIS","Operator","Welcome to Pioneer Natural Resources First Quarter Conference Call.

At the website, select Investors, then select Earnings and Webcast.","This call is being recorded, a replay of the call will be archived on the Internet site through June 1st.","The company's comments today will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and the business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Thank you Layia and good day everyone, thanks for joining us. I\u2019m going to briefly review the agenda for today\u2019s call, Scott\u2019s going to be up first. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2014, another great quarter for Pioneer and he\u2019ll then discuss our capital program for the year, our production growth forecast through 2018 and our increase in resource base which is concentrated into two of the larger shale oil plays in the US the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford shale. ","After Scott concludes his remarks Tim will review our recent horizontal drilling results in the Northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and drilling plans there for this year. He\u2019ll also comment on drilling plans in the Southern Wolfcamp joint venture area and the Eagle Ford shale, Rich will then cover the first quarter financials in more detail and he will provide earnings guidance for the second quarter and after that we will open up the call for your questions. So Scott I\u2019ll turn the call over to you.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks Frank. Good morning. Again as Frank said, another great quarter for Pioneer. First quarter adjusted income of $183 million or $1.26 per diluted share. First quarter production 172,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from continuing operations, that does reflect Alaska and Barnett share as discontinued ops. Obviously there was above the first quarter production guidance range of 166 to 171. We\u2019re up 8,000 barrels a day from fourth quarter 2013, 5% oil production was up 9% from the same quarter. The growth being driven primarily by the horizontal programs in both Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and the Eagle Ford in the full recovery of the fourth quarter weather related production for Telmex. We\u2019re continuing to have the same forecast for 2014 from continuing operations of 14% and 19% based on our $3 billion drilling capital budget. The key driver again is the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, or if you remember we\u2019re at 5 rigs a year in 2013 added 11 rigs all during the first quarter we have 16 rigs up in running, drilling mostly three-well pads. It does takes somewhere between 140 and 150 days at Seaford production from a typical three-well pad. As well we\u2019ll talk later about the big impact of second half production and with the top schedule we\u2019ll show in a few seconds. We\u2019ll be increasing our wells we\u2019re putting on production from 125 for the first half to 175 in second half, obviously that increase is primarily driven by the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp.","Slide number four, we did close the sales of Alaska subsidiary in April continue to pursue the sale of Barnett Shale assets. In addition we extended our Atlas gas processing agreement where we owned 27% of several plants in Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area for 10 years to 2032 to really ensured long term capacity as drilling activity continue to grow.","We\u2019re adding 400 million a day of new processing capacity coming online by the second half of 2015. The first of those plants is coming on fourth quarter in 2014 with the second plant at second half of 2015. We got coverage with our derivative of 90% of 2014 oil production at $93 a barrel, we do have upside those three way callers up to $114 a barrel for WTI. 80% of the production is protected against volatility in the Midland-Cushing oil price differential which is running today about $758 we only had about 20% expose to that number the rest of our oil is priced either out Cushing or little less in the Gulf Coast. Strong balance sheet with $260 million of cash on hand at first quarter, net debt-to-book of 27%.","Going to slide number five on drilling highlights again we\u2019ve updated the tight curves Tim will go over, better production data from 17 Wolfcamp A, B and D well, 6 lower Spraberry shale wells continue to support our strong EURs that we have shown over the last several months. we are increasing the high end the lower Spraberry shale EUR from 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. When Tim gets goes over the tight curves you can see we add several wells that are at least 1 million or exceeding 1 million barrels of oil equivalent on a normalized 700 foot laterals.","Again, a breakdown I don\u2019t go in to details on the table, but the big change is increasing our lower Spraberry from pass 75 to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent which returns roughly 45% at the low end to 100% plus returns on the high end. Continue to see the same type returns on the Wolfcamp A, B and D. we are increasing our activity in the lower Spraberry shale up from roughly 10% up closer to 15% for the rest of the year. Replacing our first key Jo Mill shale well and our first middle Spraberry shale well on production if you remember we did have prior issues with our prior Jo Mill shale well, but this is our first good completion on a Jo Mill shale well both are tracking lower Spraberry shale wells when you normalized to 7000 feet, so we\u2019re very excited about both of those results.","Going to Eagle Ford, we have 12 up Eagle Ford wells placed on production through mid April, as part of our continued down spacing and staggered program results continue to be very, very encouraging. In addition we\u2019re going to two-string design instead of three-string design it saving us somewhere between $750,000 to $1 million per well.","Going to slide number 6 on capital spending, we leaving our capital program of $3.3 billion which $3 billion for drilling capital pretty much same breakdown we\u2019ve been using since we\u2019ve announced our capital program. Obviously with higher prices the first four five months of the year we have cash flow up to about $2.5 billion now. The cash on hand we seated in the best year we have plenty of financial flexibility in part we continue to continue to accelerate drilling activity. ","Slide number seven, regarding production growth. We are still targeting 16% to 21% compounded annual production growth for the three year period from \u201914 to \u201916. You can see for the year 2014, we\u2019re at 14 to 19. You can see also on this for second quarter, our guidance range is 173 to 178. And then, obviously again, emphasizing back half loaded duty adding 11 rigs in the north for first quarter were jumping up third to fourth quarter, on average 195,000 barrels to 210,000 barrels a day. So you can see as the result increasing the number of completions in the north.","Long term, we expect to add at least five plus rigs per year in a strict price environment and in a $95 all flat environment will be adding 10 plus rigs per year long term. And again, we expect product to more than double by 2018 as compared to 2013 production. ","Going to slide number 8, just to emphasize the fact that we\u2019re second half loaded, we have a pop schedule in the number of wells from each of our three key areas; Eagle Ford, southern Wolfcamp program and then the Northern program. And if you could see, the significant increase from the 11 additional rigs that we added first quarter will be adding 50 completions in the north which will significantly get the pops up to 175 from the average of 125 to the first half of the year. ","And you can see, our second quarter guidance after submitting the earlier slide of 173 to 178 again is conservative, it\u2019s also you can see at the pop schedule, we\u2019re adding 65 wells in the second quarter as compared to 60 wells in the first quarter.","I\u2019m going to now turn it over to \u2013 no I got one more slide sorry. Obviously, as Frank mentioned, we said, in U.S. we have probably \u2013 what\u2019s nice is that, we have the largest \u2013 we have a great inventory of over 20,000 locations in the largest field of North America in the southern Wolfcamp again we\u2019re excited to get a great position that\u2019s going to drive the company obviously for decades forward.","Let me turn it over to Tim.","Tim Dove","Thanks, Scott. First and last slide was about resource potential, but in the first quarter of 2014 we made substantial in roads in the transition from a resource texture mode to one of execution of a ramped up drilling champagne that\u2019s focused on production and cash flow growth.","On slide 10, it\u2019s a recap of what we\u2019ve accomplished so far in 2013 and \u201914 in the North that shows that we\u2019ve, as Scott as already mentioned place 23 wells on production during 2013 and through the end of the first quarter. Do you really see on the map that our well control in the north, north is getting much more dense and having now pop those 23 wells in various zones through the first quarter and they are shown in the tables in the left. ","What you\u2019ll see as you look back through our production data is that, our production is proving to be more predictable in these areas as further wells are drilled in more data as accumulated and those data definitely support strong EURs and returns in this area. As Scott mentioned, we did place one of our better completed Jo Mill well shales on and in the first of the Lower Spraberry shales on production and we\u2019ll share more about that shortly. The early performance was good very good and I\u2019ll show you a slide on that in a couple of minutes. ","Turning to slide 11, actually the next three slides are similar to those from the last quarter and have been updated with recent production results from the various zones and in this particular slide, slide 11 it\u2019s the first Wolfcamp A and B wells and you can see really very consistent results \u2013 and what we\u2019ve done here is essentially add another month or so of production data from our recent IR materials. And you\u2019ll notice that the wells continue to be very consistent and in fact if you take a look at an example here at [indiscernible] a 7,400 laterals made 217 BOE in just over a year. That\u2019s comparable of course to our own vertical drilling which would make something like a 140,000 in 40 years, just gives the idea of the capital efficiency of the horizontal champagne.","When all those data continues to point to excellent production in EUR and productions of these wells, these are actually our first six wells, of course when we have seven subsequent wells on line and all the wells do point to about in the case of 7000 foot laterals, about a million BOE for Woolfcamp B in Midland County and about 800,000 BOE from Woolfcamp A in Midland County and Wolfcamp B in Martin County. So really quite outstanding results and we think more importantly consistent results and predictable results for the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A. ","Turning now to Slide 12. This is similar data as it represented in the prior slide but in this case with the Wolfcamp D wells another month or so data. They exhibit a similar pattern of consistency when it comes to production and leaves us to the view that the D wells continue to show support for EURs in the 650 to 800,000 BOE range for Midland, Martin and Andrews Counties if you say with 7,000 foot lateral. One note, if you take a look at the E.T. O\u2019Daniel well, that well a little over 9,100,000 lateral is clearly well over an 800,000 BOE well. ","Turning now to Slide 13. Here in this case I\u2019m turning to the lower Spraberry shale well results. You\u2019ll notice that the pattern of early production in the lower Spraberry shale is very different from the Wolfcamp, owing to the fact that the Lower Spraberry shale is shallower and lower pressure and it just takes a while for the load water to be produced and for oil rates to increase. ","That said here that of all the wells that are showed, of the five wells, three of these wells are exhibiting EUR production over a million BOE. And this is what has led us to what Scott had mentioned an increase to the top end of the EUR range for these lower Spraberry shales to a million barrels BOE and a headwind about 800,000 barrels. And that make some sense considering these results are really not unexpected because the lower Spraberry shale calculates to have the highest oil in place in all of the Spraberry and Wolfcamp intervals. We still believe that the production data for this we\u2019ve seen the wells on this slide present to show well suggest the range from lower shale ratio being 7,000 \u2013 for 7,000 foot lateral is 575,000 BOE to 1 million BOE now at the top end of the range.","Turning now to Slide 14. This is production data from the recent middle Spraberry shale and Jo Mill wells that we\u2019ve been talking about. The results on Slide 13 are also superimposed, so we compare how the middle Spraberry ratio and Jo Mill wells look versus the lower Spraberry shale results I just covered. You have to look little bit careful here because there are two wells shown, the red well is the Jo Mill well, Martin Country; the black well is middle Spraberry shale in Midland County. So I should decide as early days in the sense of the production of these wells were very importantly, they show very similar trajectory in their early days as they deep water as compared to lower Spraberry shale. So we\u2019re encouraged by that definitely and to the fact that these wells seem to be trekking lower Spraberry shale wells which have been among our best. So we\u2019ll continue to watch these wells to see how they compare with lower Spraberry shale and the other wells. ","Move to Slide 15. With the types of production profiles I\u2019ve just shown you it's not surprising that the returns would be very high on this drilling campaign as the payouts would be very fast and you see that in the bar charts. This was actually shown in Scott\u2019s earlier data and the green shows BTAX IRRs for the various zones and we believe that the returns are definitely going to be strong in this campaign and they would certainly suggest that, you also see in the bottom left that we have increased the lower Spraberry shale top end EUR to 1 million BOE.","Turning to Slide 16. And now we\u2019re really talking about what is happening through this year\u2019s program in the north and an update here shows that it really are in the process in the north in early stage of adjusting to more of our horizontal development campaign as opposed to appraisal it's back to the idea of executing now on more of the development campaign and focused on production growth and cash flow growth. As Scott already told you, we now had 16 rigs that was a planned number, that will allow us to drill about 140 horizontal wells this year, 85% will be in the Wolfcamp A, B, and D. With the results we\u2019ve seen so far from the Spraberry shales we now up the number of wells we\u2019ll drill in this Spraberry shales to 15%, it had been 10% that with the results we\u2019ve seen to successes both in lower Spraberry and the middle Spraberry shale, we think the right thing to do is allocate some more capital to these zones. Most of the drilling will be on three-well pads, it pushes spud-to-POP times to 145 days. The result of which is combination of pad drilling and adding rigs later in the year will be second half rates production growth profile. ","Horizontal cause in the north generally $8.5 to $9 million and we now have about 8200 foot average lateral. We continue to operate 11 vertical rigs and that\u2019s going to compare drill about 200 wells this year that are needed to meet continuous drilling obligations so as to preserve or leasehold fairly will be reducing our vertical rig count in the next several years as the rig count has increased from a horizontal perspective. ","I would point out that the photo wells, it\u2019s a pretty impressive photo at the bottom of slide 16, this is core rigs lined up in the hut lease in Midland County banging up development style wells. So that\u2019s a pretty impressive photo, we have a city on the ground there in Midland county. ","On slide 17, now turning to the southern JV area, we\u2019re also continuously focused here just as we were on the north on development drilling production through development drilling, here we\u2019ll drill 115 or so wells, a longer laterals on average at about 9400 fee and similar in terms of the fact that most of the wells were utilized three well pads. And we are now in the process of reducing our spud to POP cycle time by a few days, this is the result of sign off simultaneously putting wells on production while at the same time drilling up [indiscernible] on offset wells. ","So if we have work over rigs out there in several wells to operate on the location you can say this up to eight days. And trying as many of course when it comes to being this wells on production. We still are unchanged in the sense that we will mix about two thirds Wolfcamp be with the remainder being the other Wolfcamp zones. ","We are going to be focusing mostly in the Northern areas where the returns are higher, about $8 million of well. So we\u2019re pleased to report that the JV with Sinochem is going exceptionally well here in the south. ","On slide 18 then, we wanted to give you just a little bit of data on some other southern area wells. We thought we\u2019d update you on some of the over wells are performing and you\u2019ll see the two original Giddings wells here, these are Wolfcamp B wells having now been on production for about two in a quarter years and they have been phenomenal wells at only 5300 foot laterals. Are they are tremendous wells, they are going to look like 725,000 BOE at EURs. Of course, if we were added 7000 feet that will about 950,000 BOE. ","So it gives you an idea on our two most overly wells if you want to put it that way, really show consistent performance and they are really holding up to the curves to show strong EURs. On slide 19, Scot covered this to some extent, but we\u2019re pleased to announce that we have extended our agreement with Atlas in the Midland Basin for our ten years, the coverage area is showing actually on the map to the left here, it\u2019s been extended into Andrews County and of course portion of Martin County. You\u2019ll note there is an area Martin County is not covered by this particular coverage area, but the balance of Martin County is an area where we have another 30% in our third party plant is also in the process of expansion.","But as it relates to Atlas area, capacity will increase from about 455 million cubic feet a day to 855 cubic feet by the second half of next year. In the principle drivers of that are the Edward plant showing the map in the south, there is a 200 million cubic feet a plant that should come on in the fourth quarter and there are plant in the north to deal with Martin County and Andrews County production another 200 million cubic feet a day. We still retain about 27% of the interest in those plants.","Our production only makes about third of the gas process, which gives you an idea that we\u2019re not the only operator growing production in the Permian Basin and the Midland Basin. There is a substantial other new production coming online, which means we need to stay ahead of high return bottlenecks and short term bottlenecks when it comes to moving production. But we think it\u2019s pretty clear at this point there is another 200 million cubic feet a day plant will be required basically every year as we and the rest of the industry cranks up the drilling champagne. So the Atlas extension is really part of our continuing efforts to be forward-looking with bottlenecks in terms of processing. ","On slide 20 then, as expected after all this effort, it should be culminating an increase in production and ramp up of production and the Permian is certainly delivering on that front, you see production having increased 86,000 BOE compared to 79 last year and 80 in the fourth quarter, we have put 56 wells on production across the basin in the first quarter, I\u2019m sorry, 28 wells on production and we drilled 56. Looking forward we\u2019re going to be drilling on total of 255 horizontal wells combined in both north and south again utilizing three-well pads and the top schedule as Scott already alluded to is very significantly back half weighted. We are drilling horizontal production as we speak our net basis grew 4000 barrels a day over the last quarter.","After in to Eagle Ford shale side 21, we\u2019re still getting very encouraging results on the upper Eagle Ford shale testing back we put 12 up Eagle Ford shale wells on production through mid-April and results look quite excellent. We\u2019ll be drilling another 45 upper Eagle Ford shale wells this year as a part of what we have to discussed last quarter down spacing staggering effort to move the spacing down from the original say 1000 feet to 500 feet now we went to the lower range 175 to 300 feet and staggering between the low and upper levels. Average lateral length this year is up to about 6100 feet compared to about 5000 last year. About 25% of our acreage is perspective for that upper zone.","Turning now to slide 22, we were seeing record production being set by Eagle Ford quite regularly, we\u2019ve seen substantial increase in the first quarter to about 43,000 BOE per day from 38 last year and 40 in the fourth quarter drilled about 34 wells with 32 on production. For 110 wells schedule this year it\u2019s going to be the basis of three and four-well pads in this case which again push us out top timing.","We are now utilizing for about 80% of our wells in the first quarter particularly two-string casing design instead of three-string design essentially it saves you days and of course casing and cost savings. We calculated it saves about 7 days we can be on the well on average of 22 days instead of 29 days by taking out one of the intermediate strings. And importantly the net cost reduction is about $750,000 to $1 million per well.","We more in detail covered in our fourth quarter goals are down spacing and optimization and we continue to see tremendous benefits probably EUR increases in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% very little capital combination of down spacing staggering emission earlier but in the case of completion optimization things like pumping more profit, pumping more high rate fluids, and altering the stages in our cluster spacing. They\u2019re all generating tremendous returns with very little capital.","So I\u2019m going to stop there, I can just simply say in summary from an operations perspective we are executing at a high level in midst of rapid exploration in terms of drilling particularly in the north part of the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area. And with that I\u2019m going to pass over to Rich, he can discuss the first quarter financials and the second quarter outlook.","Rich Dealy ","Right, thanks Tim. Good morning, I may start on slide 23, where we showed net income attributable to common stockholders of $123 million, or $0.85 per diluted share that did include mark-to-market derivative losses of $55 million or $0.38 per diluted share and then couple unusual items Barnett shale discontinued operations and the other of tax benefit related to our Premier Silica acquisition a couple years ago, so adjusting for those items we had $183 million or $1.26 per diluted share for the quarter.","Looking at the page 23 where we did show first quarter guidance relative to our results, so we had an excellent quarter as Scott and Tim both mentioned with results \u2013 within guidance are on positive side of guidance other than mainly G&A which was above guidance primarily due to just people related costs that were incurred to support our growth initiatives as we move throughout the year.","Turning to slide 24 on price realizations, we see a another good quarter in terms of pricing oil was up 2% $92.38 per barrel, NGLs were up 9% principally related to strong propane prices during the quarter and then gas prices were up substantially 40% at $4.81. You can see results of our derivatives activity at the bottom of this line, that\u2019s included derivative income or loss on the P&L.","Turning to slide 25 on production cost, first quarter production cost were consistent with prior periods, as you may recall we talked about in February our fourth quarter was lower due to adjustments related third party transportation cost and then lower than estimated ad valorem tax payments during the fourth quarter so that was a benefit in the fourth quarter, got back to normal in the first quarter here. ","Turning to Slide 26. The company\u2019s financial position, still very strong financial position with plenty of liquidity as you can see with $257 million cash on the balance sheet and $1.4 billion available under our credit facility. As you saw in the press release, it's further strengthened by the sale of Alaska that happened in April and then if you look at the projection Scott talked about 2.6 billion of cash position basically cash for EBITDA, our debt EBITDA of 1 times. ","Turning to Slide 27 for the second quarter guidance. This does exclude discontinued operations, so we\u2019re showing production in the 173,000 to 178,000 BOEs per day and then if you look at the rest of the items on this page there consistent with past guidance were results of the [Indiscernible] leave those for your review and then we\u2019ll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first question from Douglas Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks, good morning everybody. I wonder if could take a couple of questions please. The first one Scott, I just want to ask a big picture question about guidance because I realize it's relatively recently that you gave your longer term production guidance but I want to dig into what assumptions you\u2019re making within your EUR entities are quite white particularly in the Wolfcamp B and obviously not in the lower Spraberry, we\u2019ve also seen I guess some reference for the strip prices as the basis of your cash flow and your spending and obviously all placing you substantially higher so I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for what's the big thing to your guidance because it kind of strikes us that you\u2019re probably being a little bit conservative.","Scott Sheffield","","Thanks, and then no, we\u2019re still using a lower type EUR in our analysis in regard to production growth. The average is about 700,000 to 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent, so we are not modeling 1 million barrels of oil equivalent and we\u2019re also not modeling that allow these laterals that went out to somewhere between 8,300 and 9,300 feet. It's we are being conservative, it's best to be conservative. In regard to prices as I mentioned earlier, and we have stated publically is that we\u2019re looking at the strip environment, the strip the rest of year is about $95 to $96. It drops down to about $80 by 2019, so that\u2019s one of our cases, that\u2019s the case that we\u2019re using in the three year production and also in the five years to double production. I mean in that case we\u2019re adding roughly about five plus rigs per year in the horizontal side in the Permian basin and then we also have a case where if crude continues to perform like it has in 2014, $95 of oil, if it stays flat for next several years we\u2019ll be adding ten plus rigs. Obviously that case wouldn\u2019t achieve much, much higher production growth rates. We do not have that case out there publically.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You feel operationally Scott you\u2019ve got the capability to deal with in terms of securing drilling permits and line men and I think [Indiscernible] stuff I mean it's easy just to turn up the dial that quickly you know they\u2019ve got instead of five rigs, you got ten rigs?","Scott Sheffield","Well the team handled adding 11 rigs basically in that time period very well up in the north and so adding five to ten plus rigs I wouldn\u2019t use the word easy but.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yeah, it means trouble.","Scott Sheffield","","Yeah, over 1,600 employees in Midland, so we have the \u2013 we\u2019re the largest employer out there, so we\u2019re way ahead of the competition, so we\u2019re very, very confident we can accomplish that.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks, my follow up is not to take away from the Permian but before in the Eagle Ford given the success that you assuming to having on the upper Eagle Ford and as we do a broad question if I made because obviously you aren\u2019t really giving us an update on how that tape curve looks or well cost you recently but some of your competitors have been talking about this particularly ConocoPhillips, it appeared to be spending $3 billion drilling 200 wells and they are telling us that their numbers are more realistic in terms of their total spending and given that you guys are pretty much late in the CMA, I just wonder if you can give some perspective as to what the economics of roles are looking, what are your current cost are and if I need tag on the end there, any update on your view of potential condense exports in our view there.","Scott Sheffield","","Yeah. That\u2019s a long question, but economic of $3 billion on 300 that\u2019s $15 million a well, it seems high but our well cost obviously were much less than that, so and especially with going to the two string design. So we\u2019re still \u2013 it\u2019s somewhere between $7 million, $8 million well cost with a 50% IRR and that\u2019s coupled with the fact that we\u2019re getting about $8 to $10 dollars a barrel of WTI for [indiscernible] price. ","In regard to the longer picture question, we are still involved with several other independent producers discussing with the commerce department administration educating congress in regard with the importance to allow oil to be exported. We still stay [indiscernible], we think it will take a good two to three years to convince them and to allow all export. I think it\u2019s important of this country to do it. It\u2019s important to keep this industry moving forward. So we are still confident that something will happen at some point in time.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","[indiscernible] can I tell you down on the cost of Eagle Ford alluded for infrastructure what is that number?","Scott Sheffield","On infrastructure, we\u2019re done with infrastructure -- $7 to $8 million remember we\u2019ve put in place 13 CCPs all the pods, all the production facilities over the last four and a half years, we\u2019re pretty much done with infrastructure.","Douglas Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s extremely helpful, thanks guys. I appreciate it. ","Operator","And you\u2019ll hear next from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Yes. Good morning, gentleman. I wanted to ask a question about the Middle Spraberry Shale and the Jo Mill Shale. It seems just a little bit out of your pattern to me, maybe I\u2019m little bit interpreting what you are doing, but it seems a little bit out of your pattern of being conservative to say that these wells are tracking a type of given that we have \u2013 it looks about 15 days in about one and 30 days on the other. And I\u2019m wondering if there is more \u2013 there is more data than being presenting here on this slide, it may be about pressures or total fluid rates or maybe it\u2019s a confidence from what you are seeing that offset operators that has you guys so excited at the service stage factors?","Scott Sheffield","No. Overall, Charles, I don\u2019t think long term it\u2019s going to compete with the top horizons. But we need to let history play its over out. And we thought the same thing about the lowest Spraberry Shale when you first came on. And so, before we make a final decision, what\u2019s encouraging is that that Jo Mill well is the first one we\u2019ve got a great completion on and it\u2019s still climbing even through today on the yesterday\u2019s report. And so, when you when you normalize, if you notice both of those wells, the middle and the lower, I mean, middle and the Jo Mill, we\u2019re short of laterals. One is I think 4200 feet, the other one is less 5047 \u2013 4700 feet laterals. So when you normalize all the 7000 feet, they are right on track obviously and they are making the same amount of water, they are still performing exact same way, it\u2019s in a lower pressure regime. ","The Jo Mill if you remember has been opened up and on most of our 7000 plus vertical wells. It\u2019s been opened up over the last 30, 40 years. The Middle Spraberry Shale has not. So we\u2019re going to drill more wells, we\u2019re excited about it, it\u2019s still arguably very economical. Some of the offset operators are now opened up the Middle Spraberry Shale with very good results also. We are still the only company to my knowledge that\u2019s drilled Jo Mill wells. ","Frank Hopkins","This is Frank. I think it\u2019s important that the point scratchers made it that we\u2019ve exchanged some cadre with some of pears and so. We now have their Middle Spraberry Shales wells are performing. So this is much along the same lines. ","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","All right. Thanks, Scott and Frank. And then, if I could to go back to the lower or excuse me, the southern JV part of the Midland basin. I think, the slide 18 you guys have is really a \u2013 it\u2019s very power side, just \u2013 department out, because it has that 2 plus years of data, but I\u2019m wondering if also you could give a little bit of an update if possible on what the down spacing gas are looking like here in the south. I know there supposed to be a second half event, but you have to give me shot since we\u2019re within month or so of that.","Tim Dove","Yeah, I think the down spacing just shows Tim we\u2019re still working on it, we did a very large campaign at the beginning we\u2019re still watching those well resource it turns out all the wells basically producing similarly among the [indiscernible] 12 wells, we have another big, spacing task that we\u2019re working on over rock B which is to the east and the results actually look quite good there, we\u2019ve down space two-well pad, either Wolfcamp B wells to about 400 feet or so about 78 are spacing compared to some offset 1000 feet up to 180 acre space was, it will take extended period of time before we have this thing figured out, but there is an example where there also wells that like performing in line with each other and so. I would just call early days we also have about three other areas in the basin where we doing offset spacing test. So you kind of have to bear with us as we get the results on this. We see areas in the \u2013 even in the north where we\u2019re going to be doing some testing as well.","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","That\u2019s great detail, thanks Tim.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Kistler of Simmons & Company.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Good morning guys.","Tim Dove","Hi, Dave.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","I wanted to address the redirection capital in the northern Permian with 5% more going over of its Spraberry portion of the play. When we look at those that you guys highlighted and shown in slide, it takes a longer time for them to deal water and bring production up to peak levels. With that in mind capitals going over there, but your production targets are unchanged however that the low would indicate that production would shift out to the right. So I guess the just my question is, if I\u2019m thinking about that correctly you probably have greater confidence in the production rates -- current production rates and the full production rates of our Wolfcamp wells and the ability to hit that production target given the way that slow probably also factors in the strong 15 start to production, is that a fair way to think about this?","Tim Dove","Yeah, I think first of all, those lower Spraberry shale wells increase will be in last part of the year, so you will see very little production from that, when you look at the tight curves it gives obviously a lot more stability and much flatter production even though it comes up slower you don\u2019t get the pop like you do on the Wolfcamp wells in a higher pressure, but you get a much better flying curves. And there is chance that even a couple of these lower Spraberry shale wells would end up being better than any of the Wolfcamp A or B wells. So eventually going in to late this year next year we\u2019ll probably be going to some four-well pads also instead of three-well pads.","Scott Sheffield","I think I add Dave is that we\u2019re talking about 5% of 140 wells, we\u2019re talking about 7 wells out of the 140, so we can\u2019t have too materialize like you would.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Okay, appreciate for that clarification. And then going back to the Atlas agreement, so you guys trying to accelerate the outlook there is a need for 200 million a day processing facility every 12 months versus every 18 months. Can you talk a little bit about whether that\u2019s driven by PXD specific activity concentrated near those processing facilities that\u2019s going to be potentially accelerated industry activity or it just production rates you spend a lot higher than you thought or there some adjustment to next, just we\u2019re trying to kind of drill down in to why that accelerated so much?","Tim Dove","Yes. Obviously, our wells performing much better, and third party growth the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp at over 250 rigs in the conversion from vertical to horizontal Wolfcamp is occurring much faster than expected over the last 12 months and continued to accelerate. So it\u2019s combination of our growth, it\u2019s combination of obviously the third party growth, the combination of several companies are going to the IPO market and raising capital switching the horizontal drilling so it\u2019s a combination of all of that that\u2019s driving the factor, where we move down from 18 months to 200 million day gas plant every 12 months and we\u2019ve been spending time with Atlas over the last probably two years convincing them that this is a huge play, it\u2019s the largest in the North America and we need to have plants built essentially every 12 months, they may get down to point where we may need a plant every 9 to 10 months at point of time.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","Okay. I appreciate that, we got to mind if there are appropriate or did they have appropriate financing capacity to deliver on that?","Tim Dove","Yes, I\u2019ve been talking to the chairman [Indiscernible] and he promised me that they have plenty of financial flexibility to keep up.","David Kistler - Simmons & Company","","Great, appreciate [Indiscernible]. Thank you so much.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll hear from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","","Good morning guys. Just as we think about the resource potentials that continues to expand. You guys have previously given some targets on your long-term acceleration potential in the northern Midland basin. As one if you have any updated dots in regards to how large of a program that could become in regards to the rig count and as we think about kind of 2015 and 2016 what do you need to see from a well production perspective or from a pricing perspective to potentially upside acceleration in your drilling program?","Tim Dove","Yes, we have that stage earlier. Under the strip price environment, we\u2019re adding five plus rigs per year, most of those are be in the north and then they have $95 flat case if it continue to March 4 the current year into 2015 then we\u2019ll probably more likely adding ten plus rigs per year above the next several years. Under that scenario the growth rate will be much higher than our 16% to 21% compounded growth rate. Prices continue to go up this year, all prices start stay flat to the rest of this year we may obviously some time towards the end of the year [Indiscernible] also. Anything else?","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","","And then just second question. In regards to these service cost environment in the Permian and if you can provide some color just how you\u2019re staying cost trends and if there is any areas in particularly see some pinch points on.","Tim Dove","Yeah, Matt this is Tim. I think in general we see cost is pretty flat this year compared to last year, I think one of the main areas where we see a bump that\u2019s coming we have to compete with is in labor. Labor is tight, it's across the board, where its rigs or pulling in it's or upstream activities, upstream operations and I think labors one of your key areas. I think as you go forward into 2015, we\u2019ll see a bump in rig cost, we are seeing some increases being profit when it comes to well actually pressure pumping for the second half of the year. I think it's going to be substantial versus negatively really affect we\u2019re trying to accomplish the most of the things we\u2019re doing is internal but there are signs that we already tightening the rig count is going to increase three times not only for us but for others. And so it was a mixed bag I think right now we call it more flat other than a bit going forward we\u2019re seeing increased potential. ","Matt Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","","Thank you very much.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","Tim Dove","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","","Just want to pick a little bit on the cost front, if you touched a bit on the rig completion side though wonder if you think you\u2019re on vertical integration as partially why you\u2019re not seeing more and may be you comment on that but I want to also touch on the midstream side which is \u2013 what impact that you expect to see on both your transportation costs and on your price realization for oil, gas, NGLs from deals like the Atlas One and then just as yours and other Permian volumes about volumes grow.","Tim Dove","Yeah, I think that the fact is our transportation cost now are in couple of different areas, one is gathering costs which in some case that have to be trekking and other cases will do in closed pipeline, those are some increases in the past but it's pretty level right now. We\u2019re going to be moving more todays putting volumes on pipe which is lower cost, trying to about 75% gathering on pipe. When it comes to the longer transportation, so for example we\u2019re dealing with [Indiscernible] and the new pipeline systems we\u2019ve seen some increases in FT cost for those pipelines going forward but still they represent quite excellent opportunities for us. So make sure we can move volumes out of the Midland and avoid the Midland pushing bases differential. But overall as an example with the Atlas we grab pretty much standard POP contracts on most of our gas processing that really are just more matter of what are happening \u2013 what is happening with both NGL and natural gas prices.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it. Is there some number you could put to the operating cost per barrel impact that there are any inflationary impact you see of trying to get the incremental, trying to get more barrels out in the Permian or what you would see next year and the year after versus this year. I mean, new builds where we assume would be more expensive as we go forward.","Tim Dove","","Yeah, I think new built rigs, I would say that early estimate for 2015 will be 10% higher and of course that\u2019s not a very substantial amount of the well cost, but your completions might be in the same neighbourhood 10% higher to extended recent third parties. When you look at the rest of the operating cost, I guess, say labor is up probably 10% this quarter, like [indiscernible] is going up and that will have an effect as well. So I think we\u2019re probably looking at 10 percentage in terms of kind of cost creep volume of 2015.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, you can essentially monetize assets over the last few years in part of balance year out as then. As we go forward, do you, and especially as natural gas prices in futures have up, do you see continued asset monetization on more of the asset front and then ultimately do you see yourself heading towards peer play Permian or peer play Permian plus Eagle Ford company.","Scott Sheffield","I think, we\u2019re pretty much nearing on a peer play Permian\/Eagle Ford Company today. We do have the gas or oil and gas NGO assets, two in Mid-Continent and the one in Raton bay very long life, very low decline rate, it gives us an option on gas long term in our \u2013 all of our drilling activity is self-funding, in regard to when you give wells a pay-out 1 to 2 years in the \u2013 whether it\u2019s Eagle Ford or whether it\u2019s Permian, it allows us continue to accelerate, so we have no further needs for assets investors other than Barnett. We hope to get Barnett obviously covering sometime by the end of the year.","Tim Dove","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And John Freeman of Raymond James has our next question.","John Freeman - Raymond James","","Good morning, guys. ","Scott Sheffield","Hi, John.","John Freeman - Raymond James","Looking at \u2013 currently with your running 11 vertical rigs in the Spraberry in your own 15 vertical rigs, I just to have a couple of questions along the lines, do you or any of your vertical rigs being used by 3 parties and overtime it\u2019s more and more horizontal drilling starts to help me that continuous drilling obligation you have, should we assume that 18 months or so that, you may look at your selling vertical drilling rigs?","Timothy Dove","John, you are kind of a head of us a little bit. We have actually sold our vertical rigs and we do not currently operate any of our own rigs vertically.","John Freeman - Raymond James","All right. And then on the upper Eagle Ford [indiscernible] has some pretty positive comments this morning on that, following six wells one of them was pretty big. And they mentioned that and they are obviously kind of in general same area as Jo and they mentioned that they were in some cases mixing the upper Eagle Ford on the Austin Chalk, and I know you aren\u2019t giving necessarily [indiscernible] but maybe just they need to some color you could provide the upper Eagle for what you are seeing so far.","Timothy Dove","John, I think our objective right now is to complete those wells and keep it all in the Eagle Ford. That\u2019s just been our mandate internally from the standpoint review of science group and that\u2019s what we are doing. So we\u2019re really not trying to \u2013 I mean, into the Austin Chalk, sorry.","John Freeman - Raymond James","That\u2019s great guys, great quarter.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Arun Jayaram of Credit Suisse. ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","","Good morning, guys.","Timothy Dove","Good morning, Arun.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Tim, I just wanted to talk or see if you could elaborate a little bit on the potential improvements and things spread Spraberry shales. I just wanted to see if maybe you could use the south as a guide and just give us a sense of where you think those could go to in 2015.","Timothy Dove","By south you mean [indiscernible]? ","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Yeah. ","Timothy Dove","Well, first of all, that\u2019s where the money is, we\u2019re trying to reduce this spread the pop timing and as I already mentioned to you, we are already doing quite a bit there with regards to signoff to try to actually [indiscernible] to try to actually improve those numbers and we\u2019ve been very successful so far.","I think the real question is, what can we do in terms of going even past three well pads to four well pads, maybe even higher and increasingly use [indiscernible] to make sure that we cut these out. What we\u2019re also trying to do of course we\u2019ve seen some success already over the last year or so we\u2019ve been drilling wells there, it\u2019s actually just reduced the time on well. So this has to do with your drilling efficiencies, it has to do with basically focus on operations and also has to do with your completion profile. ","But I think the answer is, today, we\u2019re probably out of the 130 to 140 days something like that. And I think it\u2019s not reasonable for us over the next couple of years to drop 15 to 20 days.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Alright. And then you end the year I guess 65 kind of horizontal wells kind of in your inventory which have been completed so 15 should start off with the pretty good healthy ramp, is that fair?","Timothy Dove","Yeah, what I think the situation with our three-well pads is we\u2019re actually drilling \u2013 we\u2019re actually spreading the well just drilling the surface intermediate section first and then you go back to drill lateral sections of each well, so we talk about spreading oils it really isn\u2019t necessarily the case to our drilling well particularly we did a process in most cases we\u2019re drilling surface intermediate and lateral therefore it\u2019s a situation where a rig can have three well that are in progress even before the three-well pad is drilling on as wells on production. So you\u2019re right, I mean when we have the track maker I guess you called there is top line I guess in this case, out there 60, we\u2019re going to be in pretty good shape, we able to hit first quarter 2015 running pretty hard.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","Great, and just my final question. Scott, you talked about what kind of underpin you plan up to 2018 five incremental rigs at the trip, I know you guys have a pretty conservative board, I just wanted to see if your thoughts on. Can you generate the CapEx needs internally generated through obviously you have the Barnett shale, thoughts on funding that growth?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, if you look at the current slide that we\u2019ve been showing, yeah, these wells pad one or two years because of the short pay up it allows us to get cash flow return so strong that it allows us to reinvest and continued to have rigs without going to equity markets or without further investors other than Barnett. So that\u2019s even with the strip price environment going down to $80. That we adding five plus rigs per year and then as I said, the upside case of $95 flat for the next several years with obviously much \u2013 which have much higher growth rates in our 16% to 21% compounded annual growth rate under that scenario, but we adding 10 plus rigs per year and that\u2019s again self-funding.","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s great Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Anything else?","Arun Jayaram - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s it.","Operator","Okay, very good. We\u2019ll hear next from Will Green of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Will Green - Stephens","Good morning guys. I wonder if you could talk about the, you kind of touch on completion changes you guys are seeing have an uplift on your start rates and that sort of thing. One thing you mentioned was pumping more sand. Are you guys still using Brady Brown in all the Permian? And then moving forward, looking at the ramp you guys have, will Premier Silica still serve all of that need? And are you guys doing any reason code in some of the deeper part at all?","Scott Sheffield","The answer is almost 100% we pumped in our Permian base well is Brady Brown we have a little bit of white sand that use from time to time, it\u2019s near [indiscernible] but principally it\u2019s almost all Brady Brown by going forward what\u2019s going to be needed because of this substantial rig count increase Scott was alluding to is expansion of our Brady mine, I anticipate commence operations on that expansion sometime next year and have sand available in 2016. So we\u2019re actually building up the mine to meet our needs.","Will Green - Stephens","Gotcha thanks. And then other one I had is on kind of the way these pads are going to be configured, you guys already mentioned that you\u2019re going to be doing a little bit more Spraberry work this year. But how should we think about most of these big pads being configured? Is there going to be three Ds, is there going to be A, D, A, what do you guys think at this point is the best way to pair these wells up together, being mine folded that probably different areas of the base and the middle of it different?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, I think that\u2019s a great question, I mean, fantastic question we\u2019re trying to answer this is what is the optimal combination of wells on pads, so is to optimally develop an area realizing that it\u2019s pretty definitive especially if we\u2019re talking about the northern areas that we have quite excellent potential in the Wolfcamp A, B, D and the lower Spraberry shale, I think you can see from the day that\u2019s pretty definitive. At the same time we\u2019re trying to get the day that we\u2019re talking about earlier more fully enhanced regarding the middle Spraberry shale and more Jo Mill wells that are properly completed. So I think we kind of have to hold off until we really know that because you could be in a situation you\u2019re doing four or five stack laterals on a staggered basis on one pad. And so then you average like multiple wells on a pad not just in this three or four in the wells per pad. So I would really kind of hold off answer that that we really understand the full data set that I think it's likely we\u2019re going to have multiple zone stack laterals when we finally get to that campaign.","Scott Sheffield","Got you, thanks for the color guys.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Hey guys, just want to kind of get back to the Jo Mill and middle Spraberry and the northern part of the Midland here, you guys talked that your lower Spraberry kind of have the most oil in place perhaps you can give us kind of a relative comparison of oil in place for the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry relative to lower here.","Scott Sheffield","I think we\u2019ve calculate about half in each case on a per acre basis.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Okay that\u2019s helpful and I guess looks like in the so in part of the Midland looks like most all what you\u2019re doing is Wolfcamp when I gather from your presentation, is that going to need Spraberry testing anytime this year or next year in the southern Midland?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, we\u2019re actually going to do some this year and some more next year. Most of our Spraberry shale wells are in the north half of our 845,000 acres and so that we\u2019ll be drilling some later this year and next year in the southern half including the JB areas where we own 100% in the Spraberry rights. So we\u2019ll be evaluating the southern 400,000 acres in some of those Spraberry shale wells over the next 6 to 12 months.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","All right, thank you guys.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Amir Arif of Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks, good morning guys. Hey Scott, I appreciate your color that you don\u2019t need to sell any additional assets but be on which it got out there already to fund your five additional rigs as you go forward but at the same time you said you would like to add ten rigs if it keep you out of cash for 95 oil and so any thought or desire to monetize some of your midstream assets [Indiscernible] MLP or selling to an MLP to free up some of the capital that accelerated just given the success you are having in the Permian?","Scott Sheffield","Well farm rigs gets us to the 80 rigs and [Indiscernible] rigs gets us to the roughly 120 rigs at some point in time and so nobody to my knowledge in any of the shale plays have been running in between 100 not one single company. So we\u2019re accelerating already under the current plan. In regard to \u2013 if had divested \u2013 when you divested your processing assets you essentially lose control. I\u2019m very concerned about our execution risk would go up significantly due to the fact that we have an ownership with Atlas has allowed us to educate them and allowed us to both join together, accelerate so when you lose control of your gas processing assets, your execution risk goes up significantly higher. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why we haven't looked at it.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay, I appreciate that. And then a quick question, you\u2019ve given second half formed as a 195 [Indiscernible] can you give us an estimate of where you think you\u2019ll exiting the year on your production?","Scott Sheffield","","We will do that later on sometime but obviously not now but obviously that would be way over 200,000 plus.","","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay, and then finally on the Permian basin, it can move very well this year, and any color on 50 just for the basis or I mean is there any concern for you guys out there?","Scott Sheffield","","Say it again.","","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","","Are you getting Permian basis?","Scott Sheffield","","Oh well, yeah. It drops to the 375 in July 1st on going forward long-term and so that\u2019s with the [Indiscernible] coming on July 1st, I mean it states pretty much better with next three to five years with our \u2013 we\u2019ll be getting a lot of our as [Indiscernible] comes on and the expansion comes on this year and with the other two lines that are coming on in 50, we do have capacity on those one in the Gulf Coast, a lot of our crudes going to be priced off [Indiscernible] down in the Gulf Coast and so we\u2019ll have a balanced of mostly cussing and then less pricing, so we see no need at this point of time to do any hedging.","Amir Arif - Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","","Thanks, lot of them are answered. I guess just wanted to come back the question on efficiencies from a little bit different angle, as it think about 15 the sort of thing that the ratio of top the world\u2019s drill in the northern program approach as the southern program in 2015 to have them like.","Scott Sheffield","I really thank you about them. You realizing when you\u2019re ramping up you get this massive effect of creating a popping. If you waiting on all the operation the same option, the three-well pads and the four-well pads to get to all the wells that we put on production. Once you are at a point, we were at a run rate of rigs that are stabilized, that number comes dramatically down. Now the question is how many rigs we add next and when. So to the extent we have five, let\u2019s just say with ten rigs in the north next year. We\u2019ll still see that effect until we get more stabilized, but it will be much less dramatic simply because you have much bigger basic product at that point. So you\u2019ll see less swings on opportunity basis.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then on the lower Spraberry and in the Middle Spraberry wells, what are difference in operating cost on those wells giving, it seems like quite a bit more watered being handled there. ","Scott Sheffield","","Yeah. I think you are right. You do see more water in those zones, but I think our water handling is really not going to be a very percentage of the cost increase. I would say it\u2019s relatively immaterial. ","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then, on the topic of water, as it look out to around some activity, you and others are projecting \u2013 we\u2019ve heard some rumours around this sourcing water in the Midland Basin and click type going forward, any color on that or doing a secure frac water?","Scott Sheffield","We are, Michael, very, very active in making sure that we have adequate water supplies and its using essentially in all the above strategy which has to do with acquiring non-potable water sources, acquiring affluent water sources from some of the municipalities using brackish water, very much limiting fresh water is the objective of all this exercise and then finally we are doing a substantial number of pilots on water recycling and clean up. We have in place a new LLC inside the company which is called Pioneer Water Management. Their main job is to get water to our locations refracting and drilling. Based on what I\u2019ve seen in terms of early returns, we are making a tremendous amount of progress in this regards such as to in a situation where water would not be an issue. We can deliver water relatively cheaply to all of our locations. It\u2019s going to take capital over the next several years. And so that shouldn\u2019t be ignored but the fact is we\u2019re all over this and I think we\u2019re going to be very successful. ","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then on the topic of capital that the 400 million of infrastructure land and plans and 100 of [indiscernible] and other ancillary cost, how long do we kind of think about that as run rate as you ramp up like it\u2019s an Eagle Ford you kind of had moved beyond that, how long does it work through that spending. ","Scott Sheffield","I think as we dig out and it\u2019s going to come down as the facilities, so that facilities membership gone down since June as we go into \u201815, \u201816, because we\u2019re pretty much of what completed most of our facilities those in the Permian basin. Lane will continue, we\u2019re still going to go after contagious acreage trying to upgrade our and achieve longer laterals. So we always have a land budget pretty much fairly equal over the next several years. And on equipment, I think Tim has probably already commented, but longer term, based on the current rates we see or probably continue to do the replacement equipment only and go and start using more and more third parties overtime. But it all depends on the power and the charges that the third party companies are charging on frac rates. ","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then, I guess, last one of mine and it\u2019s just, as it relates to the new plant and the new build out where that was pretty constrained from a processing standpoint between and when the new plan comes on in Martin in 2015, we have enough room that present, obviously you can kind of navigate around little bit, but \u2013 ","Scott Sheffield","Now, we\u2019ve already mentioned publically that we built into our guidance for the second half of the year that, there is probably about four to five months of we\u2019re rejecting ethylene mineral guidance. Obviously, we get a pickup in cash flow or it\u2019s neutral. And so that\u2019s built into our guidance. We\u2019re looking our ways, but at this point in time we don\u2019t know whether that we can feed off some of the gas to other operators in a system for a period of around four to five months. So that\u2019s an upside. But right now it is built into our guidance before the \u2013 and there is a chance that we could get the plant coming on in fourth quarter up a little bit earlier also. That\u2019s not built in also.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. Can you remind me roughly how much I guess volumes being project themselves? Is that potentially a little bit of uplift in \u201815 quantify that?","Scott Sheffield","In \u201915 there is no projection, because the plants coming on right now fourth quarter of \u201914.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying is what\u2019s the potential uplift in \u201915?","Scott Sheffield","The projection will basically start around June and to go through October and November that\u2019s what we have built in to our guidance.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Scott Sheffield","It\u2019s probably about 1000 or 2000 barrels a day net, it would represent our current projection that would be picked up \u201815 versus even when we face this issue during the second half of this year.","Michael Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, that\u2019s all. Appreciated guys, thank you, good quarter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a follow up question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead sir. Doug, your line is open.","Scott Sheffield","Okay, next. What\u2019s the next question?","Timothy Dove","We must to drop off. If there any questions?","Operator","Yes, we\u2019ll take our next question from Phillips Johnston of Capital One.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Hey guys, thanks. In the southern Wolfcamp area you\u2019re focusing on the higher return areas in the north, I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us [indiscernible] of what percentage of your overall acreage position that area represents. And also if you can just discuss the differences in returns and that area versus the acreage in southern region?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Phillips, I just give you a feel for it, we\u2019re probably making 60% to 70% returns in the north based on the area up there typically generating 5, 6, 700,000 barrel BOE and then south of course in some of the areas the very south it\u2019s in the neighborhood of 400,000 BOE, so I\u2019d say that\u2019s why it splits probably two thirds of acreage is that acreage that we have sideway returns in the north.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Okay, and then south obviously about third of your wells this year plan for A, C and D of those three zones which is the most the de-risk at this point do you think?","Scott Sheffield","I think the A is the most de-risk in the southern Wolfcamp, we\u2019re just now putting our first C well on production, we\u2019re just now going to be producing our first D well.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo \u2013 IHS","Yeah, just quickly, could you describe \u2013 walking me through thought process that allow you to eliminate the extra casing string in the Eagle Ford?","Scott Sheffield","I think if you look at it \u2013 if you look at ways to reduce cost at all times, I think there is being exactly the same thing lot of other operators done, and we\u2019ve just been piggybacking on that, but basically it\u2019s understanding and experience when it comes to port pressure and controlling midway. And we\u2019re drilling in the deepest part of the basin on average so this is something we held off doing for sometime but as we got more understanding we think it\u2019s pretty clear we can eliminate a string and we\u2019ve been very successful in doing that. So I think we de-risk than 100% now.","Sven Del Pozzo \u2013 IHS","So is the lateral portion of the well shorter, but you\u2019re getting similar well performance to one where the lateral longer?","Scott Sheffield","I mentioned in the call that our lateral links have increased actually pretty substantially and so we\u2019re getting really quite excellent well performance actually better well performance than we ever had the couple exceeding the lateral plus are optimization campaign when it comes to other wells are completed, so actually the well are doing significantly better in combining those aspect.","Sven Del Pozzo \u2013 IHS","And is the upper Eagle Ford I guess over how much total acreage position, Eagle Ford is the upper Eagle Ford do you think is prospective?","Scott Sheffield","About 25%.","Sven Del Pozzo \u2013 IHS","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time I\u2019ll turn the floor back over to Scott Sheffield.","Scott Sheffield","","Again we appreciate everybody\u2019s time, taking the time and effort to listen to our first quarter call, look forward to I\u2019m talking to you on our second quarter call in August. Thank you. "],"17275":["Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD) Q1 2018 Earnings Call May  3, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Timothy L.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, April, and good day, everyone, and thank you again this quarter for joining us.","I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim is going to be up first. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2018 and give a quick overview of what expectations are for the remainder of the year. He's also going to highlight our continuing strong horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin, and that will be followed by a review of Pioneer's template for enhancing shareholder value.","After Tim concludes his remarks, Rich will update you on our firm transportation commitments to move oil from Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we're receiving from growing refinery and export sales in this market.

I'll be retiring from Pioneer at the end of May. I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the investors and analysts that I have had the privilege to interact with during my past 13 years at Pioneer. It's been a truly rewarding experience, and I can only hope that my successor, Neal Shah, will enjoy leading the IR team at Pioneer as much as I have.","And with that, Tim, over to you.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Good morning, everybody, and thanks, Frank.","I'd certainly like to follow up on your commentary by saying all of us here would like to express our sincere gratitude to you for all the years that you've been our top IR executive for 13 years. As you join me, as we both know and our management team, on more than 50 quarterly calls, on myriad countless investor conferences and meetings over the years, you've been the consummate professional in your craft. And for that, we're very appreciative. You've been voted the top IR executive, as cited by II [Institutional Investor] in the last few years, and you can't do any better than that.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","But we're very confident Neal Shah will do a great job in filling Frank's footsteps. And, Frank, all I can say is we'll see you off in Naples, Florida whenever the weather is bad in Dallas.","So let's now turn to slide 3 and talk about the results for the first quarter. Our first quarter results were very strong, and they clearly demonstrate a highly profitable growth plan going forward, a product really that's very much a function of high-return wells and increasing productivity per well.","For the quarter, we reported adjusted income of $284 million or $1.66 per diluted share. Our Permian Basin production for the quarter came in at the top end of the range at 260,000 BOE per day. That's an increase of about 9,000 BOE per day or 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year. Production results, of course, would have been even better had it not been for the loss of about 6,000 BOE per day due to the January freezes that we experienced. Oil production in the Permian was solid as well, 170,000 BOE per day. We're right on target with regard to our annual expectations for POPs. We put on production 63 wells in the quarter. The overall company production was 312,000 BOE per day.","We continue to maintain the strongest balance sheet in the energy sector, with about $1.8 billion of cash on hand. And as a result, we continue to have very low debt statistics.","I'll turn now to slide 4. A hot topic among investors and analysts, as many of you know, continues to be oil and gas takeaway capacity and their impact on differentials. In particular, we've seen a pretty significant blowout when it comes to the Midland-Cushing [Mid-Cush] differential and also from the standpoint of gas at the Waha differentials. I can very clearly state to you that Pioneer is in excellent shape in this regard due to the fact we have extensive firm transportation [FT] agreements for both oil and gas.","Toward that end, we delivered about 160,000 barrels a day of oil to the Gulf Coast under FT contracts during the quarter. Of that, about 87,000 was exported. And about three-quarters of our gas is sold under pipelines contracts, FT contracts, into Southern California, and it's priced along the lines of that market. The balance is sold under term contracts at Waha. But what that has done is allow us to make sure that our volumes will continue to flow uninterrupted and at strong realized prices. And Rich will have a couple more slides with some granularity on that in his section. But what it has allowed us to do also is to add value. And in this case, in the first quarter we added about $16 million of incremental cash flow related to our sales to the Gulf Coast and exports.","On the gas side, our realizations today are about $0.60 per Mcf higher due to the SoCal sales than they would be if we were selling all the gas in basin. So not only is this allowing us to move volumes, but it's allowing us to add value in doing so.","We did during the quarter close on the sale of our Eagle Ford West package for $103 million. That's a very positive result for the company. And as promised late last year, we have included in our 2018 compensation program for our management team the incorporation of return on capital employed, ROCE measures, as well as per share production and reserve targets, and you'll see those as we progress through the year. Albeit relatively small, we also began our stock repurchase program with $17 million of stock purchased in the first quarter.","Turning now to slide 5 and continuing the update for 2018, the plan remains very solid. Again, it's based on a D&C program that's focused on very high rate of return wells. We continue to operate 20 rigs in the basin and continue to have a POP schedule of 250 to 275 wells. By all third-party accounts, we continue to be drilling the most productive and high rate of return wells in the basin where we operate.","Cash margins are strong. IRRs continue to be strong. In essence, our returns are excellent, especially in light of the gains we've seen in oil prices during the first quarter and into April and in early May as well. We are evaluating adding some more rigs here at the end of 2018 as to progress our plan into 2019. We'll have more details on that as the year progresses.","We're on schedule to place our 45 Version 3.0+ completions online. These are the higher intensity completions that were planned for the year. We have some later slides to show what the impact of 3.0+ has done to the well results. Needless to say, the results have been stellar. And as a result, we're evaluating the concept of adding new 3.0+ wells to our schedule in the second half of the year based on the stellar results that we've already seen to date. I'll talk more about that in just a minute.","In terms of the Wolfcamp D, we have now on production the three wells we had planned. These wells have just been put on production and are cleaning up. But from what we've seen so far, we expect them to be excellent wells. You'll recall that our first higher intensity completion Wolfcamp D well had outstanding results and, as shown on the slide, delivered 130-day cume production of 260,000 BOE per day, really an outstanding well. I think these next three could be equally as good.","Finally on the slide, we are executing on our plan to appraise the Middle Spraberry Shale, the Jo Mill, and the Lower Spraberry Shale in terms of its pending future development. The idea here is to evaluate the proper spacing of the wells, the staggering and sequencing of the wells, and the proper stimulations on the wells in three separate development areas to optimize future locations that we'll be drilling and future production. So this is an appraisal concept that we can learn from and then optimize wells when we get out into next year with a true development plan in those three zones.","Now turning to the next slide, that's slide 6. We have made good progress in terms of our divestiture packages for both the Eagle Ford and the other assets that are in that package. Bids are expected during May for the Eagle Ford package, which would be the largest of those.","After all the divestitures are completed, of course, we become a pure play in the Permian Basin, in fact, a pure Midland Basin player. And that will enhance our reported returns because, of course, our reported cash margins will increase, our cash revenue per BOE, our operating costs will be reduced per BOE, and our corporate returns will also be significantly improved. So this is important for us to accomplish. I think it can easily last through the majority of this year to execute and actually complete all of these sales. But suffice it to say it's on the front burner and we're making good progress.","We're continuing to forecast that Permian production will grow about 19% to 24% this year. And based on the strong performance we saw in the first quarter and the success that I mentioned regarding our Version 3.0+ wells, we now expect that production will be trending towards the high end of that range.","Now turning to capital, cash out the door for D&C was just over $800 million in the quarter. Of course, we knew going into 2018 that we have somewhat of a front-loaded CapEx schedule, mostly as a result of the high intensity 3.0+ fracs that we had planned and a higher majority of deeper wells in the plan as well as longer laterals being concentrated in the first half of the year. Much of our 2018 seismic work as well as well science and pad construction was also planned for the first half. Additionally, some of our capital spilled over from the fourth quarter into the first quarter in terms of carryovers.","So it's also the case as we look out to the future and as other Permian operators have reported, we're starting to see some early signs of inflation late in the first quarter into April and May. It's a product, of course, of strong industry activity levels, especially in the Permian Basin, that are coupled with the high oil prices that we've seen in the high $60s.","And looking forward and based on the results I mentioned and the high returns of those 3.0+ wells that I just discussed, and I'll show you a slide in a moment, it is likely we'll increase the number of these completions going into the second half. We expect these wells to add to and contribute to our ongoing capital efficiency improvements. This would be money well spent.","As I also mentioned, it's likely we'll also add a couple of rigs later in the year to prepare us for the 2019 plan. And as a result of those two factors and the prospect of potential inflation that I mentioned, especially if oil prices and activity in the industry remain high, it's likely that our capital budget for this year of $2.9 billion will be increased.","I would also \u2013 I believe we'll have a better handle on that, of course, and the magnitude of the increase as we let more time pass. But probably around midyear we'll have a much better handle on exactly where that number will land. In any case, our intent is to spend within our forecasted cash flow, which is now projected at $3.2 billion, and to get again to that free cash flow generative model as soon as we can.","And finishing up on this slide, we did repay earlier this week our debt maturity of $450 million from cash.","Turning to slide 7, this is the slide I've been referring to, which covers results from our 3.0+ well campaign. And without going into the details by zone, you can readily see on this slide that the performance of the 36 Version 3.0+ wells we put on production already \u2013 these are in various areas and zones across the basin \u2013 over the past year have been excellent.","The wells, of course, utilize higher intensity completions. In that case, we mean more sand and more water. And they continue to really materially outperform Version 3.0 wells. And you can see on these graphs, it's somewhere between 30% to 40% at a minimum in general, and in some cases up to 100%. So the designs, when it comes to the higher intensity completions, are paying out easily in less than a year and they're generating high returns, not only for the incremental dollars, but they're increasing the returns on the wells in general. And as I mentioned a minute ago, additional 3.0+ wells are likely in the second half of the year because we've just seen this impressive performance to date.","I think also it's a fact that the 3.0+ wells with the kind of results they've shown have meaningfully increased our productivity per well. And as a result of that, overall production, as shown on the next slide, slide 8, reflects that. You can see here that it's pretty clear that 3.0+ wells are leading us to a position where we're reaching the top end of our guidance range, not only in the first quarter, but it supports our view that we're trending toward the high end of our guidance range of 24% for the year.","And importantly, I would say also that the high return on these wells gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our longer-term objectives, which are further captured on the next slide, slide 9. This is essentially reiterating our plan for enhancing shareholder value. First and foremost, it's based on a long-term focus on returns, both at the well level and then further too at the corporate level; in other words, strong returns on capital employed.","Capital discipline and capital efficiency are important parts of that because they drive strong growth and growth within cash flow. Eventually, this kind of discipline and efficiency leads to a return of capital to shareholders, which is of course an important part of our plan going forward. And it's critical in association with this that we also have a very strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility to execute the plan really in any reasonable price scenario.","And finally, the message from the Permian Basin assets is significant since it's highly repeatable. It's low risk. It's process-based, and it's going to be many decades of drilling. Fundamentally, our assets give us an advantage in the Permian Basin on the basis that they give us an opportunity to drill not only high return wells, but also increase our ability to return capital to shareholders.","So now I'm going to pass this over to Rich, and he's going to be discussing with you more granularity on the benefits from FT on both oil and gas as well as his review of the financials.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Good morning and thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on slide 10 and talk about our firm transportation of oil to the Gulf Coast.","If you look at the upper left figure there, you can see the pipelines that we have firm transportation onto the Gulf Coast. And we send about a third of our volumes to each of those locations, being Corpus Christi, Houston, and Nederland.","If you look at the upper right bar chart, as Tim mentioned, we did send about 160,000 barrels a day of oil to the Gulf Coast, or about 95% of our net production was there, which was all sold at Brent-related pricing. Of that 160,000 barrels a day, 87,000 was exported during the quarter, and we forecast a similar amount to be exported in the second quarter. However, we do anticipate as we move to the second half of the year that we'll be able to export essentially 100% of our volumes once a new export facility comes online in the Houston market late this summer.","As Tim mentioned, we did benefit by $16 million of incremental cash flow associated with our sales to the Gulf Coast. That equates after transportation to about $1 a barrel. So clearly we are deriving benefits from our firm transportation today, but it even gets better as we move into the second quarter, especially when you think about what's happened with Mid-Cush differentials.","Just as a point of reference, Mid-Cush differentials averaged $0.40 for the first quarter. In April they averaged $5.15, and at the end of April they were $7. So we should see a significant uplift in our cash provided by moving these volumes to the Gulf Coast in the second quarter relative to what we saw in the first quarter.","Longer term, we are continuing to target to be at 90% or more of our production moving to the Gulf Coast. We've structured our firm transportation contracts such that they ramp up over the next three years to match our production growth profile. And so we're in good shape through 2020, early 2021. And then at that point, we'll start layering on more on top of those FT contracts that run out to the mid-2020s. So suffice it to say that we're essentially insulated from Mid-Cush differentials and, really by moving our barrels to the Gulf Coast, really provide a substantial uplift to the company's cash flow going forward.","Turning to slide 11 and looking at our gas position, similar to oil, we are well positioned with FT contracts to move about 75% of our gas to the Southern California market, where we're selling it at a premium to Waha prices. And significant, as Tim mentioned, we're basically today about a $0.60 uplift compared to Waha, where that's about equivalent to $2 million to $3 million per month of incremental revenues. The remaining 25% is sold at Waha under term contracts, so we do have firm contracts to sell that gas in Waha.","So in total, we have basically demonstrated that we have the assurance that we can move our gas either to Southern California or that we have contracts to sell it in Waha because we've recently taken on extra capacity on Kinder Morgan's Gulf Coast Express Pipeline. That is expected to come on in late 3Q of 2019, and that will give us access to LNG exports, where we've already actually locked up some contracts, refineries, petrochemical facilities, and actually be able to export into Mexico as well. So overall, we are in great shape to ensure our gas moves out of the basin into better pricing markets and that it can have flow assurance during that time period.","I guess the one thing having said all that is gas revenue still is a small portion of our total revenue stream, so it's less than 5% of our forecasted Permian Basin revenue. But it is important that we have flow assurance, and we think we've done a good job of positioning ourselves to make sure all our gas flows.","Turning to slide 12, the earnings summary, net income attribute to common stockholders was $178 million or $1.04 per diluted share. It did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses of $106 million after tax or $0.62, really related to the increase in oil prices over the quarter. So adjusting for that item, we are at $284 million or $1.66 per diluted share. So it was really another great quarter operationally and financially.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, you can see how we did relative to guidance. On a production basis, we were at the upper end of our guidance range at 312,000 BOEs a day. On the production cost, which I'll talk more about later, the $10.30 per BOE does reflect the new revenue recognition standard that I'll talk about it more in a minute. So there's $1.53 per BOE in that number associated with the new revenue recognition.","Exploration and abandonments came in at $35 million. Those really, as Tim mentioned, are front-end loaded seismic that we had going on in the first half of the year, so that's included in there. We had some 3-D seismic surveys. And then really the rest of these items are fairly consistent with where we would have expected them to be, so I'll move to slide 13.","So slide 13 gives an overview of our new revenue recognition standard. And so similar to what you've heard from other companies in the earnings season that we've been in, we adopted this new standard effective January 1. And for Pioneer, this is just a geography change with no impact to cash margins. Essentially, we had gas processing fees, fractionation fees, and transportation fees for NGL and gas that was netted out of revenue. Under the new rules, it no longer will be netted out of revenue, but instead we'll record it in production costs.","So if you look at the bottom of the page on the right-hand side, you can see that the impact of that for the first quarter was a $1.53 per BOE increase related to NGL sales and gas sales and a $1.53 increase in production costs, for no net change in our cash margins.","Turning to slide 14, where we talk about price realizations, on this slide we have adjusted to make them comparable our prior periods per NGL and gas revenues price realizations to put them on a comparable basis. So if you look at the bar charts now, you can see that oil was up 17% quarter over quarter. As we also have seen with the oil price increase, we participated in that. NGLs on a comparable basis were up 1%, so not much change there. And gas prices were down 7% quarter over quarter from a price realization standpoint. At the bottom of the chart, you can see our derivatives impact and what they would have had to our realization, so they're there for your benefit.","Turning to slide 15, and similar to the prior slide, we have adjusted prior periods to make them comparable for the revenue recognition standard. And so adjusting for that, you'll see that production costs for the first quarter were up 13%. You'll see that each of the categories were up slightly, but the two main drivers for it was higher oil prices, which caused production taxes and ad valorem taxes to be higher quarter over quarter. And then we did see some increase in LOE, mainly related to activity levels in the Permian Basin, so higher labor costs, and then, associated with commodity price increases, higher fuel and hot oil rates, so those two are the main components of the increase.","Turning to slide 16, looking at our liquidity position, Tim said it already, excellent financial condition for the company, one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, $900 million of net debt at the end of the first quarter, plenty of capacity under our credit facility with nothing drawn. And as Tim mentioned, we did repay our May 1 debt maturity of $450 million earlier this week with cash on hand, so still in excellent financial condition.","Turning to slide 17 and really focusing now on second quarter guidance, you can see here from a production standpoint we're forecasting total corporate production of 312,000 to 322,000 BOEs per day. That does reflect all of our existing assets. If we close some of these divestitures we hope to prior to quarter end, obviously, that would come out of our production numbers and report them into the second quarter. Permian Basin production is forecasted at 268,000 to 276,000 BOEs per day. The rest of these items are consistent with prior quarters for the most part, so I'll leave them for you to go through.","And at that point, I'll turn it back to you, April, to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll first here from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Tim, I wanted to clarify a little bit about your comments on the guidance and CapEx. The first question really relating to the guidance, you mentioned that the company is tracking towards the upper end of the 19% to 24% Permian Basin growth range. Does that just contemplate the 45 Version 3.0+?","And I guess my follow-up is just on that. If you did increase the mix of Version 3.0+ wells, would you expect there to be a corresponding impact to production from that?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks Arun. I think first of all, the production numbers we're seeing so far have been outstanding, and we continue to operate at a strong rate of growth. So I think the numbers we're reflecting today really don't yet contemplate adding additional 3.0+ because we haven't determined that number yet.","What I'm pointing you to is the fact that we are going to increase the number of 3.0+. And as a result, we'll come out with production guidance at that time. But needless to say, one of the reasons we're hitting the top end of our range is because of 3.0+. The more we drill, the better we're going to do.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, great. And just to clarify your comments on CapEx, you mentioned that CapEx would likely trend higher. You'll update the Street in the middle part of the year. But you did mention that while it could be higher than $2.9 billion, did you mention that it could be less than $3.2 billion, which is your current cash flow? I just wanted to get a sense of what the potential magnitude of the CapEx increase is related to inflation adding some rigs, for 2019 growth, et cetera.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","To determine the exact number of rigs we're going to add, yes, so that number is unclear. We have not exactly finalized the 3.0+ number of additions as well, so we don't really have a number in mind yet. And we also aren't really clear on where this inflation thing ends up. We can point you to several categories where we can say what the current estimate it would be for inflation. But there are so many moving parts that we've got to get our arms around that. So rather than saying it's going to be $3.1 billion or $3.2 billion or any particular number, you've got to give us some time to really sort out what's going to happen in all of these parameters.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks a lot, good results.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh my goodness. Good morning, Tim. It's Doug Leggate.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Doug, you're now Italian, it sounds like.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My wife will take that all day long. Frank, it's been a real pleasure. I wish you the best of luck. I hope to see you down in Naples some time. Thanks for all your help.","Tim, I guess the question that hasn't been asked in a while is the cadence of infrastructure spending. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit of guidance as to how we should think about that going forward as you step into this next phase of growth, especially with some of these bigger wells. Do you still anticipate the breakeven trending down to that $50 and then ultimately $40 level? But I'm really more interested in the next couple of years. And I've got a quick follow-up please.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","First of all, on your question regarding the cadence of incremental spending above just D&C, we have some significant projects this year that you're familiar with. One of them is our Midland wastewater plant investment, so as to them being able to take 240,000 barrels a day of effluent water from the system. That's easily $100 million-plus this year we think that's going to be spent later as we get into the year, in addition to which we have regular capital needs for our pumping services fleet as well as other items corporately.","The other thing to note is we do continue to spend money on a relatively even cadence on tank batteries and saltwater disposal systems. Our estimate continues to be that by the end of this year, we'll be about 65% completed on the whole field-wide implementation of that, so we do have a few more years of spending at that level.","Our longer-term modeling is to add roughly $300 million per year. When we put out our 10-year plan, that was the number we included. And it could be a combination of things. It could be gas processing. We have two gas processing plants coming in this year, two coming in next year. So this is an important part of our capital in the sense that it prepares us for the long term.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate that. Obviously, it's something that comes up periodically. We just wanted to make sure we had it baked into our numbers.","My follow-up is really more about the longer-term target, the impact of the asset sales on that target. And if I can risk a third leg to that question, any updated thoughts on what you do with the proceeds of the pending asset sales because, obviously, it's a fairly meaningful number. Do you stick with the million and10? Do you make up the difference with some of these bigger wells, for example? And I'm guessing you've got a lot of flexibility in there. Just if you could frame that for us. Then I'll let someone else jump in.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, Doug, thanks. Yeah, we do have a lot of flexibility. But I would point out to you that if we were to spend no money on those assets in the next 8.5 years that remain on the plan, they would basically get to a point where they're insignificant as to their contribution. That's certainly the way we have it modeled. So therefore, in the fullness of time, even if we kept those assets and didn't spend money on them, they would be immaterial to the ultimate goal of reaching that goal in 8.5 years.","And so asset sales are really not meaningful. They would be meaningful in a quarter or two here and there but not in the long term, simply because they asymptotically reach zero in terms of production over 8 years. So that's important. So I don't think the asset sales really have much to do with it.","As to the use of the cash, right now we're planning on trying to execute on these sales. We don't have any particular plans for that cash per se. It will be part of our calculus when we start focusing on the 2019 plan, and in particular the notion of return of capital to shareholders as we get to where we're cash flow generative.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a quick bolt-on for Rich. When you sell those assets, what happens to the other expense line, Rich? Does that roll off with those assets? Specifically, I'm talking about the MBC costs.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, the vast majority of it will roll off once they're sold, so there should be very little left at that point.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks so much, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","John Freeman of Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Freeman.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First off, I'd also like to share my congratulations, Frank, on your retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years and I certainly wish you and Eileen all the best.","My first question, as you all are now contemplating these additional rig adds, you all previously talked about considering revamping and renovating a couple of your frac fleets. And I'm just wondering if there's been any decision made on that front.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, John, first of all, the fleets \u2013 we have one or two fleets that probably need some refurbing. One in particular is really on ice today, and that was something we have to evaluate really for as a late 2018-2019 decision, realizing today of course we're using, depending upon the day, six or seven of our own fleets and one outside fleet. The calculus is such that we need about one fleet for every three rigs. So let's say, for example, we were at 24 rigs at any particular time, we would need eight fleets. So we're within the bandwidth. We might just refurb one of ours or bring in a third party. We're evaluating it. It's sort of a lease versus buy decision. Going further, though, we'd have to make that decision in a bigger sense. That really becomes a 2020 issue, so we'd have to make the decision really in 2019.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, that's helpful. And then just my one follow-up question, just to make sure that I'm thinking about the export market and what you all have done a great job on in terms of the Gulf Coast, basically, the last couple quarters it looks like now for 2Q you all are going to be trending around that 90,000 barrel a day export number, and I recognize you all are expanding the capacity to 150,000. But am I thinking about it right? With the 160,000 or so right now that's going to the Gulf Coast, it's almost indifferent for you all whether you export or whether you sell it to the Gulf Coast refining. You're basically just doing whatever is going to give you the highest value, right?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's correct. Other than some of the Gulf Coast sales are term in nature. They're not really very long-term but they might be for 3 months, for example, something like that, or 6 months. The rest of the export sales as it relates to today are all spot sales. So you have to wire around whatever you have in terms of term contracts. But overall you're right. Our whole objective is just to send it to the highest market.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect, great quarter, guys. Thanks again.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","We'll now hear from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Frank, congratulations again. Tim, you highlighted the return of capital to shareholders over time. At the same time, at least for now, you're talking about using the cash flow from strip prices for greater CapEx. I fully recognize the benefits of the rate of return from enhanced completions. But how do you and the board view the near-term preference for return on capital by redeploying the potentially $300 million from strip prices to the drill bit versus an earlier than expected return of capital to shareholders?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think first of all, I'm very confident when I say the returns on this incremental spending are very, very high in the sense of the 3.0+ wells. The adding of rigs really is a matter of cadence, keeping the RPMs upward and to the right as we execute on our plans. So it's just then a matter of exactly what that additional capital entails.","2018, of course, is a year where we're relatively high in terms of derivatives, which have an effect to us of not getting the full benefit of the high prices. And so had we not been as hedged as we are today, we'd actually be in that mode today. In 2019, our derivative packages are significantly lower. In 2020 we're completely un-hedged. And so the numbers actually jump off the page at you when you take that into consideration.","And so we have not changed our plan in any way whatsoever. We're trying to get to cash flow generative positions as fast as we can while executing at a high rate of return on the capital invested. And this really doesn't change anything regarding our long-term objectives in that regard.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then with regards to the potential to add 3.0+ completions, on one of your slides, slide 7, you show the well performance \u2013 or outperformance of the 3.0+ across different areas. Can you add a little bit more color where you would expect to be increasing relative to your initial case the 3.0+? Is it disproportionately some areas versus another, and how differentiated should we expect you to be?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Brian, what I'll do is I'll let Joey answer that question.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","This is Joey. Whenever we look at our completion recipes across the field, the way you asked the question is exactly the way the result comes out. One size definitely does not fit all, as I mentioned many times in the past. And I would say as we continue to expand the 3.0+ completions, that applies as well. So it's going to be across the board in different areas based on what kind of stacking plan we have, what kind of frac barriers we have. So it's going to vary. And I couldn't really characterize it geographically because it just varies so greatly across the field.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","The only thing to add there is if you look at what we set out in slide 7, these walls are all over the place, where we've shown you the uplifts from 3.0+ wells. We expect that to continue. They're going to be spread throughout the field.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Bob Morris of Citi.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you and nice quarter, gentlemen. Tim, last year you added two rigs to build the DUC inventory as a cushion as you move forward. Where does that DUC inventory build stand at this point? And going forward, is that something you just maintain for cushion going into the future, or at some point do you try to draw down that inventory?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think the objective, of course, by adding the two rigs was to move our DUC inventory into a position where we would not be subjected to any rig-induced delays. The objective is to hit a target of about 30 DUCs in the second half of this year. So we're building in that direction. The second quarter is an important period during which we're building the DUCs, at which point, in essence, that DUC build will have been completed, we feel comfortable at that level, and then we just essentially are turning those rigs to production at that point.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the second question is last quarter you moved down about 50% of your drilling program still using the four-string casing, but I know you were looking at a deeper disposal well to the Ellenberger. You were looking at recycling. You were looking at spreading out the drilling C1 pressure up that upper zone. How is that progressing as far as continuing to move that percentage down on the four-string casing design to then further improve the efficiencies going forward?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, we are now averaging, depending on the exact time period, look at 45% to 50% four-string case wells, so we're hitting our target there really well in that sense. But we have a lot of initiatives going on as well, as you might expect. We're planning on five Ellenberger wells this year. The first well was spudded here at the end of the first quarter.","The anticipation also, though, is that we would increase substantially the amount of produced water that we use. The rates were more in the 5% to 10% last year. We're heading more, hopefully quickly, to 15% to 20%. Ultimately, that's a very important objective because reutilizing the produced water is a significant economic benefit because we already paid for it. Now we're just going to reuse it by cleaning it up a little bit. But also taking that water out from underneath our drilling footprint is important when it comes to this business of four-string versus three-string. So we've got a lot of initiatives moving forward, and they're all on target.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Michael Hall with Heikkinen. So I guess I'm just curious if you could provide just some color on sensitivities on how the cash flow benefit from your marketing arrangements looks as we move into what looks like a much wider spread in the back half of the year. Maybe just provide what's the cost to get from Midland to the coast. And then what sort of handling fees are you paying on the export barrels from the coast to Brent, so we can work out a sensitivity on that?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure, Michael. So roughly call it $2.00 to $2.50 a barrel on average to get the volumes to the Gulf Coast, and then there's usually call it $0.50 or so between storage and getting it on the water for export. So you're all-in in that $2.50 to $3.00 range on the transport cost per barrel. And then depending on where the Mid-Cush differential is, what that uplift will ultimately be and how much incremental cash flow that is relative to what we would have gotten had we sold it in Midland, it is really highly dependent on where the Mid-Cush differential is. Generally, we've been receiving on a Brent versus WTI basis 70% to 80% of that differential as an uplift over WTI.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And you have obviously good foresight in building out I guess the portfolio you have as it relates to the marketing side of the business. Do you have any views on how sustained you think this tightness ends up being? Do you think the pipes that are planned for the back half of 2019 will resolve the situation, or do you think this is something that will likely drag out beyond that, and then additional infrastructure builds beyond what we've seen announced will be required in 2020 and beyond?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think if you look at the numbers, we do expect to be pretty tight. This doesn't apply to us because we have FT.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","But in general, new pipelines aren't expected to come on until the later part of 2019. There are three or four specific pipelines heading to Corpus in particular. So it could be pretty tight between now and then. And so as a result, I would guess that you will have a wider Mid-Cush differential during that period than you would otherwise would have if those pipelines were in.","But that said, it's simply the case that we're going to need more pipelines through time. So it pretty clearly will take 18 months, two years or so to build new pipelines. And it's very possible new pipelines will be announced with the idea of startup dates into 2020 and 2021. For our purposes, we're pretty much covered in terms of FT ramping up into 2021-2022 ourselves, so we don't really have an issue, but certainly it could be tight.","If you look at the gas side of the equation, it also will be tight, we feel like, in the short term. The short term means end of 2019, in particular when the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline comes on with two Bcf a day to clear out of the Permian market, realizing that Permian gas growth substantially just mirrors oil growth. And so this is going to be something that has to be grappled with. But again, with our Southern California market, we're pretty much not exposed to that issue in any significant way.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that's helpful, and kudos for being in front of all that. If I could, one more thing. On the capital side, I'm just curious. How much in the first quarter was spent on infrastructure? Sorry if I missed that in the disclosures. I didn't see it. And then what in the first quarter I guess would you characterize as somewhat transitory or could rate down over the course of the year? And if you could, the expected level of spending in the second quarter would be helpful.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Infrastructure spending for the first quarter, it was in aggregate about $35 million of our expected $250 million, so it was a little bit under our run rate. I don't have the exact numbers on the second quarter to give you, but my guess is it's probably in that $50 million range or so, I would suspect.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. I was thinking \u2013 full corporate capital spending in 2Q is what I was trying to get that.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Not just infrastructure.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","We really haven't got the number for you right now, but I think I would anticipate that certain things would come out of the capital budget that were in the first quarter. For instance, we had about $30 million that was carried over from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. That's inexact. So we won't see the seismic in there.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Or the 3.0+ completions.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's right. We've done more 3.0+ stop (46:47) completions in the first quarter than there are in the second. So from that standpoint, we had science on wells that were significant. All of those things don't reoccur.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, I appreciate the color, guys, and congrats, Frank.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tim, to you and your team there.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a question about pad size. It seems like there's a trend in the industry among your Permian peers going towards bigger pads and big multiple pads. And I know in the past you guys had settled on a three-well pad as the optimum. But I wonder if you could give us an update on your thinking there and talk about what are some of the trade-offs that you look at as you look moving to bigger pads.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Okay, I'm going to pass that one to Joey Hall for you, Charles.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Charles, we actually started instituting last year what we call the Pioneer pad. And it's a 24-well pad, which reduced our footprint to about a quarter of an acre per well, which is an 85% reduction. And the whole premise behind that is that we plan on 24 wells in all multiple benches for any particular area for the full field development, so that we plan our wells smartly and we don't leave any reservoir behind by limiting ourselves on surface. I would say about 50% of our program this year is on these big pads, and then of course, as you start going into the stack rate test, and we have someone other tests planned later this year and early next year where we'll be doing some similar multi-well pad developments.","So Pioneer has been doing this for quite some time. And on these multi-well pads, we're able to drill, produce, and complete all on the same pad, so a lot of simultaneous operations. So yes, we've been doing that since last year.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Just to clarify that, Joey, you don't necessarily drill all 24 before you frac and flow back. Am I interpreting that right?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, to put it in perspective, and I'll give you the best example I can. For example, on a 24-well pad, we'll put in a well bay for six wells. And in general, what you would see us doing right now is we would come in and drill the three Wolfcamp Bs and then get those online. And then once they're online, we'd come back in and drill three Wolfcamp As. And for the most part, that's what we're doing now. So the additional 18 well bays would put in in six packages each and those wells would be drilled in subsequent years.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then, Tim, if I could go back to that takeaway question, you guys have really been ahead of the curve of the industry, not just on this takeaway but also on a lot of these infrastructure and macro things. I'm curious. There's talk of a VLCC port going in at Corpus Christi. I'm curious, is that going to have any effect on you as a Permian producer with FT, or is that something that's all just going to affect things downstream with you?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think if you're speaking of Ingleside, for example, which is Oxy's terminal there, they can already berth VLCCs, but they can only half-load them, let's say, because of the draft limitations in the bay there. And so what's being contemplated is a very significant project to do dredging to allow VLCCs to actually be not only brought into berth but to be also fully laden.","What's happening now is the VLCCs are half-loaded and they're brought off into deeper water and there's additional oil that's brought out to \u2013 lightered out to the vehicle to load it up before it heads, for example, to Asia. So what this will do, and this is better for you to direct to Oxy, but it will reduce our costs and time significantly.","And so those are all advantages, especially when you're just looking at cargo economics in terms of their deliveries into, for example, China or South Korea, what have you. I think we have fundamentally a lower cost basis because we don't have to fool around with lightering oil out to a VLCC.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you for that color, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Bob Brackett of Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. I appreciate that less than 5% of Permian revenue is gas. So in a sense, flow assurance is more of a strategic issue than maybe a financial one. Can you talk about what goes wrong when you lack gas flow assurance in the basin and what some of those fallback plans might look like?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think one of the issues is that we would be limited on flaring, I feel like, in the basin, just as a general rule. Certainly out of corporate conduct and doing the right thing environmentally, we would want to as an industry not be flaring gas in any significant quantity for any significant period of time. That would be something that might be an issue.","What it could potentially lead to if flaring were not to be an option for the reasons I mention is shutting in some old wells that are relatively low oil producers and gassier producers that were old vertical wells for instance. So you could actually have an effect on production if in fact this situation became so acute that we were having \u2013 not we per se \u2013 but as an industry reduce gas production from vertical wells. Now again, as you mention, it's not a significant or material revenue effect, but it is one of the ways to solve the issue.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You might have to, longer term, consider reinjection as well.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","What would reinjection do to something like OpEx?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's still too early to tell. It's a lot of work still has to be done on that and it depends on the location. It's going to be important on that too.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, there's other options too in terms of using gas within the facilities, using gas, for example, to run frac fleets, drilling rigs, and so on. There's a lot of different options. Hopefully we don't need \u2013 we're not pressed into those solutions, however.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Tim, my question is you guys have been always not only about the takeaway way in advance, but in vertical integration. I'm just wondering, as you look at now what's going on in the industry, are you continuing to add more on the vertical integration side, either through sand or frac or perhaps even rigs, anything you could talk there just what you all are doing?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Neal. I did mention earlier that the decision regarding our frac fleet in the future in terms of adding to it is simply a buy versus lease decision, and that's something under evaluation. It has to do with a lot of factors. We are very confident that having our own frac fleets gives us a very significant advantage in terms of execution. And so that's something we'll being evaluating. Again, it's not a decision for this year. It's more of a decision for next year on my 3-to-1 ratio argument.","In terms of sand, right now we are in fact taking our first quantities of Western sand. That's relatively low quantity today. We're talking about ramping that up to 1.5 million or 2 million tons per year, starting potentially next year. That's under consideration today. So Western sands could be significant. Now, our ownership would not really be the factor here. It would just be getting processed sand at relatively low cost. So we don't see necessarily vertically integrating per se into more sand today than we currently have.","When you look at things like water, our water system is critical. I mentioned the fact that this Midland contract and the Midland construction project is significant in the sense it gives us massive quantities of effluent water. That project has to move ahead.","So some areas we're evaluating it; some areas are clear we're moving ahead, in particular on water. Sand, we're moving more to the Western areas since it can save us considerable amounts on our well cost. So it's really a mixed bag. We are continuing to invest in gas processing with our partner, Targa. They've done a great job keeping up with the gas production growth in the basin, and I anticipate they'll continue to do so.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good, and then one just follow-up if I could. You had success, I think it was on even in the last quarter talking about just the Wolfcamp D success you had there on \u2013 I think it was on the eastern Midland, as I recall. Are you seeing advancements there when you go to the 3.0+ just as you were seeing in the other zones? Is there now just as much plan to drill as many Wolfcamp Ds as there was , or is the focus more still on (55:45)?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I'll let Joey answer that question, Neal.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, just to be clear, whenever we drilled that last Wolfcamp D well, that was an upgrade to 3.0, and so we saw a significant uptick. And the last three wells that we recently POP'd this quarter are also 3.0. So as we highlighted last quarter, it had been some time since we had done any Wolfcamp D wells, so our completion recipes had evolved significantly.","One of the things I would say we're most pleased about in the Wolfcamp D is that we've had great success drilling these wells and also great success completing these wells because since they are deeper, they do offer some additional challenges, but we're seeing great execution of these wells.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Nice, thanks for the details, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes.","Operator","And our final question for today will come from Leo Mariani of NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","Hey, guys, just a quick follow-up here on the asset sales. I think you guys talked in your prepared comments about potentially getting some proceeds in maybe by the end of 2Q. I just wanted to get a little bit more color there. Is this just some of the smaller dribs and drabs, and is the larger Eagle Ford package more of a year-end target? I'm just trying to get a sense of those proceeds.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Leo, sure. I think first of all, the Eagle Ford package, as I mentioned earlier in the slides, we're anticipating bids on that during May. As it goes, there's time then for negotiation and discussion of who would be the purchaser we would want to negotiate with. Negotiations would continue. It will reach a point where a purchase and sale agreement would be signed, and then processing all the way to a closing. It's obviously several months away, so it's a complex process. And as a result, I would not expect to see any proceeds on that really for months until we actually finalize it.","The other two assets in question, that being Raton and West Panhandle field, those are smaller. They are such that we might be able to achieve something faster on those, but those data rooms are really in effect open and we're processing the opportunity to get bids on those pretty shortly as well. So the latter two pretty clearly can be faster. The first of the three, that being Eagle Ford, is going to take time.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. I really appreciate it. And, Frank, once again, thanks for all you've done for us. We'll be on the road here a little bit during May and June. I look forward to seeing you there. I hope everybody has a great summer, and we'll be updating you when that time comes.

More specifically, today's agenda will first have Scott provide the financial and operating highlights for the fourth quarter of 2012. He will then review our capital program for 2013, our production growth outlook and the extremely encouraging results we are seeing from our horizontal drilling program in the Permian.","After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will discuss our horizontal drilling plans in the Permian, both in the southern Wolfcamp joint interest area and across Pioneer's extensive northern Wolfcamp\/Spraberry acreage position. He will also update you on Spraberry vertical, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale Combo and Alaska operations.","Rich will then cover the fourth quarter financials in more detail and provide earnings guidance for the first quarter. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Thanks, Frank. Good morning. I'll start off on the financial and operating highlights on Slide #3. The fourth quarter, we had adjusted income of about $107 million or $0.83 per adjusted share.","Production, including the Barnett by bringing them back in from discontinued operations, fourth quarter of 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Without Barnett, we were at the midpoint of our guidance range at 156,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","For the full year, we've averaged 156,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, including the Barnett Shale production. It's up 29% for the year versus '11, which is at the top end of our full year guidance range.  We're also up 54% in oil growth over -- since 2011; the growth attributable to strong programs from the Spraberry vertical, horizontal Wolfcamp Shale program, the Eagle Ford and the Barnett Shale Combo drilling programs.","We released our funding cost and our reserve replacement just last week, delivered over 250% drillbit reserve replacement, 161 million BOEs at a drillbit F&D cost of a little less than $18 per BOE, $17.72.","We are initiating a $1 billion horizontal drilling appraisal program of Pioneer's northern Wolfcamp\/Spraberry acreage for 2013 and '14. $400 million of that is included in the 2013 drilling budget of $2.75 billion. The remainder is $600 million in 2014.","Long term -- short term for 2013, we're forecasting a production growth of 12% to 16%. If you look at the slide later on, we are backing out a sale to Sinochem about midyear a little bit over 4,000 barrels equivalent per day. That would have moved the rate up somewhere between 14% to 18% for the year of 2012 to 2013.","Long term, also using $85 flat price deck for WTI for the next 3 years up to $100 WTI flat for the next 3 years, we're targeting a 13% to 18% compounded annual growth rate from '13 to '15, and we'll go over more the backup for that when we get to the growth slide.","Slide #4, drilling highlights. Really, we feel like this is probably the most important quarter in the company's history for a couple items: One, we have brought on what we feel like matches our deal size maps, the best well in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the B interval in Midland County. That's essentially 1,700 barrels of equivalent per day and IP rate and a peak 20-day average flow rate of over 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 75% oil. This well is 25 miles north of our best 2 wells in the south in the Giddings horizontal Wolfcamp Shale wells, which we'll comment on later on and update on those wells.","Obviously, the second thing that happened during the quarter was putting a value on our southern acreage of $21,000 per acre and selling roughly about 10% of Pioneer's total Wolfcamp acreage position. And we announced a $1.74 billion transaction with Sinochem, and that transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we had tremendous results in our JV area with -- joint interest area with Sinochem. We drilled our first 10,000-foot lateral in the Upper B interval in Reagan County with an IP rate of a little over 1,200 barrels a day equivalent, with a peak 20-day average a little bit over 1,000, 80% oil. Also, if you recall, we've been showing you in our maps the last couple of quarters that the B interval is ticking up into the 500, 600-foot range that we're start -- we feel like that's going to take 2 wells to drill up the B interval. We drilled our first Lower B interval well, it came on; it's currently producing way above the 575,000 barrel type curve. And we've also drilled our best Wolfcamp Shale A interval well, which is the top of the Wolfcamp, also producing above that curve.  We're targeting -- we did achieve our targeted year-end '12 horizontal Wolfcamp Shale production of 5,000 barrels a day that we had brought up during the last quarter.","In addition, we increased our net resource potential, primarily from the Midland County well and the data that we have put together, up from 5.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent per day up to about 8 billion or greater than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent per day. And we'll comment on that as we get to the slide and talk about the backup that makes up those numbers.","Going to our capital budget. For 2013, we're announcing a capital program of $3 billion. That does include $2.75 billion from drilling capital and roughly $240 million from other items, which I'll talk about. We do have cash flow of roughly about $2 billion in an $85 market. $600 million will be coming in about mid-second quarter from the joint interest cash proceeds, then $400 million from capital markets. The primary expenditure obviously is in the Permian. We have $1.2 billion in the northern Wolfcamp\/Spraberry area, and the Spraberry area made up of the $400 million for the horizontal program; $625 million essentially for 15 rigs, vertical rigs running that are essentially holding leases that are on continuous development; and then $200 million for infrastructure automation. That does include solar disposal wells, additional gas processing plants and automation.","Eagle Ford, if you remember, the carry ran out last November, so the expenditure has increased  significantly. It is cash flowing the asset now, with the carry expiring more than our capital. We're at $575 million there. And then in the Barnett, we'll be running 2 rigs over the next 3 years with $185 million, with continued significant growth over the next 3 years.","The $240 million of other capital, as we have mentioned over the past several quarters, obviously, a big decrease in vertical integration. We're essentially -- are through building things out there of $25 million. We are expanding our sand mine up to $70 million to account for the significant increase in the horizontal Wolfcamp, both in the joint venture and also to the north, and then $145 million in buildings, field offices and others. That's again primarily mostly going to be pumping services, office, new offices and also field offices. And about $52 million of that is in a Midland building for our employees out in the north side of Midland.","Turning to Slide 6, and going over our growth rates and what makes up those growth rates. Again, we're targeting 13% to 18% compounded annual growth rate for the next 3 years. That's in the range of $85 oil flat for WTI to $100 oil flat for the next 3 years. Again, we do have the sale to Sinochem, a little bit over 400,000 barrels a day equivalent. We're estimating about June 1 on that, so that's why we have a lower 12% to 16% for 2013. Again, we end up about 60% liquids for fourth quarter going to 70% liquids for 2015.","In addition, we are not -- in this number, we are not modeling the HUD type curve, which the well came in 1,700 barrels a day. We are modeling in this growth profile essentially a 500,000 to 575,000 barrel type curve. So we are very, very conservative in regard to not using the HUD type well, which we expect more wells in that range as we ramp up the rig count to the northern appraisal program.","Going over a few of the details on our announcement in Midland County well on Slide #7. Again, we've outlined 3 critical items in this type curve. We have barrels of oil equivalent per day on the left side and time on the right.","Start off with an update on the Giddings wells. If you recall, they've been our 2 best wells in the northern part of our joint venture area to the south of 207,000 acres. The 2 wells, if you notice, they now have been put on our official lift, 1 pumping in at 1 gas lift. They're pouring -- they're starting to perform above the type curve, so above the 650 type curve. Those laterals were 5,300. 2013 drilling, we will focus a lot more wells in this area.","In addition, the HUD well to the north, it came on 1,700 barrels a day equivalent, averaged 1,500 barrels a day equivalent. That's essentially twice as much as the Giddings wells, so we obviously haven't put on a type curve. But obviously, it implies a significant increase way in above the Giddings for this HUD well. It also confirms our maps that our geoscientists have built over last 2 years.","In addition, we saw a 40% increase in the University well #4H, 10-1 #4H in our first 10,000-foot lateral. We have several more that are in the works at 9,000 to 10,000 feet. But this well came on 40% greater than the Giddings wells at a cost of about $1.6 million. So again, tremendous economics on all of these wells.","Going to the next slide, an update on our announcement last quarter of the horizontal Jo Mill. The Jo Mill is a sand that we've been perforating over the last 40 years in both the north and the southern acreage. We did drill 2 wells in northern Upton County. We announced them last quarter. An update on those, we normalized this. If you recall, they were drilled 2,500-foot laterals. We normalized it to 5,000-foot laterals, is what we expect to drill on our appraisal program to the north over the next 2 years. More of our wells are going to be in the 5,000-foot range in the Jo Mill and also in the Spraberry shales. But you can see, both of these wells are performing way above the 650 type curve. And also we expect the well cost to be probably $1 million, $1.5 million less as we drill in the Jo Mill and the Spraberry shales than in Wolfcamp. So again, we're very excited about this.","Going to Slide #9. This is one of our treasure maps that the geoscience team has built over the last 2 years, just indicating with thousands of wells -- hundreds of wells of core data and well log data, thousands of wells that we drilled in this area. So we have a lot of data points. So we have a lot more data points than just having 2 wells in Midland County. We do have the well located in the middle of Midland County, about 25 wells -- 25 miles north of the Giddings wells. In addition, we point out a third-party well that IP-ed at 890 barrels a day, not too far from our HUD wells on the western -- northwestern side of the Midland County with 3,700-foot lateral length.","We do have 2 wells up in Martin County. But you can look at the vast amount of acreages in what we call Tier 1. A lot of data went in to build this. We feel like with the higher reservoir pressure, the temperature, the better thermal maturity, higher organic content, which is the kerogen content, enables to show tremendous results going forward in this key area.","It's important to note that Tier 2, several wells have been drilled by us and other operators in Tier 2, and also expect it to be very productive and economic.","And finally, on Slide #10, an update on our resource potential. Our proved reserves have been update -- up to 1.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, both resources up over 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, over 40,000 drilling locations. But the big changes you'll see on the right side in the Wolfcamp play, obviously, we did sell -- from previous reported numbers, we did sell when we closed with Sinochem roughly about 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent when that closes. And so our southern area obviously went down with that sell. Our northern area obviously is continuing to go up. The key here is we're only using roughly 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent to come up with our estimates of the 3 billion barrels in the north. We're not including any Spraberry shales, the 2 Spraberry shales, both the middle and the lower Spraberry shales, and we're also not including any downspacing. All this is calculated on 140-acre spacing. We are drilling our Eagle Ford and our Barnett down to 70-acre spacing now, so we've got essentially double the upside in all of these key areas in regard to the resource potential.","Let me stop there now and turn it over to Tim to talk more details about the budget and operations.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. On the next several slides, I'm going to try to give you some granularity on our activities in our main areas of drilling.","And first, I'm going to focus on the southern Wolfcamp joint interest area. It's, of course, the subject of the recently announced signing of the agreement with Sinochem. In that area we -- as shown on the map, we've drilled some important wells. Scott has already alluded to these wells. This was the first of the lower B wells, also the 10,000-foot lateral well he mentioned. That well has really been phenomenal. It's made 31,000 barrels in its first 34 days of production, so it's a phenomenal well. And then, of course, our first 6 -- one of our A wells is being very successful in that area as well. So the drilling campaign is doing exceptionally well, with 7 rigs running. As anticipated, related to our Sinochem announcement, we anticipate increasing that rig count to 10 rigs next year and then about 13 rigs in 2015. As shown there, that will ramp up our drilling of wells to 86 this year, up to 120 next year and about 165 in the subsequent year. That's all -- that's a part of the agreed-to work plan and budget for Sinochem.","The 2013 campaign will continue to test multiple intervals, A intervals in the Wolfcamp, Upper and Lower B, as well as D. We're still looking at about $7.5 million to $8 million cost of these wells for an average 7,800-foot lateral. Of course, that will include some 10,000-foot wells, one of which we've already drilled and we have another soon to be put on production. As Scott mentioned, it's $1.5 million to $1.6 million. But we're also looking at substantial increases in productivity, probably 40% increases in productivity. So we continue to see essentially a linear relationship between productivity and lateral length.","We are going to continue to optimize our completions. That's, of course, a requirement in these shale plays to look for continuous improvement. One thing we are trying is what some offset operators have tried -- or, used for some time and that is slickwater fracs. We have 1 well on flowback that we've used slickwater and 1 that is yet to be completed. But suffice it to say, there's substantial savings for slickwater fracs as compared to shale-conveyed fracs that can range from $800,000 to $1 million per well, which means you could have substantial benefits across the entire program. We do continue of course in this area as we're drilling some new areas to have at least some science costs continuing, probably about $20 million this year. And of course, that's for microseismic cores, log sleets and so on.","As you look forward to 2014 and beyond, we'll be more focused in the southern area on development drilling. So you can expect a lot more pad drilling, so going to about 75% pad drilling versus about 50% this year. And as Scott has already alluded to, the work will be done to evaluate how far we can downspace this field, in which case we're just adding significant opportunities. So the objective is take the spacing perhaps as low as 70 acres.","Let's go to Slide 12 then, and let's turn to the northern acreage. Of course, it's a major objective of our 2013 drilling campaign to prove up the prospectivity of the Wolfcamp and the Jo Mill and the Spraberry shales in this vast area. Currently, we only have 1 rig running. Of course, the plan is to increase that to 4 rigs early in 2013's second quarter. And we have drilled our first 2 horizontal Wolfcamp shales in Midland County, and these are the ones Scott referred to as being about 25 miles north of the successful Giddings horizontal wells. This well has been -- this HUD well has been absolutely phenomenal. It's a B zone well. It's made 40,000 barrels in its first month of production.","Similarly, as you look at the crude [ph] wells, when it comes to Giddings, they're phenomenal as well. After about 16 months, they produced 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent. So these wells are really outstanding, and we continue to see the prospects, as we go to the north, we can have some outstanding well results.  The second of the DL Hutt wells is an A well and where -- it's in the frac bank waiting to be frac-ed.","We now are, as Scott mentioned, drilling a couple wells in Martin County. Those are Wolfcamp B wells, and we'll have more to report as those wells are put on production in the next few months.","All of this, of course, is based on our substantial amount of data. We have drilled 7,000 wells out here, and we've done substantial petrophysical analysis on some 900 wells that tied to thousands of feet of core. So we have a very good handle on the prospectivity of all of these zones throughout the acreage.","And the objective, of course, in the north is to accelerate our understanding regarding the various zones, and I'll talk more about that on the next slide, Slide 13. As shown here, we'll be targeting in our 2013 drilling plan about 30 to 40 wells in the north. About half of those, 15 to 20 wells, will target the various Wolfcamp zones, A, B and D. In addition to which, we'll drill a similar number of wells, something like 15 to 20 wells, to test the Jo Mill, which has already been the subject of 2 wells, as well as the -- a middle Spraberry Shale and a lower Spraberry Shale. The Jo Mill wells have actually produced phenomenally well, as Scott has mentioned as well. Actually, they've averaged about 37,000 BOE, having only been on production for about 4 months, which is substantially more than a typical Jo Mill well will contribute to a normal vertical producing well.","So as we look ahead, again, we're looking at probably $7.5 million to $8 million drill cost for 7,000-plus foot laterals. Recall, as we go -- we are deeper drilling as we go north.","It's important to note in the campaign for 2013 that we have substantial new infrastructure needed to deal with the substantial production volumes and liquids volumes that are coming from the new wells. I mean, it's really an order of magnitude increase in the amount of liquids we're handling. So we need substantial investment in new tank batteries, flow lines, salt water disposal and so on. We estimate that's about $80 million for 2013 and perhaps a similar amount for 2014 as we ramp up the program in the north.","And as shown on Slide 14, it's really, in our case, about connecting the dots. You can see here kind of a broad map of where we plan to appraise the various areas of our acreage, including in Martin County and Midland County, Giddings County and so on in the north. The objective is to drill wells totaling capital of about $400 million and about $600 million in 2014 in all of these areas.  And what we're, of course, chasing is these 6 intervals, including the 3 Wolfcamp intervals, 1 Jo Mill and 2 Spraberry shales that I showed on the earlier slide.","And if you consider that across these stacked laterals, you have about 600,000 acres of planned view, that means we're really dealing with something that's 3 million gross acres when you consider it in 3D perspective, due to the stacked intervals. And we believe from the information we've already divined from all the science work I mentioned, that we have about 3 billion BOE of resource potential in the north. It will take about $1 billion to demonstrate that in the next couple of years, and that actually excludes the Spraberry Shale zones.","It looks like we'll exit 2013 with about 5,000 to 7,000 BOE net of horizontal production. Of course, our production is backloaded in 2013 simply because we're just in the process of ramping the rigs up, and it is the case that the horizontal wells take a longer time between when they're spud and when they're put on production. Our average is running 120 days where vertical wells were more like 70 days, so that has the effect of skewing production through the back end of the year. We do, however believe and continue to believe that horizontal drilling is more capital efficient than vertical drilling, and so that's why we're heading with more capital towards the horizontal campaign.","And where we're going to be 4 rigs this year, we plan to be about 6 to 8 rigs next year to drill the wells I mentioned and to spend the $600 million to appraise the program. In addition, although we haven't gotten specific details on this, we will eventually be testing deeper horizontal zones. We think it's already been proven, there's substantial opportunity in the Atoka for horizontal drilling. That's been proven in Martin County by other operators. But we'll also look to perhaps test zones that are deeper than the Wolfcamp in addition to the Atoka, such as the Woodford and the Barnett and the Mississippian.","So suffice it to say, what we're trying to do here is to spend roughly $1 billion in the north over the next couple of years, the objective being to confirm about 3 billion barrels of resource potential and in doing so, add substantial value. We're very confident that, that's going to occur over the next couple of years.","Turning to the vertical program. Lest we forget, the vertical program is that which contributed to our excellent production growth in 2012, and we will be continuing our vertical program albeit at a smaller rig count. We'll be drilling with only about 15 rigs this year, 2013, drilling about 300 wells. Scott already mentioned the fact that the reason we were landing on 15 rigs is that we have continuous drilling obligations on many of our leases. And by drilling wells vertically, we've not only preserved the leasehold, but we've also preserved the deep rights that will be the subject of future horizontal drilling in the Wolfcamp and other zones.","We are, as a result of the success we've had in the past, deepening the vast majority of our wells. In fact, as you look at 2013 this year, we plan to deepen about 90% of the wells into the Strawn, Atoka or the Mississippian, as the case may be. This was already mentioned, but we have -- we're expecting, at least, to draw down our frac bank. We did build somewhat of a frac bank at the end of 2012. I'll comment more about that in just a minute. Suffice it to say, though, we think drilling deeper is really the key to the economics and the productivity of our vertical campaign.","Turning to Slide 16. This is kind of summing up the impact of all the activity I've mentioned in both 2012 and 2013, where we expect over many years that the production will grow substantially in Permian Basin. We did come in at the top end of our range in the Permian Basin for the year, about 66,000 BOE.","The fourth quarter was relatively flat compared to the third, and that's because, on the one hand, we were reducing our vertical rig count as we were shifting to a higher component of horizontal drilling in the mix. And as I already mentioned, we did increase our frac bank in relation to vertical wells mostly because we were shifting to more capital-intensive horizontal drilling. We do anticipate that as we go forward, we'll be growing these assets substantially 14% to 21%.","We think most of the issues that we dealt with in the fourth quarter related to ethane recoveries at our gas plants in the Permian Basin will be resolved beginning April, as we bring on another 200 million cubic feet a day facility to increase our capacity there to 460 million cubic feet a day. So we think this issue pertaining to reduced ethane recoveries will be resolved shortly.","We do expect that horizontal production will increase, needless to say, as we ramp up in both the north and the south. It averaged about 2,000 barrels a day in 2012 and anticipate it's going to be 11,000 to 14,000 barrels a day this year. And that's, of course, reflecting the joint interest transaction with Sinochem being effective on June 1.","So in summary, the Spraberry trend area and the Permian Basin in general, both horizontal and vertical, should really provide outstanding opportunities for growth and value adds many years into the future.","Let me turn on Slide 17, the Eagle Ford. Our drilling campaign continues there, and we're consistently setting new records for production. We drilled about 30 wells in the fourth quarter, put about 37 on production, expect to drill a similar number of wells this year as we drilled last year. But because of efficiencies, both in terms of the number of days on wells, also translated to the amount of feet per day that we're able to drill increasing and the fact we're going to about 80% pad drilling, not only will we save money related to those activities, but also we'll be able to drill the same number of wells as we did in 2012 with 12 rigs, with only 10 rigs in 2013.","We will continue to push the limits in terms of the use of white sand as a proppant, replacing ceramic sand and anticipate the program will be over 50% white sand this year. And of course, there's a dramatic cost savings related to frac-ing these wells with white sand as compared to more expensive ceramic.","We are increasing the lateral lengths. We're doing an exhaustive study of improvements and completions. One thing we'll be doing related to that is increasing the lateral lengths from about 5,700 feet on average last year to about 6,200 feet this year. Of course, that does increase cost per well probably in the neighborhood of $500,000, but the data shows it's well worth it. The returns on the extra 500 feet are very strong.","Still looking at $7 million to $8 million well cost, especially as we increase the lateral lengths, netting out the cost savings from pad drilling.","We're substantially complete building our central gas processing facilities, or CGPs. We'll add 1 more by the end of 2013 and perhaps 1 in 2014. But essentially, our infrastructure build-out is nearing completion in the Eagle Ford.","This asset really continues to deliver, and you can see that on Slide 18. We continue, as I said, to set production records. This asset, similar to the Permian Basin, also produced at the top end of our guidance range for the year at about 28,000 BOE, strong fourth quarter production. And we anticipate strong growth going forward, as you can see, expect 36% to 50% growth into 2013 compared to 2012.","On Slide 19. As was contemporaneously announced at the time of the Sinochem joint interest declaration, we have decided to discontinue the efforts to divest the Barnett Shale assets. The bottom line is the bids were really, in our opinion, not reflective of the value of the assets. In fact, the values we received in some situations were less than what we consider to be the PDP value, and we got very really little value for what we think is very valuable acreage and drilling inventory. So we have decided to retain these assets and have returned those to continuing operations, and we'll maintain a drilling program to retain the acreage. We did put several wells on production in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate that going forward as we move from a 1-rig count, where we currently are, to a 2-rig count next quarter; the objective being to hold high-graded acreage. The returns here are still very good. They're plus or minus 25% pretax returns. So this drilling does make sense for us. And the objective is to retain our best acreage, that it to say, the acreage with the most liquid-rich opportunities. And that would be something like 45,000 acres out of about 65,000 acres that are currently not held by production.","We are seeing dramatic increases in the efficiencies. In fact, we have about a $3 million target for drilling costs for these wells. We've seen several wells drilled substantially below $3 million. In fact, some of these wells have been drilled in 7 and 8 days. So we really believe that this Barnett Shale asset, as we drill it out, is really going to add value. And as you can see, it is increasing production as a result of these activities.","Finally, I'll talk about Alaska. Of course, production was relatively flat in the quarter. But really more importantly in Alaska is our activities that we have underway, the first of which relates to the frac-ed program. If you recall, last year, we had a really phenomenal well as we put in place a -- your typical Lower 48 style frac on a Nuiqsut well. It made 5,600 barrels a day. That well is still making 2,000 barrels a day on a flat line, and so it's been a tremendously strong well. And accordingly, we're planning to frac 4 more wells, one of which is in the Torok formation and 3 in the Nuiqsut. We're currently mobilizing the equipment out on the ice, and the first fraction commence in the next couple of weeks. And we anticipate finishing that program for -- off ice probably mid-April.","Importantly, we now have put the Nuna 1 well, which is our first Torok well drilled last year, back on production. Last year, it made about 2,000 barrels with facility constraints. We're still somewhat facility-limited with that well. It was testing right on 2,800 barrels a day, so it looks very, very strong. At the same time, we're drilling an offset well as the Nuna 2 well to this first well, and it will also be frac-ed. We should have more information on it. And pending the results of these wells, we're moving ahead looking at a FEED study to evaluate a future development in the Torok in the south from onshore.","So I'm going to stop there. Suffice it to say, 2013 is shaping up to be a very strong operational year for us.","And with that, I'll pass it over to Rich for a discussion of the fourth quarter financials and his outlook for the first quarter.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 21. As Scott mentioned, net income attributable to common stockholders was $29 million or $0.22 per share. It did include unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains of $14 million after tax or $0.11, and then unusual items totaling $92 million or $0.72 primarily related to a noncash impairment charge related to our Barnett Shale assets that we moved back into continuing operations. So adjusted for those items, we were at $107 million, or $0.83, per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of Slide 21. We show fourth quarter guidance in the first column there. In the middle column, we adjust for the unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains, unusual items and Barnett Shale to be in an apples-to-apples comparison. You can see there that, basically, we're within on the positive side guidance with the exception of G&A, which includes performance-related compensation that we reported in the fourth quarter. All the other items were in middle of the guidance or on the good side.","Turning to Slide 22, price realizations. Now looking at the green bars, you can see that oil was down 5% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, just under $84. NGLs continue to be fairly flat, running still 35% to 40% of WTI oil prices. And gas, you can see there, we were up 22%, up to $3.20 for the fourth quarter.","At the bottom, you can see the impact of VPPs during the fourth quarter. That is the end of our VPPs, so we don't have those anymore going forward. And then for each of the fourth quarter, you can see that we had positive impact from our derivative portfolio, adding to our overall prices when you include derivatives.","Turning to Slide 23. Production costs were down 6% to $14.62 for the quarter. As we talked about in the third quarter, the third quarter was high because of extra hauling costs of salt water disposal, electricity costs and repair and maintenance. Those have all reversed and are down in the fourth quarter. We did add disposal wells that we talked about during the fourth quarter. We've got more planned for '13, which will help bring overall production cost down further.","Turning to Slide 24. First quarter production guidance of 165,000 to 170,000 barrel oil equivalents per day, and it does reflect, as Tim and Scott mentioned, that the processing facility is still impacting us 2,000 to 3,000 barrels a day for the first quarter, but then should be back up and running with the new plant capacity in April. Production costs at $14 to $16 per barrel and then the remaining of the items here are all consistent with the fourth quarter. So I won't go through those individually, but they're there for your review.","So Vickie, I think at this time, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take the first question today from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of questions, please. Scott, you talked about the -- or you gave us some great color, I think, on the Tier 1 and Tier 2 acreage. Can you help us with -- is there any difference between the 2 in terms of what is prospective for all 4 Wolfcamp zones? And it's probably a little too early, but is there any specific differences you could share between your expected EURs from the wells? And I'm guessing it's a little early for that. But I've got a follow-up, please.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, obviously, the Wolfcamp B is the focus. We haven't put a type curve on the 1,700 barrel a day well, the HUD well. But it looks like it's tracking twice as much as the Giddings reserves, so it could easily get to 1 million barrels or higher. We would expect, since we're in the center part of the basin on most of our acreage, that the Wolfcamp B is going to be the driver. The Wolfcamp A throughout the entire interval is -- actually has more oil in place. It is a little bit lower pressure than the Wolfcamp B as we frac into the Wolfcamp A and go up into the Dean formation. So it's got a huge potential. But right now, we just don't know the upside in regard to the A. We have -- the offset well to the HUD well is a Wolfcamp A. We expect to frac it in the next few weeks, so we should have information over the next 2 or 3 months on that well. The Cline, if you remember, we drilled a Wolfcamp D, a Cline well, back -- it was really our first well in the Wolfcamp play. We drilled in the center of Midland County. It turns out that well has flattened out, very, very short lateral. When you normalize it, it looks like the Cline or the Wolfcamp D is going to be up somewhere at 500,000 barrels or 575,000 or higher. So we are excited about the Cline also, and the D -- or the D. That's where a lot of people on the eastern side of the play are drilling. The Wolfcamp A and B gets thinner. It's not as rich organically on the eastern side of the play, and that's why they're focused on the Cline. We're focused more on the B because it has tremendous oil in place, good reservoir pressure. We'll eventually move to the A and then eventually move to the Cline in the northern appraisal program.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up is really, I guess, more strategic about how you think about what is clearly -- it looks like it's going to be an enormous resource space. When you -- within the southern joint venture, I think one of the considerations was the need to hold acreage. I'm guessing you don't have that problem in the core of your Spraberry area. So I'm just thinking about how do think about this thing longer term? Is this something that would ultimately make a joint venture? Would that make sense? Or given the step-up in rig count that you're planning, is this something you intend to do organically? And I'll leave it there.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, if you recall, what drove us to the south -- in fact, Chris and Tom, Tom Spalding and Chris Cheatwood, always told me that we should be drilling to the north because it's the best acreage. The only reason we went south was because we did have 50,000 acres that was expiring. We actually have renewed that and got a 3-year extension, but we do have a continuous development clause on that also to the south. Also, Tim and I had both mentioned, we do have the 15 vertical rigs to the north that are protecting leasehold on continuous development clauses. We're really protecting our grid economics on vertical, but we're really protecting them also for future horizontal Wolfcamp and shales over time. Right now, obviously, we're doing the recent deal to the south. We feel like that we don't need to do a JV at this point in time. That's always an option down the road. For the north, obviously the north is going to be worth a lot more than 21,000 per acre based on our results so far. But we have no contemplations at this point in time. It's an option we have way down the road and would consider at some point in time.","Operator","And we'll now go to Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your commentary and plans around the Spraberry shales. I guess, first, just kind of putting those perhaps in the context of potential implications for the resource space and then also timing of those first tests, how we ought to think about that.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. On the resource slide, we did not include the lower or the middle Spraberry shales as outlined on the log that Tim went over. We only include a risked Jo Mill in the resource potential. So at this point in time, with no production history, we do have core analysis and log data that shows there's huge amount of oil in place in both of those intervals. We do expect a little bit lower reservoir pressure. So that really, the critical thing is getting good rates of those. So that's why they are not in our -- really, our production forecast, or our reserve potential in that regard. On Jo Mill, we did use about a 500,000 barrel type curve, but we heavily \t risked it in that regard into our resource potential. Tim, you want to comment on the drilling plans in the next few years in the Spraberry shales?","Timothy L. Dove","See, I think, as I said, we're going to -- you're looking at a combination of wells in the Spraberry shales and the Jo Mill over the next couple of years. That schedule is actually still being worked out, and the definition of it is not what we can disclose, the exact number of wells, in what zone, for what timing. But suffice it to say, about 15% to 20% of our well -- or, 15 to 20 wells will be drilled in those 3 zones. I wouldn't be surprised if we tried to do kind of a mixture of all 3 in this year and then further increasing that in 2014.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. And just to clarify, with success in the horizontal development of the Spraberry shales, would that ease into the vertical Spraberry resource? Or would you view that as additive?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the -- we will -- what's happened, you saw where we had to move off 80 million barrels on our press release on the reserves from reaching the 5 years of issue with the SEC. We still have some more of those over time as we move to more horizontal drilling. Eventually at some point in time, we have tremendous success in all 3 Spraberry zones, it will point to less and less vertical drilling. But the vertical drilling is important again to hold leases by production. And so over time, you will see a lot more horizontal Wolfcamp being booked and also Spraberry Shale intervals, horizontal being booked and less vertical. So I don't think we'll ever give up on the vertical because we need to hold leases. We're also adding other zones to the vertical, such as the Strawn, the Atoka and the Mississippian, to make it even more economical. So it will probably happen slowly. Michael, we did move from 40 to 15 vertical rigs, but we really envision that 15 vertical rig program over the next 3 years.","Operator","Next is Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Two questions for you, and one is actually -- probably the first one is a good follow-up to that. At one point, you guys were talking about a development pattern for a 960-acre unit that, I believe, has 14 horizontals in the Wolfcamp and then an incremental, I think, 40 or 42 vertical wells. Should we just kind of assume that, that model is not applicable going forward? Or is that still something that you guys are contemplating?","Timothy L. Dove","Charles, it's Tim. I think what's happened, of course, is as we've gotten more information from drilling in particular different zones, we're really looking at a situation you could have multi-stacked laterals and downspace from even 140-acre spacing, perhaps as low as, let's say, 70-acre spacing. But you can have literally up to 6-stacked laterals in some of these areas. So that's going to take a substantial amount of capital. It's possible that you could be pushing out vertical drilling sometime into the future rather than necessarily focusing on a combination of horizontal and drilling -- horizontal and vertical drilling over that 960. So I think -- with that still under evaluation, I think right now, we're getting pretty excited about all these additional horizontal zones.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then following up on that, one of the horizontal zones that seems to be conspicuous in its absence of mention is the Wolfcamp C. Is that more -- is that permanently off the map for you guys? Or is that just your sense that, that's at the back of the line and you're holding depths with the Wolfcamp D? I mean, where does it fall on that spectrum?","Timothy L. Dove","I think where it is, it's certainly not something we're ready to condemn. In fact, some of our acreage looks prospective for the Wolfcamp C. However, it's not all of the acreage. It comes and goes as to prospectivity. And so it's just down the seriatim of opportunities to the point where it's -- we're not going to get to it before we get the rest of this stuff done.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","It's just at the back of line. Okay, great.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes.","Operator","We'll now go to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the timing it takes to bring wells online, the horizontal wells and Wolfcamp online. I think you mentioned it's more like 120 days. Can you just run through the key bottlenecks there and how you see that playing out in terms of your ability to reduce that over the course of the year?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, the first thing to be said is the drilling of the wells, we're actually working hard to reduce the number of days drilling. But in general, the early drilling of the horizontal wells is roughly around 30 to 40 days. Some of the wells -- in fact, the last 10,000-foot lateral we were mentioning in earlier comments, we drilled in as few as 18 to 19 days. So that's one area we're going to be looking at reducing basically time on the wells in terms of drilling. The second thing is to the extent we have a frac bank, there a lot of days in between when the wells are drilled and then prepared for frac-ing. The fracs themselves take only about 8 to 10 days in terms of total time, in terms of the number of stages pumped. Then we have time when we're waiting on basically connecting the wells, and then infrastructure in a lot of these areas is being built out to the area. So in a lot of these areas, we're in a situation in which we're drilling the first large volume wells. A lot of cases, we're drilling pad and we're doing pad drilling. So to the extent we're doing pad drilling, we're drilling, say, 3 wells on a pad, each of those takes 30 days. You're in a situation where you start -- you're not going to be producing the other wells on the pad until they're all drilled. So when you start looking at it on average, the averages of all those components, our average is 120 days. And it will be our objective to move that down as we move forward. Pad drilling kind of works against that, as I mentioned. But nonetheless, it will be our objective to continually monitor this and try to improve it through time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And separately, on the use of longer laterals, you may have said this, but could you just refresh us on the increase in well costs to get to the 7,800 and then again to the 10,000? I think it's kind of have to amount to 2 million. But then, more importantly, what would you expect out of the EUR? We certainly see some strong initial rates, but what's your expectation? Are you planning for an increase in -- or a decrease in funding and development costs? Or are you just planning for proportional increase in EUR?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think, if you look at empirical data on this -- of course, it's relatively limited. And the fact, we've only got one 10,000-foot well currently producing even though we've drilled a couple more and waiting on production. But the data shows that the -- going from about 7,000 to 7,500 feet in terms of lateral length to 10,000 is about $1.5 million incremental cost. And for that, at least as to this data point we're looking at now, you could be looking at about a 40% increase in productivity. And so your well cost is going up probably 20%, but your productivity is going up 40%. So therein lies a lot of capital efficiency. And I think what you're going to see is, kind of as you alluded to, I mean when you're adding essentially more volume at less cost, you're going to reduce your F&D cost on each well and, therefore, in the entire program.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess implicit in that, is your expectation that the decline rate will stay the same for the longer lateral well? Or would we see a different decline curve?","Timothy L. Dove","Actually, if you take look at our data, it looks very similar. This is true of the HUD area. It's true of the Giddings area. It's true of the 10,000-foot lateral. They tend to look very close in terms of the actual shape of the decline curves. What we're really alluding to is that fact that these longer laterals start at a higher level and stay at a higher level but still decline at a similar rate.","Operator","Next is Brian Corales with Howard Weil.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up question there. So basically, the 575,000 barrel or 650,000 barrel type curve, that's based more on a 5,000-foot lateral?","Timothy L. Dove","No, that's based on a 7,000-foot lateral.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","7,000-foot lateral. Okay, okay. And Tim, you mentioned testing...","Timothy L. Dove","Let me clarify real quick. Because when we're talking about the Giddings wells, we're comparing those to a 650,000 BOE unadjusted for length, and the lateral length of those were 5,300 feet. When we talk about the southern Wolfcamp area, we use 575,000 BOE as the average EUR for a 7,000-foot lateral equivalent. So we have a little bit of apples and oranges you have to understand there.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","No, no, no. Understood. Okay. And then Tim, you talked about tighter spacing. Are you all currently testing downspacing from 140s? Or is that kind of way down the road?","Timothy L. Dove","I think we'll be doing some of it in 2013. In this year's drilling, we'll be testing that idea out of the limited handful of wells. But we need to start that process, understand for longer-term planning what the eventual spacing situation is. And that starts this year.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And is it -- do you think that varies by Wolfcamp zone?","Timothy L. Dove","Probably not Wolfcamp zones. I think the question is, when you get into the zones where we have much more drilling, such as the Spraberry shales and the Jo Mill, you may be more limited on downspacing. But I don't think that's going to be the case in the Wolfcamp.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then one final, if I could. You're averaging longer laterals now in the Eagle Ford. Should we just assume that we will see an increase to EUR over -- whether it's this year or next year over time?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think we still see a similar relationship that is basically linear relationship as we do in the Permian Basin between lateral length and productivity. That said, the actual incremental cost is not linear. It's not that much more expensive, as we've shown, to drill out of, let's say, 1,000 feet more than to not. And so this is where your capital efficiency increases.","Operator","We'll now go to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping maybe you could take us through what you're seeing on oil cuts for some of your longer producing wells horizontally in the Permian. Obviously, a lot of these wells would then [ph] come on somewhere around 75% to 80% oil. Can you just talk about how maybe that cut degrades a little bit over time and what your expectations are for kind of a longer-term tail oil cut in a lot of those wells?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we can already see this, Brian (sic) [Leo]. It's kind of as expected. Your GOR, generally when these wells are brought on productions, it's about 1,000. And if the case -- and this is true of all vertical wells in addition to horizontal wells, we see that the -- the GOR goes up through time. And actually, it goes up to 2,000 and 2,500 feet -- 2,500 eventually. We already see this in some of the horizontal wells. They tend to come on about 80% to 90% oil. And then they gradually through time, even though we're in the first year or so, get down to 75% oil. It's just a factor of drawing down the pressure in the reservoir.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just a question on your 3-year guidance where you're talking about 13% to 18% production growth. Obviously, there's a lot of factors going into this, but is -- when you guys say that the biggest factor is the oil price range, when you guys talk about $85 to $100 WTI moving around in that guidance?","Scott D. Sheffield","Your 2 big factors is $85 flat to $100 flat on WTI. And the second factor is in the northern program, the Wolfcamp and the Spraberry shales, we only use roughly a 500,000 barrel type curve.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess last question here on Alaska. Obviously, you guys have a pretty nice drilling program. To the extent that that's successful, do we expect production to start ramping up in the second quarter potentially in '13? Or will we have to wait for additional infrastructure at some point later on?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, first of all, the southern Nuna wells, we'll not be able to count towards production because we don't have a sanctioned project, so that's not going to be on the table. However, to the extent that our projects that are related to the frac-ing from the island work as they did last year, you should see a pretty significant increase in production, and it would start basically in the second quarter. There are no facility limitations in terms of putting those wells on production from the island, so we would just turn them on to sales. We're hopeful that we can get the kind of results that we did last year when we put that N1 Nuiqsut well on at 5,600 barrels a day. So we could have a pretty material bump in production if all goes well.","Operator","And we have time for one more question, and we'll take that question from Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I did want to ask you a little bit about -- obviously some good well results; a very good well result up north and a successful extended lateral on the south. And just comment to the extent that you believe you de-risked the horizontal Wolf count terms of acreage or locations? I guess, we have been thinking about maybe 200,000-acre potential up north. But looking from the slide, you're looking at maybe a broader swath closer to 600,000 acres. Just wanted to get your comments on de-risking the play thus far.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Arun, as we have stated, we have thousands of wells that we drilled, hundreds of wells we've taken core data and extensive open note logging data from both us and other operators. We're the largest holder of that data in the Midland Basin. And so for the last 18 months, the geologist team had wanted to drill a lot more wells up north because we know it's probably the best area. And what drove us down south was essentially the expiring acreage on the University. So I think the Diamondback well confirms -- because it came in at half the lateral length as the HUD, it came in about half the rate. So to me, that's an important well. That's about 10, 12 miles away further out west. That confirms the maps. So the Martin County well to the north will be the next set of wells. So we're very confident that it will continue to play out like we have shown.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the Martin County, I just wanted to get your quick take. I think W&T Offshore had a pretty good well result on the shorter lateral. Presumably, this increases your confidence just around your 2 Martin County tests.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I have not -- I've asked my geo team about that. I have not got confirmation on what zone they penetrated, so I do not know. But I saw that they potential-ed the well with the Texas Railroad Commission.","Thank you. And again, that's the last. We're going to have to get off. We appreciate it. And we'll be traveling around over to several of the conferences over the next 3 weeks, and we're looking forward to meeting with everybody. Again, thank you very much.","Operator","And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"17220":["Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  5, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank E.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins","Thank you, Shannon. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Shannon mentioned, you can find the slides for this call at www.pxd.com. I want you to note that the version of these slides that's on the website now has been updated from the version that we posted last night. It now includes 2 slides related to our equity offering, which will be discussed during this call. This updated version is the one that will be used on today's call and the page numbers will be aligned to that version. With that housekeeping matter out of the way, let me briefly go over the agenda for the call today. Scott's going to be up first. He's going to discuss the rationale behind the transactions that were announced last evening to enhance Pioneer's balance sheet. He'll also provide operating highlights for the third quarter. Again, another great quarter for Pioneer and one which highlights that we are successfully executing the growth program we committed to at the beginning of this year. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our continued strong horizontal drilling results in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and the Eagle Ford Shale. He will also provide color on some of the front-end loaded infrastructure projects that are being progressed to support Pioneer's long-term growth plan for the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. Rich will then cover the third quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.","With that -- or after that, we'll open the call up for your questions. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Thanks, Frank. Good morning. On Slide #3, on our rationale, capital funding. The combination with selling $1 billion of equity combining with announcing the expected sale of our Eagle Ford Midstream business, it allows Pioneer to really prudently develop its assets in what I believe could easily be a $70 to $80 oil price environment over the next 2 years.","As you all know, the price of oil has dropped about $30 a barrel. It is $1 trillion stimulus per year to the world economy. It's going to take a while to get the demand side up in the world today. At the same time, we're in a battle with Saudi Arabia in regard to market share versus U.S. shale oil.","This allows us, both transactions, to be able to have continued success, as Frank mentioned, of annual production growth of 16% to 21% through '16 at very attractive returns of 40% to 80% before tax. As footnoted, those returns could significantly improve if you see a significant drop in the rig count, which I expect in first quarter among other industry participants and various plays throughout the U.S., in addition to other initiatives that we are initiating out in the field and optimization program.","We won't decide on our final rig count until we announce it in early February on our schedule, whether it's 0 rigs, whether it's 5 rigs or whether it's 10 rigs add during the year. We have tremendous flexibility with our rig contracts as most of them are on a 3-year contract, but we purposely had them expiring 1\/3 in '15, 1\/3 in '16 and 1\/3 in '17. It all depends on what oil prices are over the next 3 months.","Again, the use of proceeds, in addition to the growth and continued success, is to fund front-end loaded infrastructure, which will provide significant cost savings in the future. Total of about $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion over the 2-year period. The main cost will be $500 million to $700 million for our water distribution system and network coming out of the city of Odessa and the city of Midland, which Tim will give more detail on, which will save us about $0.5 million -- over $0.5 million per well. When you look at over 20,000 drilling locations, it's over $10 billion of savings over the next several years.","In addition, we're continuing to build out large horizontal tank batteries. And eventually, as we get into development drilling, we won't have to spend the money on those tank batteries and save over $0.5 million per well.","In addition, we'll be -- several new gas processing facilities will be coming on. We'll be expanding our sand mine to almost 3x for $125 million. And we're doing all of this over the next 2 years to make sure we maintain a debt-to-book below 35% and debt-to-cash-flow below 1.5. So both of these allows us to prudently develop our industry-leading position in probably the largest oil field in the U.S., in the world-class Spraberry\/Wolfcamp oil field.","Slide #4, a little background on the Eagle Ford midstream divestiture. Pioneer owns 50.1%, we're doing it jointly with Reliance, who owns 49.9%. Pioneer's the operator. Data room will open in December. Bids are expected shortly thereafter. We expect to announce a successful sale sometime between mid- and late-first quarter. Sale proceeds back into the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp assets.","The rest of the detail, in regard to description, I won't go over that detail. Probably the most important item is our forecasted cash flow to Pioneer is a little over $100 million for 2015. And obviously, with the MLP still trading at a very, very rich premium, we expect some significant offers for this asset. Also, our ability to export processed condensate remains unaffected by this expected divestiture. In addition, we have no plans to divest our Eagle Ford Shale upstream assets.","Slide #5. Just to summarize what's happened in Pioneer over the last 3 years. We've successfully transformed our Spraberry\/Wolfcamp acreage from a vertical play into a world-class horizontal play on our 825,000 acres, appraising 6 of highly prospective stacked intervals with strong EURs, internal rate of returns with very high oil content.","We've grown our resource potential from 3.1 billion barrels over 3x to 9.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, adding significant net asset value. Over 20,000 horizontal drilling locations, more than double production from 45,000 barrels a day equivalent to over 100,000 barrels a day. Entered in our joint venture Sinochem. Developed a world-class premier pressure pumping company, in addition to acquiring the fourth-largest sand mine in the U.S., which is only about a 3-hour drive out to West Texas.","Increased our gas processing capacity with our ownership being 27% to 30% from roughly 285 million a day to 1 billion a day. Secured a long-term water supply to move away from freshwater over the next several years. And we negotiated third-party transactions to get premium pricing by moving away from the Mid-Cush differential and also getting -- over half of our production eventually will be priced off the Gulf Coast or LLS, minus transportation.","On Slide 6, just to show where we've gone from in '11 to '14, again, from 3 billion to 9.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the largest oil field in the U.S. today, so 3x.","Slide #7, as Frank said earlier, again, we're executing on our growth plan with great success. We are at the high end of production again, as we were second quarter. Again, in third quarter at 186,000 barrels a day, up 10,000. The oil production is 90% of that, up 9,000, 6% compared to second quarter and 12% on oil production growth compared to second quarter. Again, driven primarily by our success in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp play.","We're narrowing guidance to the upper end of our range to 18% to 19%. We've more than doubled the number of horizontal wells placed on production in second half compared to the first half. Already, production in mid-October is more than 195,000 barrels a day equivalent. Our guidance for the quarter will be 200,000 to 205,000 barrels a day.","A slight increase in our capital, roughly about $100 million drilling capital, primarily for optimization in regard to about 30 wells that we're optimizing with much bigger fracs, both sand and fluid. And then also in addition, some early expenditures on our water distribution system.","Again, forecasting production growth in this lower price environment is 16% to 21% over the next 2 years. We have great hedges in place also, probably the best hedges in place among the industry in 2015 and '16 on oil. And again, we're 100% protected on a the Mid-Cush differential, as I mentioned earlier.","Slide #18 (sic) [ Slide #8 ] Again, I think the most important point for the quarter is that we have delineated the Wolfcamp A interval. If you remember previously, we had 1 -- well on the 1 good A Well, and we put another 11 wells in the A throughout the entire northern program. All tremendous wells over 1,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day with an average lateral length of about 7,000 feet.","Eagle Ford continued to shine with both downspacing and the upper targets. Results continue to be very encouraging. Continued to export cargoes around the world, both to Europe and to Asia, our processed condensate with significant improved pricing. We'll continue to increase that amount of barrels exported going into 2015.","Also what's important, we've had multiple independent studies support lifting the oil export ban, in addition to the fact that gasoline prices would actually be lowered if we exported oil. The EIA came out last week, the very positive report in regard to saying that U.S. gasoline prices is governed by Brent oil and by world gasoline prices.","Continued to maintain, obviously, a strong financial flexibility, in addition to the equity offering and also the expected sale of Eagle Ford midstream. Cash on hand of $550 million and we did close Hugoton and Barnett during the quarter for $328 million and $150 million, all to redeploy to the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area.","Now Slide #9, again, on production growth, we had a great quarter, 186,000, 69% liquids. Guidance, 200 to 205 MBOEPD the fourth quarter and already in mid-October, we are over 195,000 barrels equivalent per day. As we see, we moved up to 75% liquids by 2016.","I'll now turn it over to Tim to go over more details of our assets.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. And now that we've completed a pretty substantial drilling program all the way from 2013 into the 9 months of 2014, we have compiled a very substantial set of data on the various zones in the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area. And in fact, we've put 56 wells on production in the Wolfcamp zone, as shown in the table, as well as several in the lower Spraberry Shale as well.","You can see on the map, we've had a widespread area of drilling. We have some areas we still have not yet done any drilling on but will be shortly as we needed to complete 3D seismic before beginning drilling in some of those areas.","The main important message here is that we continue to see consistent results on these wells. The production continues to support very strong EURs and returns. In fact, as Scott alluded to, even in the $70 to $80 oil environment, we're looking at returns in the neighborhood of 40% to 80%.","In terms of the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry Shale, you recall in the second quarter, we had some mixed completion issues. Glad to say, looking at the wells we've put on production in the third quarter, they're tracking very well and look a lot stronger reflecting the best wells we had reported on in the second quarter, with Jo Mill tracking about 800,000 BOE and the Middle Spraberry Shale about 700,000 BOE.","Data on our strongest individual wells can be actually seen in yesterday's press release. But as has been our practice in the last several quarters, you'll see on Slide 11, data on all the wells that have been drilled. And in fact, on Slide 11, we start with a review of all of the Wolfcamp B wells, large data set now, 33 wells in 4 counties. And you can see very consistent results here showing that the Wolfcamp B, we believe, can support EURs from 800,000 to 1 million barrels. And this data set continues to support the notion of very high returns in the Wolfcamp B.","Similarly, as we turn to Slide 12, on Wolfcamp A, Scott mentioned the fact we only had limited amount of data on Wolfcamp A prior to the third quarter, but we have put 11 more wells on production. And you can see the average of these wells, of all 11, in the red line, and I would consider this to be very strong results. It gives us a lot of confidence in the Wolfcamp A and leads us to the conclusion that the EURs are also in that 800,000 to perhaps, over 1 million BOE on average.","Turning now on Slide 13 to the Wolfcamp D. We've got a couple lines on this graph, and I need to explain what they mean. If you take a look at the darkest of the purple lines, this is the case in which we're showing all the Tier 1 wells that were drilled, of which there are a total of 11. The lighter purple line has to do with a couple of Martin County wells that we drilled that we consider to be in Tier 2 acreage. And as prognosed, they did underperform versus the Tier 1 wells. We needed to drill these in order to test our geologic model and to hold acreage. Obviously, this leads us to the conclusion that certain areas where we have Tier 2 acreage in the D, we will not be drilling in those areas going further.","But the main message is our Tier 1 drilling looks very good, and we would call the EUR, still in the range, but 650,000 to, in some cases, over 1 million BOE in different areas of those 4 counties.","Turning now to Slide 14. This is referencing the lower Spraberry Shale, 9 wells now in that data set. Relatively shorter laterals as is the case in some situations where we have leasehold configuration issues. But you also see a continuation of what has been mentioned in prior calls, which is a different trajectory of production growth than you see in the Wolfcamp as water is drawn off the system. But nonetheless, in the fullness of time, especially after about 90 days, once these wells have put on production, you show very strong results and consistent results, for that matter, again, with EURs ranging from 650,000 BOE to, again, over 1 million BOE. So very strong results in the Lower Spraberry Shale, as expected.","The next slide shows some of the new data regarding the recent Middle Spraberry Shale and Jo Mill wells that we drilled. Remember, I mentioned earlier, that in the second quarter, we had some completion issues, so we got some mixed drilling results, but much better results here. If you take a look at, for example, in the blue lines, particularly the dark blue line, this is the Middle Spraberry Shale, drilled in Upton County, relatively short lateral. It's in early days of production but is, in general, looking pretty good. Similarly, the lighter blue is the Middle Spraberry Shale drilled in Midland County, and it's exhibiting over 650,000-barrel type curve at this point.","The Jo Mill tends to be a bit of a different trajectory, showing a little bit more like Lower Spraberry Shale. And these wells are looking very good, both the red and the green lines over -- a little over 5,000-foot laterals and showing ranges that could be 650,000 up to 800,000 BOE.","I'd consider this still to be a relatively small data set, and so we're going to continue to appraise these wells. Of course, the amount of appraisal we do will be depending upon what our total rig count is. Pretty clearly, we're going to be focusing on the other zones that have been mentioned prior in terms of our focus for 2015.","Turning to Slide 16. Well, I guess, when you look at whether we've had success in execution or not, you should be looking at production. And I'm very pleased to say we've shown very strong production growth in the quarter. Of course, that's a result of the fact that we expected that due to the back-end loaded nature of the completions with the rig count building only during middle part of the year and going to predominately pad drilling. Though we did put on 73 wells in the combination of the northern and southern acreage during the quarter, production, 103,000 BOE a day, up substantially with the vast majority of that, as Scott mentioned earlier, being oil. And you can point then to a significant amount of growth in the fourth quarter for exactly the same reasons. So to me, this graph depicts the fact that we are really hitting on all cylinders from an execution standpoint.","Turning to Slide 17. I'm going to now change to a discussion surrounding our development campaign in the future. It was such a large campaign of development that we have coming over the next several years. We're taking a very holistic approach to the development, really, in the 10-year horizon. You could see on this particular slide, the various things we have to deal with when it comes to a 10-year program of drilling. In particular, I'm going to talk about 3 of these that are the subject of the capital raisings that Scott had mentioned, that being gas processing, fuel infrastructure and water.","And several of these resources will be dealt with when it comes to this capital being raised. But the capital's needed upfront over the next several years to prepare to bring this PV, of this total project forward, as drilling accelerates into the future.","So I'll touch on several of these in the next slide. Turning to Slide 18. Obviously, water is a very significant need when you look at the resources required to develop this asset. One of the main objectives of course, in our case, is to make sure we can bring in relatively attractive water when it comes to cost in terms of its acquisition and transportation. And a large water system will be required to do that.","Obviously, we want to get to a point where we're reducing our reliance and in fact, eliminating our reliance on fresh water at some point in the future. And also, reduce the need for disposal of produced water through increasing our recycling programs.","We're very pleased to note that we have good supply sources in terms of effluent water from both the city of Odessa, and we're finalizing agreement with the city of Midland to deliver upwards 360,000 barrels per day of water -- effluent water, over the next 3 years or so.","We've created an entity within Pioneer, with some great employees who are actively working this project. And we're really making great strides towards making our water availability something that would not be a concern, including drilling our own brackish water wells to buying brackish water from third sources and running several pilots for recycling. So we're really -- I think have a step ahead here when it comes to water.","But one important part of this is shown on Slide 19. That is a very large project that we're beginning to spend money on for the transportation of water, storage, utilization and recycling.","As shown on the cartoon that's depicted on the right, we're going to be building about 100-mile mainline, principally north-south and then going to the southeast, of very large diameter pipe. We'll also be laying fiber optics, cable -- fiber optic cables in the same ditch to, in essence, create what will be a state-of-the-art system in terms of communications and in terms of control with very limited people in the field. It'll be a world-class system, without a doubt.","We'll also need to build feeder lines regarding the new water supply from Odessa and Midland. And in addition to which, in the future, we'll be drilling -- be buildings subsystems that are out in the field areas to support drilling. And associated with that, frac ponds, some 120 to 150 frac ponds that are built strategically near where the drilling will be occurring.","Anticipate that the total project will be roughly $800 million to $1 billion spent over the next, say, 4 to 5 years. And it'll be built in phases, of course. The first phase of which is the subject of spending in 2015 and '16. It's basically the mainline system and the feeder lines to the bring in the new water sources in, and it's really the backbone of the system. We can control subsystems and frac ponds just based on where drilling occurs. And so it will depend upon where we land in terms of the capital budget. But nonetheless, overall, we're going to be spending probably a minimum of $250 million each over the next 2 years, 2015 and 2016, in this initial phase of the project.","Turning to Page 20. And we really believe, ultimately, the benefits of this are significant. It's obviously critical from the standpoint of the success of the executing on our plans. But it also will provide us relatively low-cost competitive water to develop the system. In addition to which, we believe the economics of this project are going to be very strong, probably in the neighborhood of 35% IRRs.","One important thing it does is get water out of trucks. It gets trucks off the roads, and you've been in Midland, you know what I'm talking about, it's a dangerous place. And we need to do everything we can to get trucks off roads out there. And we'll be heading more towards a recycling world that will allow us to utilize our produced water.","Ultimately, again, leading to a conclusion where we're not using any freshwater of any significance. Scott mentioned this, but this is significant. It's going to save us $500,000 per well. In a 20,000-well campaign that's very impressive.","Turning to Page 21. Two other critical front-loaded capital requirements are in the form of tank batteries and saltwater disposal, on the one hand, and gas processing on the other. We do have to build very large scale batteries and disposal wells and facilities in order to deal with the very high-volume wells in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp that require that kind of volume.","In 2014, for example, we spent about $250 million for these kind of facilities. We will have built over 30 tank batteries and over 25 saltwater disposal facilities this year. And expect that or more over the next couple of years, probably we'll be spending $300 million each in 2015 and '16 in similar expenditures. This will be going on for a few more years until we have all of this built out, ready for the significant acceleration of drilling wells and we'll have the tank batteries ready for all this volume.","It's easy to calculate, in gas processing, our need for perhaps up to a 200 million cubic feet a day new gas processing facility every 12 to 18 months. And you can see that occurring already this year. We have 2 new plants coming on, one is already on production, the Edward plant with Atlas. Another WTG plant coming on in about a month or so. And we have plans, in fact, have already made the orders to build another plant. In this case, Martin County with Atlas, that will come on December of 2015. Probably we'll need additional plans in 2016, the way it currently looks. So we're earmarking about $175 million of capital for the next 2 years in total to fund our share of these facilities.","And then finally -- turning to Slide 22, sand is just another critical component in the long-term plan. And we're really, really fortunate to have our Brady sand mine located very close to our field activities. It has about 750,000 tons a year current capacity, very significant reserves behind that of 68 million tons on a proved and probable basis. So we get multi-decade inventory of sand. And most of that, of course, is used on our own wells, and in fact, in the future, the vast majority will be used only by Pioneer wells.","With our growing needs though, it's very clear we need to go ahead and complete the expansion of this facility. We have a plan in 2015 to spend $125 million to expand capacity to 2.1 million tons. And that includes storage facilities and some preinvestment to the extent we want to add another expansion in 2 or 3 years.","We calculate this to have a very fast payout, because when you consider this mine with sand, the only alternative we would have would be to bring it in from the Midwest. That is to say, white sand, and the transportation costs and the issues pertaining to logistics of getting the sand down there are very significant. So we think this is a very fast payout project.","Turning to Slide 23, and now really turning away from Permian into Eagle Ford. Here, we continue to see the benefits in the Eagle Ford Shale of our downspacing and staggering program. In fact, we expect to put about 50 wells on production in the upper targets, as a part of that downspacing and staggering and adding upper Eagle Ford targets. About 35 wells of which have been placed on production so far this year and 18 in the third quarter.","I think we're pleased to say that the upper wells are showing very similar results at least when it comes to early production as compared to their offset lower wells. In fact, you can see in the graph to the right, there are cases, one shown here in Karnes County, a situation where the upper well actually exceeds the volume in the lower well and that of the parent well next door. So we're very pleased how this program is going. It'll be a large part of our program going forward in 2015 and beyond.","Turning now to Slide 24. Results were very good in the Eagle Ford, in fact, record production of about 47,000 BOE per day. You'll notice that was not up very substantially from the second quarter. However, it was an expected number, simply because we knew we'd have quite a large line of wells off production due to offset fracs that were being performed. We probably lost 1,000 barrels a day due to that. And also, we had anticipated a back-weighted POP schedule in the quarter, and that's exactly what happened. And you can see in our expectations for the fourth quarter that production continues a substantial ramp up to 50,000 to 52,000 BOE per day.","So we did put 35 wells on production. We're doing a great job of utilizing 2-string casing designs and that's saving us somewhere in the neighborhood of $750,000 to $1 million per well. Our optimization program, we've talked about through time, is really working well. We still see a 20% to 30% increase when it comes to pumping more sand, pumping higher volumes and fluids and changing the spacing in terms of the fracs.","The exportation of the Eagle Ford continues. We're exporting currently about 25% of our volume. Our process condensate, we're actually targeting that to be almost half of our production next year. We've participated in 6 cargoes during the July and November time frame. And we are seeing pretty substantial increases in pricing related to the export of the condensate, as compared to leaving it in what's a swamped U.S. market. And incidentally, we will continue to be able to export condensate in the event of a positive sale of our EFS midstream assets.","Turning to Slide 25, this is my final slide. It refers to the fact that we still need a lot of work to be done here to make sure that if we really are in a low-price environment, we are optimizing our returns. We are actively working with our service providers to seek cost reductions for 2015. All of those contracts are not let yet, so we have a lot of discussion going on to reduce costs as best we can for 2015 and after that.","We will, as you might expect, focus in 2015, in the event we are in a lower cost environment, on only the very best intervals. And as I've mentioned earlier, that's probably seen to be focused on the Wolfcamp B, A, and Lower Spraberry Shale. And probably deferred drilling in some of the other zones that are quite excellent in terms of how well they're performing, but we have less data and we might as well focus on the highest return wells first in this environment.","We're also -- we'll be continuing our optimization testing. You recall that we, similar to what we did in South Texas, in the Eagle Ford, we've moved that team into the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area to begin the process of optimization early in the campaign of drilling and that's being implemented. We'll continue doing that. Of course, some science cost we'd probably will try to limit if we're in a lower price environment in 2015.","I think it goes without saying that continuous improvement in shale plays is just part of the program. And as we continue to be working on that, it really amounts to, in our case, identifying and implementing D&C cost reductions. And it comes in a lot of different forms. I'm not going to go through everything we're doing, but the example would be the same 2-string design concept that were used in Eagle Ford, we're now looking at using and have successfully used in the Southern Wolfcamp area where we've drilled a well as fast as 12 days, which is unheard of in the past.","Of course, we're continuing our SIMOPS, simultaneous operations, when it comes to the completions of wells where we're actually putting wells on production at the same time we're drilling out other plugs and so on. And that's cutting several days, in some cases, about 8 days out of time to get the wells completed.","We also have done a lot of work to increase our subsurface understanding and that's helping us to optimize landing zones.","It doesn't just don't stop in terms of cost reduction on capital though. We're doing a lot of work on initiatives when it comes to reducing LOE. You can see our LOE costs have done phenomenally well. It has to do, first of all, with high volume wells. But we're also attentive to these costs and, for example, using plunger lifts as opposed to gas lift or ESPs or rod pumps, which are more expensive, where we can do so.","So you'll see us continue to pursue these initiatives. I mean, we would pursue them in a high-price environment and a low-price environment, so it's just something that we do as a part of the shale gain.","So I'm going to turn it over now, the call -- turn the call over to Rich for a discussion of our third quarter financials and fourth quarter guidance.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going start on Slide 26, where we report net income attributable to common stockholders of $374 million or $2.58 per diluted share for the quarter. It did include noncash mark-to-market derivative gains of $216 million or $1.49. That was primarily a result of our derivative -- value of our derivative portfolio going up, as the oil prices primarily declined and softened during the quarter.","It also included a loss associated with discontinued operations of $37 million or $0.26 per diluted share. This is primarily related to the sale of our Barnett and Hugoton assets as Scott referenced. So adjusting for those 2 items, we are at $195 million of earnings or $1.35 per share.","Looking at the bottom of this slide, where we look at results relative to guidance. You can see, as Frank mentioned, we had another great quarter being at the top end of production guidance. I won't go through all the line items here, but as Tim mentioned, production costs were at the -- below the guidance really is, and I'll mention it later, but as we bring on horizontal wells and our cost initiatives.","Turning to Slide 27, looking at price realizations. As you guys are aware, we did see softening of prices during the quarter. So you saw our oil prices were down about 5%, NGLs about 6% and gas prices down about 12%. That was offset some by our derivative position, which you see at the bottom of the slide, where we did have positive results from derivatives during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 28. As Tim mentioned, the production costs are down about 5% to $13.17 for the quarter per BOE, mainly as lower-cost horizontal wells are being placed on production, that is bringing it down. In addition, we did see with the softening of commodity prices that our production taxes were down for the quarter in addition to base LOE.","Turning to Slide 29, liquidity position. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.1 billion, that did include $550 million of cash on the balance sheet. So we're in excellent financial position at the end of the quarter, that will be further strengthened by the equity offering that we just completed. And once the Eagle Ford Midstream transaction is completed, that'll strengthen it as well. So excellent financial position for the next couple of years of infrastructure build up and capital plans that we have.","Turning to Slide 30, looking at fourth quarter guidance. We've talked about the production being up significantly in the fourth quarter, again, with our incremental addition of wells in the second half of the year, so 200,000 to 205,000 BOEs per day. The rest of the items here are generally consistent with what we've shown for past quarters, so I'm not go through each of those, but they're there for your review.","So with that, Shannon, I think we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions, if I may. The first one on the Midstream. Clearly, the decision to sell the Eagle Ford Midstream, it kind of begs the question with a such a large spend in the Permian, what are your longer-term plans for your midstream assets? Because clearly the MLP value is something to be considered I guess, and I'm just thinking about the scale of investment that you're going to have make. What is the prognosis for how you think about Midstream going forward? And I have a follow-up, please.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, Doug. I think, we have seen the benefit of owning -- we've owned this 27% to 30% for over 20 years. We've seen tremendously the benefit by owning a piece of -- all the processing plants in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp field. Allows us to execute, get tied-in quicker. And so it's a very, very important integrated piece of our integrated assets out in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. It's always a possibility way down the road but right now, it's been a tremendous benefit for us to own a piece of every plan and to educate all the various parties just like we do with Atlas. It took us a couple of years to educate them to get them to start building. We are excited about the target transaction. It leaves a much stronger, financially stronger MLP owning the assets, which should be able to build quicker and larger plants as we need them.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Fine. My follow-up is really about the high grading of the Pioneer capital. So per your prepared remarks, if Pioneer is going to start putting Pioneer dollars, if you like, into the better parts of the play, I mean, we saw what looks like a big step-up in oil mix this quarter for what you did deliver by way of production. So I'm just kind of trying to figure out, one, what does it mean for the ratable growth targets you've given us, given that you would be targeting higher EURs? And if I may, kind of double barrel the question, what does it mean for your thoughts on using third-party capital to maintain the potential value of the noncore assets that are, obviously, company makers for someone else if you chose to go that route?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, Doug. Obviously, we're going to wait and come out in early February with our capital budget. So we have lots of flexibility. It depends on what happens with the Iranian negotiations coming on that would carry November 24, the OPEC meeting on the 27th, what's going to be the price of crude going into our final decisions in late January, early February. We have extreme flexibility. It's still going to be within that 16% to 21% range, whether we keep rigs flat or whether we add 5 or add 10 rigs, so we have lots of flexibility. In regard to your second part of your question, referring to...","Timothy L. Dove","Bringing third-party capital in.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Oh, bringing third-party capital. At this point in time, in the sweet spot in the North, we just don't think, at this point in time, it's worth doing a third joint venture. It's always an option way down the road. It makes it -- we have found out, through time, it makes it tougher to divest of assets to get people attracted when you do have a joint venture partner. And so we do not see any -- that as an availability over the next couple of years in our northern acreage because it's great returns. As you can see, we've appraised. We have sold part of the acreage to the north. There are small pieces that we may look at over time on the fringes to divest.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","If I could pick up that point on the big infrastructure spend. Can you point us to anything, either in your history of development across different plays or maybe in other places in the industry where a company has led the infrastructure development of a play of this size, including not just the typical midstream things but really the guys -- things that you're focusing on like water and sand?","Timothy L. Dove","Charles, I think, first of all, I don't think there has ever been a shale development of the magnitude we're talking about, considering the shale plays are relatively new in the industry. I mean, you'd have to look at the kind of infrastructure build out and the requirements here as something akin to the North Slope development in the fullness of time. Now they have different -- we have different needs in shale plays than the North Slope development needed, but that's the scope we're talking about, and so it's something of very -- of significance.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, Tim. That's the way it seemed to me, but I didn't want to presume that you guys were looking at it that way, but it looks like a up.","Timothy L. Dove","It's a lot warmer in West Texas.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","No polar bears. On a little smaller scale. The Wolfcamp A, if I go back to think about the way you guys were talking about that, maybe 1 year or 2 years ago, I think there was a concern there that -- I think, you were confident about the oil in place and that sort of thing, but there was a concern about being able to get effective frac containment there. Can you talk about how that's -- with these 11 wells that you've put online, how do you think you've done on that front? And are you doing anything different in the Wolfcamp A with your frac designs and what you're doing in the Wolfcamp B? And I guess, the natural follow-on to that is given that Wolfcamp A is still in their early innings and is looking so good, is there -- do you think there's more upside there?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, Charles, you have a good memory. From what we said over about 18 months, 2 years ago. We were concerned at the time about frac-ing up into the Dean formation. And I think, this -- by bringing on 11 new wells, all great success, microseismic has showed all the fracs were contained within the A. So very, very positive results. The A does have almost as much oil as the B. So it allows us really to develop the A throughout the North, just as much as the B. So very, very positive results and still getting great results in the Lower Spraberry Shale.","Operator","And we'll move next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, you outlined for us what you expect kind of the rate of return to be from the water investment in your release. Can you give us color on kind of maybe what you expect other investments to generate? Or maybe refresh our memory in terms of how quickly the payback was on the original sand mine investments or the rate of return on that?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes Dave, I think, when we calculated the original sand mine acquisition, we were looking at a 4- to 5-year payout on that project. We acquired that in 2012. And I think it's on schedule. Probably 2 or 3 more years to payout. With the alternative, of course, being, as I mentioned earlier, even regard -- even in regard to our expansion, to have to bring in a large quantity of white sand from the Midwest, which has a lot of complication. Actually, white sand costs at the mine are similar to Brady Brown, but the problem is the costs at least double to bring it in, notwithstanding all the infrastructure issues and logistics that you've heard about with regard to the rail system. So I think, when you calculate the incremental values associated with the expansion, the expansion is relatively cheaper than the original sand mine. It just has to do with we're not acquiring reserve, we're just building a facility. So if we spend $125 million or so on that, I calculate the payout to be probably in the neighborhood of 1.5 years. And so, to me, this is a really outstanding investment when you consider we have decades worth of sand.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then, just one, thinking about budgeting for next year. When you make that budget or as you're going through that process right now, how are you thinking about what kind of improvement you anticipate in well cost and EURs? Or are you going to be using current well cost, current EURs? And can you refresh us on what you think those are for the budgeting purposes?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think, Dave, right now, I think the plan is, is we're giving instructions to our teams is to use the current well cost, use current EURs, and basically, in that sense, be conservative. I think, if you look at the current well cost, to the extent we're out to 9,000, to 10,000 foot laterals, those wells are costing $9 million to $10 million. So I think we have some ability to cut that back as we continue our optimization. We're cutting days off wells as we speak. If you look at this quarter versus last quarter, we didn't give you a lot of color on that. But you'll see incremental improvements. I think, the question is, as we go further towards new casing designs and other things I mentioned with regard to how to complete the wells more efficiently, you'll see the cost come down. So I think, we've got upside when it comes to the cost. On EURs, we have not yet set exactly what will be the zones to be drilled, so we don't even have the rig count set, well count set yet because it's something we're in the process of doing and won't discuss even until February. But that said, if we're in the situation we're in today, we're going to be limiting everything other than let's just say Wolfcamp A, B and Lower Spraberry Shale, you would think that our returns and our EURs and our production rates will be better as we high-grade. We just simply haven't gotten any numbers surrounding that. But as for right now, we're having the teams evaluate that and evaluate what are the best areas, what are the best wells to drill when it comes to economics.","Operator","And we'll move next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You've talked about a $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion here of new infrastructure CapEx over the next couple of years. And in the context of 16% to 21% growth forecast, should we think about this as a truly one-off or is this a good rate of infrastructure spending, or should it be greater, over a longer-term period for these types of projects or others that may come up? Arguably, you'll need more water, you'll need more sand, you'll need additional infrastructure over time.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, Brian, I think, the major expenditure of the water system will be in the next 2 years. The rest of it will be spread out over the 3- or 4-year timeframe. So that's mostly the main trunk line. And so that's going to occur in '15 and '16. The sand mine, we could expand it, but it's going to be way down the road, again, several years down the road, so the major expenditure of that. On the processing plants, I think, if we stay in this $70 to $80 world, that you're going to see significant cut back by third-parties. And that the 12- to 18-month cycle could be pushed back. And so, I think, the processing plants will probably get delayed, not the ones that are coming on in '15 and '16, but that scenario could easily play out that way. And so we're front-end loading with -- what's going to happen is that if rigs are cut back in the first half of the year, you're not going to see any decline in U.S. production until toward the very, very end of '15. So I think the U.S. is going to continue to put 1 million barrels a day into the market over 2015. Permian Basin is a big chunk of it. So I would say, overall, that most of it is going to be '15 to '16. When you get into '17, '18, like on tank batteries, we'll have built out a lot of our tank batteries, and so you should -- we should be getting into development drilling, then going into existing tank batteries, cutting cost there, too. So I'd say more of it is front-end loaded in '15, '16.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you found some limits of the Wolfcamp D zone in Martin County, maybe you could provide more clarity, but it looked like that was probably near the Andrews County border. And I wanted to see if you regard that acreage as being Tier 2 and a limit solely on the Wolfcamp D or whether you regard that as a limit to the horizontal opportunity across multiple zones?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Brian, I'll take it. If you look at the Wolfcamp B mapping that we've done, and we've shown you guys from time to time, it's been about 400,000 acres net that are prospective for the Wolfcamp D on our acreage and only about 10% of that is Tier 2. That is to say 90% of that is Tier 1. So I think, what we're really saying is we've now well-defined the limits. We felt like, from our geologic mapping, that we had a pretty good handle on that but that's why you drill the wells, to make sure you can tie to your geologic mapping. And what I said in the prepared remarks is that, naturally, we're going to be focusing on Tier 1 drilling, but we needed to know that, in fact, our modeling was correct and that we could also evaluate where the edges were of, let's say, Tier 1 versus Tier 2, realizing the Wolfcamp D is deeper, so it has more challenges due to costs because it's deeper as well.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so I guess, is that just the edge of the Wolfcamp D or is that the edge of some of the shallower zones as well?","Timothy L. Dove","No, no ,no. Those different zones are in different areas. I mean, Wolfcamp A and B are basically ubiquitous across the acreage. D is not as ubiquitous across the acreage. Because we calculate Wolfcamp A and B as having 650,000 acres, and I mentioned just a moment ago, the, say, 90% of 400,000 acres would be Tier 1 in the D.","Operator","And we'll move next to Joseph Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just to clarify on your high-grading, so are you in the process of high-grading your drilling activity now in the better formations or are you just waiting to judge how long this lower price oil market is going to last? And kind of follow-up to that is, are you in the process right now of actually increasing activity, adding rigs, and again, you're just going to wait and see how the oil market plays out to decide if you're going drop some of those?","Timothy L. Dove","The answer Joe on your first question, we are not doing what I would high-grading per se along the lines of what you would do in a low price environment for 2014. I mean, our 2014 deal is baked. I mean, our plan is baked. All those rigs are currently running and they're running on the wells that we had scheduled from the standpoint of several months ago. So really, when we talk about high-grading, it's something that's a 2015 event as we crank out a forecast for rig utilization and then what wells are actually going to be drilled. In terms of the rig situation, of course, Scott mentioned, we have sort of a cascading or waterfall approach on rigs. We do have several new rigs coming in, in 2015, that are contracted, some 10 new rigs. Our evaluation will be whether to have those simply replace existing rigs or -- and let existing rigs go or keep existing rigs and build the rig count. So that's the optionality surrounding where we see prices when we have to eventually pull the trigger on that decision, realizing it's not a onetime decision. We don't have to decide on January 1 regarding what our rig count is for the year. We have rigs coming on and off throughout the year, and therefore, we could adjust our rig count on the fly. Obviously, we'd rather have as much of a steady state rig count as we can just to avoid inefficiencies. But we've got a lot of bites at the apple with what exact number of rigs and wells we're going to drill really throughout next year.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful, Tim. And then, the second question is on just completion designs. I know that you are seeing improvement by changing the completion designs. Could you describe what you're doing versus what you were doing before? And where are you seeing the biggest impact? And where are you most optimistic about seeing improvement in productivity with changing the completion designs?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, first of all, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, our completion designs are really the subject of study right now. We've got quite a few optimization studies going and quite a large number of wells that are involved with that right now. And we don't have -- we won't have any answers on that basically until probably well into next year as all that's done. But for example, in Martin and Midland County, we are using similar concepts that we use in the Eagle Ford. So for example, increasing the number of clusters per stage from 4 to 5, and this is actually just reduces the number of stages we're pumping, which is a very big economic effect. We are substantially testing the use of more proppant. Generally, we were at 1,100 pounds per foot, now we're running it up to 1,700 a test. We actually, in the case of Permian, are reducing fluid volumes to try to save money where actually when you do that, pump the same amount of proppant, you're increasing your proppant concentration, which we think could potentially lead to substantial improvements in EURs and production rates. And I think we'll know the results of this only, in the fullness of time, into 2015. But what I expect is I don't any reason we wouldn't see similar results as we have seen in the Eagle Ford where we saw 15%, 20%, 30% improvements in EURs by various combinations of these tests, realizing not every zone will be identical in terms of what we believe is optimal for that particular zone. That's why it's going to take quite a long time before we get to where we really feel like we've got it figured out in every zone.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just to follow up your comment on the Eagle Ford. I know you said 20% to 30% increase, but is that a 20% to 30% increase over what already had been an increase because of new completion designs? And I know it's kind of an ongoing process, there's no clear beginning, no clear baseline, but you've actually been kind of tweaking things and using some of these techniques for a few years, if I understand correctly.","Timothy L. Dove","That's right. I think, if you look at it though, what we have to do is, in the case of this kind of testing to establish a baseline set of wells that then we compare with. So all we're saying is if you look at the baseline wells that were, in most cases, drilled and completed in the way we were first doing it with the proppant concentrations and with the volumes pumped and with the stage configurations, we now offset that with new wells utilizing these new tests and then can calibrate and calculate how much they've improved. Actually, it's the subject of a recent SPE paper that just went out, I think, last week in October, you may want to search out. It tells you exactly how this testing is done and it's the precise -- it's precisely the same kind of testing we're using in the Permian.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up from your prepared remarks. You mentioned service cost and I was curious how you guys are seeing current trends and potentially any initiatives that you have in place to lower your overall cost structure or service cost specifically heading into 2015?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I mentioned, we're in the initial stages of that. We let out a substantial number of contracts for all of our services, both capital and operating costs services, in -- for the upcoming year. Those are the contracts that have been led out, we're evaluating them. I think, essentially, what we're doing is we're going out for a round 2 set of bids to incorporate the fact that commodities appear to have fallen pretty considerably compared to what people were first envisioning. And take another crack at cost reductions with our major service providers across the board. So I'd say, we're kind of in the initial stages of that. That won't finalized until we get a little bit further into the year. But nonetheless, we do expect some significant improvements in cost.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know you haven't set the budget yet, but you clearly indicated you still think we can get to the 16% to 21% growth here over the next couple of years, I guess, corporate-wide. Could you help to maybe put a few parameters on sort of the lower end versus the top end? Is the lower end kind of the 0 incremental northern Midland rigs and the top end closer to 10%? Can you maybe just kind of help us with some of the thinking around that?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes. I mean, that's the range, Leo. I'm sorry. I mean, as Tim says, on well cost, we don't know what -- we're going to know in a couple of months what our cost savings are going to be, which is going to have -- it's really that, coupled with what rig count to start the year with. And so those are the big 2 unknown items, and we've got to wait and see what happens with these 2 events end of November, with the Iran negotiations on nuclear sanctions and, secondly, followed by the OPEC meeting. So those are all big events, we just don't have the data points yet. So that's why we -- you can take our infrastructure and sort of spread it out over 2 years. You know what the current capital is for 2014 and the current rig count and so you could probably back in if you can.","Timothy L. Dove","That would not incorporate any accelerated drilling, if we would choose to do that.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Or cost savings.","Timothy L. Dove","Or cost savings.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. No, that's helpful, for sure. And I guess, you guys talked about high-grading kind of within the northern Midland Basin as a potential outcome at lower oil prices for next year. Should we also assume that you guys may also try to put a higher percentage of activity in, say, northern Midland versus Eagle Ford or southern Midland, can you maybe talk to that dynamic?","Timothy L. Dove","I think, Leo, everything we're doing is based on what the rates of return are per well. And so I think we'll try to high-grade also essentially along the lines of returns. It's one thing to say wells where we have the best EURs. What we're really saying to you, we're going to drill the best economic wells that we have. And we haven't really landed on how many wells that is in which area. We have quite a large number of economic wells in today's environment in the Eagle Ford Shale, needless to say. Same as true in the southern Wolfcamp area, especially in the northern part of the southern Wolfcamp and certainly in the northern Wolfcamp. So I think, that's really the whole product of what we're talking about here, which is basically a capital allocation exercise towards the best returns.","Richard P. Dealy","And Leo, just another factor on that is, and you know this, we've got a joint venture partner in the southern Wolfcamp, we've got a joint venture partner in the Eagle Ford and those discussions are just going on right now.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just to kind of hone in one of the prepared remarks that you all had made here, I know you talked about saving $500,000 a well or maybe a little bit more than that, based on your water system. But I also hear you guys say that you potentially could save another $500,000 from the installation of your saltwater disposal and tank batteries, I just wanted to clarify that?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, as you know, we are installing larger tank batteries to handle the first group of wells over the next 2 years. As you get into '17, '18 drilling, Leo, you can basically go back in and tie those directly into the existing batteries. That's what's happening right now in the Eagle Ford. Eagle Ford costs are down because we're going into existing CGPs. We pretty much have built out all the CGPs in Eagle Ford. So it's the same example, so costs come down.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Congratulations for really leading the way in condensate exports, and we're seeing our first self-classified condensate exports announced today. I mean, but while it's early, do you see a faster pace to crude exports given the preliminary election outcome last night and kind of any roadmap there with kind of next key catalyst? And I have a second question.","Scott Douglas Sheffield","Yes, I'm personally getting more optimistic spending a lot of time in D.C., and we'll spend a lot of time over the next few weeks in D.C. It's our #1 priority to get the export ban lifted next year in 2015. And so with what happened last night, and Senator Murkowski is going to run the Senate Energy Committee. I'm probably much more optimistic that something may happen in '15. We are making headways on both the Democrat and the Republicans, educating them. So right now, Brent goes to $90, $91 in the out years, WTI stays at $80, $81, flat. And so if exports are lifted, I would hope that those 2 trends narrow instead of spread out like they are over the next several years, and so U.S. producers can compete with the rest of the world. And so, I think you'd see a lot of hedging today if WTI had the same strip as Brent going up to $90 a barrel or $91 a barrel over the next several years. So that's the name of the game. We hope to accomplish it in 2015.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And my second question, on the longer-term infrastructure spend, maybe just to follow up with Singer's question. I mean, you clearly map out a moderation of the $700 million to $800 million per annum spend over the next 2 years, yet, any long longer-term guidance as you think about that 10-year plan on an annual spend? And related, with midstream valuations, I mean, why wouldn't you monetize those investments and make infrastructure self-funding on an asset sale basis a couple of years out?","Timothy L. Dove","First of all, if you look at this year, and you can use tank batteries as an example, we spent about $250 million on tank batteries and saltwater disposal. That's a pretty heavy load, going to about $300 million for the next couple of years. I think, you can see that level go for another couple of years after that and start to come down. And overall, realizing what Scott already alluded to, we don't have another sand mine expansion on the docket probably for a few more years. We could accelerate it if we needed to. Gas plants will probably decelerate a little bit. So you're probably getting down, instead of this $700 million to $800 million zone, probably more $300 million or so as you get out in -- or $300 million to $400 million, I'd probably say, counting water in the years 2017, '18. So you'd probably have $300 million to $400 million reduction just because you'll have a lot of the stuff behind you.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And the midstream piece?","Timothy L. Dove","I think, what I would say about that, Scott alluded to this in his commentary a minute ago, and that is, I think, we have to take a look at that. We need to make sure we get all this stuff built in order to be able to execute on our plan. But several of the assets we're talking about building, this would include water and sand and infrastructure and certain gas processing are MLP-able in the fullness of time. So we'll have to just take a look at that when the time comes. It certainly may provide an option for us from a capital markets perspective on these assets.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First thing I wanted to look at, you placed a significantly higher number of wells on production in that Spraberry\/Wolfcamp during the quarter than you all had originally expected. You mentioned it was a big acceleration in the southern Wolfcamp. And then, based on the guidance you all got for POPs in the fourth quarter, it's going to be the first time we've had sort of a sequential decline in POPs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. So just assuming kind of base level same level of activity, wouldn't that indicate we'd have a pretty dramatic increase in POPs in Q1?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, John, I think, first of all, you are right. We did accelerate some costs, mostly because of efficiencies in the southern Wolfcamp area where we're drilling wells faster. I alluded to that in my earlier commentary. We've actually reduced the number of days on wells and that just accelerates your POP schedule. And so what you've seen is wells that were otherwise scheduled in the fourth quarter getting done in the last, say, couple weeks of September. So it's one of the reasons why you look at the fourth quarter production in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and see even further accelerations, because you're going to get the full benefit of that production for the whole quarter in the fourth quarter. But because of that, the fourth quarter POPs look lower as a result, almost by definition of them being moved from the fourth to the third. And I think the real question for the first quarter is, where -- it's the same question, do we get more of these done in the fourth quarter or do they slip into the first quarter. So I don't think that we have a lot of color on the first quarter POPs being any significantly different related in the third or fourth quarter.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, looking at the exporting going from 25% of your Eagle Ford condensate volumes to 50% next year. You had mentioned, Tim, just it's a pretty substantial difference you're seeing here on the pricing. Can you just sort of quantify that?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we're really not prepared because there's some confidential issues pertaining to pricing, needless to say. But if we were to sell this stuff in the U.S. market today only, we would be probably achieving $10.50, $11 off WTI. I can tell you, we're well into the single digits in terms of the discount of WTI compared to that. So it's been a substantial improvement.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eli Kantor with Canaccord Genuity.","Eli J. Kantor - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","It's been a few quarters since we've seen your gun barrel slide in the Permian Basin. Given the exciting nature of the stack pay potential in the Permian, can you just give us an update on those downspacing and staggered lateral pilots and then getting sealed? And as a follow-up, how much of your upcoming Permian activity will test the staggered or stacked lateral format? And do you see any variance in communication or interference between wells in the A, B zone versus wells in lower Spraberry, Jo Mill, and middle Spraberry?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Eli, we certainly are continuing our testing of various spacing regimes. I think, if you take a look at it when we started with this whole project, we were -- everything was predicated at 140-acre spacing. It's pretty clear that the results we've shown so far in our own internal testing would say that we can get down to, easily, 100-acre spacing, maybe in some cases a little less than that. So that's going well. In some of these areas, we're just now beginning to get those results because those are pads that we began drilling the middle part of last year -- of this year, I should say. So it'll be the end of this year before we started seeing a lot more results. We'll be talking more about that in the fullness of time when we have more data. And when it comes to stacking, the one thing we want to make sure of is that we sort of optimize the production from these pads, and so that means we want to make sure that we have wells off production only a limited amount of time while we frac offset wells. And so that may lead us to, in certain configurations, for example, drilling a set of B wells before we drill A wells and so on. So I think we're still really learning about that today. We're learning about what's optimal and the most significant optionality is surrounding making sure that we limit the amount of offset wells that are off production at any given time, as well as make sure that we understand the interference between the wells. Right now, we think, we can easily frac and complete A and B wells, though, in a staggered sense.","Eli J. Kantor - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, Permian Basin has been one of the most active areas for onshore U.S. E&P acquisition activity. Given all the liquidity coming into your balance sheet, would you guys look at using the dry powder to potentially take advantage of the recent decline in asset values?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","No. We have -- the acreage values are still high. We have over 20,000 locations. We've only -- we've purchased very little in 2014, only places where we can buy acreage in the 2,000 to 3,000, 4,000 per acre range to allow us to drill 10,000-foot laterals. So that's the only area that we may see it. So very little capital doing that, all going into primarily infrastructure and drilling on the return side.","Timothy L. Dove","The only thing I'd add to that, Eli, is we are very active in acreage swaps. So situations where we can make sure that by virtue of swapping acreage with other industry participants to be able to increase our lateral lengths out to, say, 10,000 feet versus 5,000 feet, we're swapping acreage in a lot of scenarios.","Operator","We'll move to our next question from Sven Del Pozzo with IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","I'd like to know about Brady Brown crush strength versus white sand and if there's any misconception out there about how resistant it is to crushing?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Sven, if you look at all the different aspects of sand in terms of what makes it API gravity -- API quality sand, it's things like crush factor and sphericity and roundness and so on. If you take a look at Brady Brown and the crush factor as compared to white sand, it's just slightly less when it comes to the crush factor, but nonetheless, API standard. That said, we've been using Brady Brown sand in these deeper zones in the Wolfcamp for years and have never had any issue pertaining to any crush factors. And usually, the data would say it's good up to and probably slightly exceeding 11,000 feet TBD.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Do you resin coat any of that Brady Brown sand that you've got and how much might that cost?","Timothy L. Dove","We're not resin coating it. Others are. You have to get with them as what the cost of it is.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And then, just as to the water that's being sourced, the effluent water that's being sourced, what would they have done with that water? Had they not sold it to you and, I guess, how clean is it when you guys get or what -- do you have to process it further in order to utilize it?","Timothy L. Dove","My understanding is a lot this water is just -- effluent water today is just put on the ground by the municipalities, so it's otherwise being wasted. We will be working with the municipalities to do some water cleanup, so it's ready for our use. But in principle, that's already built into the economics of the projects.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc.","Okay. And is there a way to have a general idea how much it's costing you? I mean, since they were just going to dispose of it anyway, it would have represented a cost to them. So I mean, this just seems like a win for the municipality as well as for you guys. Is there any cost you can help us to understand how much it's costing you to buy that water?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, the pricing terms of our contracts are confidential, as you might guess. But suffice it to say, I think it is a great win-win for the municipalities and for us and for the industry that we can otherwise take water that is unusable and converting it to use that makes sense for the entire industry. And so -- and the municipalities are the beneficiary from a revenue standpoint. So I think it's a long-term win-win. I can't give you the details, of course.","Operator","And we will take a question from Gil Yang with DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","I was wondering if you're going to increase the effort to renegotiate leases so you can drill more horizontal wells and reduce the vertical wells drilling obligation and whether or not the lower price environment are going to help those conversations?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Gil, actually, that was the subject in one of the slides that I had in my slide packet, I didn't really mention it. But we are now moving down from we were about 11 rigs vertically down to about 6 here. Very shortly, we will be at 6 rigs running vertically, of which, 1 of them is drilling water wells for us. I mentioned we're drilling Santa Rosa nonpotable water wells for part of our water supply. So I think the answer is what we're using is we're using cash basically and relatively limited amount of cash to work with the landowners, the lease -- actually, they're the mineral owners in this case to negotiate ways to avoid this continuous drilling obligation situation as opposed to having to drill vertical wells to do it. And we've been very successful in that regard. I think, so successful, we're probably be reducing that vertical rig count further as we get into next year. Probably, we'll have essentially 0 vertical rigs running in a couple of years.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Can you give some idea about how that will change your capital efficiency in terms of production per dollar spend? Will that be a noticeable improvement or is that more in the noise?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I mean, we're just going to be avoiding drilling vertical wells, if that's what you're going with that. And that means we're going to drill that many more horizontal wells, which we think are more efficient from a capital standpoint and from an economic standpoint.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Right. I was just getting an idea of that sufficiency [ph] is a noticeable change to growth or is it more a minor blip?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think, it's significant in the sense that the horizontal wells make such larger volumes. The issue is going to be we can drill and produce vertical wells a lot faster and so -- because you get the pad drilling effect on the horizontal campaign. So it is a tradeoff here. In the long-term, you'd much rather be drilling horizontal wells.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Right. Okay. And second question for Scott is, in terms of the market share battle with Saudi Arabia, is this just a street fight or just an outright market share issue? Or are there other things going on? Are there hidden agendas that you can maybe speak to in terms of maybe driving down price in the U.S. so that they can purchase U.S. assets or just getting the other OPEC guys in line to -- so they all cooperate in terms of controlling the market better? What's the real agenda here?","Scott Douglas Sheffield","No. I think, that's the real agenda. There's been articles written about whether or not they're trying to hurt the Russians or the Iranians, but you have to realize, OPEC is down to just Saudi Arabia, maybe Kuwait and maybe UAE. But when you're trying to negotiate with the bankrupt Venezuelans or trying to negotiate with the Shia in Iraq and Iran, that's going to be -- it's going to be a lot tougher for OPEC to come to an agreement to cut production. So the U.S. is still growing over 1 million barrels a day. Most people has the world growing only 600,000 barrels a day this year because of Europe economy, what China is doing. And so the stimulus, I think, will help long-term, $1 trillion stimulus. And so prices should recover within the next 2 years. But it's going to be really hard for OPEC, I think, to come some type of agreement just because of the status of these various OPEC countries. I didn't add Libya. Who do you negotiate with in Libya to cut production? You got 3 factions, one of them is Al Qaeda-related. So who do you negotiate there to cut production? So it's a lot tougher than it has been in the past. So it's down to Saudi to cut production, they just don't want to do it. So it's putting pressure on the U.S. shale oil revolution.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.

After that, we'll open up the call as usual for your questions.","So with that, Scott, I'll turn the call over to you.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Frank. Good morning. On slide number three, starting off the second quarter adjusted income of $15 million or $0.10 per diluted share, we had already pre-announced on production in the second quarter of 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 51% oil; obviously driven by the strong Spraberry\/Wolfcamp production growth through the horizontal drilling. And then obviously we had announced lower than expected production in the Eagle Ford and West Panhandle field. We're maintaining our production growth forecast of 10% plus for 2015. Obviously, we're increasing the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp full-year growth rate of up to 22% to 24%.","We had already announced closing the sale of the Eagle Ford Midstream business for $2.15 billion. Already received $530 million at closing, the additional $500 million will come in, in July of 2016. In addition, you're already seeing benefit from fee reductions under existing downstream processing and transportation contracts, roughly to Pioneer, a $100 million NPV. We're realizing significant service cost reductions and efficiency gains.","We're showing 20% to 25% already, decrease in drilling and completion costs compared to 2014. We expect capital costs to decline by greater than 30% going into 2016. We're seeing a 20% reduction in horizontal tank battery construction costs; already expect that number to be greater than 25%. 17% reduction already in LOE in the second quarter versus all of 2014.","A couple more comments to give you an idea of efficiency gains. I was out in the field this last week in the Permian Basin. We're already seeing records being set in our Wolfcamp B wells. Our last 10 wells have averaged to drill to TD of 20 days, we actually set a record with a Sale Ranch royal in 13 days. So we're seeing records occur weekly as we're moving forward, especially focusing on one zone, primarily the Wolfcamp B. In addition, if oil prices continue to stay sub $50, I expect the cost that I just mentioned, service costs will be under more pressure to come down even further. So I think we'll get more gains in a sub $50, $50 or sub environment.","Slide number four. 28 horizontal wells placed on production during the second quarter of 2015 in the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. Early production results in the Wolfcamp B from 16 wells are tracking above 1 million BOE equivalent, with an average 24-hour rate of 1,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 79% oil content. Results from the five wells in Lower Spraberry Shale are averaging 1 million barrels of oil equivalent with a 24-hour peak rate of 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent with 81% oil content. So both continuing to average very high oil content.","Tim will talk more about our seven wells benefiting from our completion optimization and what we're doing there. But we're seeing tremendous results from our six Wolfcamp B wells and one Lower Spraberry Shale well. The average production from all the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A wells since 2013 in the north were tracking EURs of 1 million barrels of oil equivalent.","Changing the topic in regard to exporting condensate, we're continuing to export the same amount, 20,000 barrels a day in the second quarter. Obviously, we significantly improved pricing as compared to domestic condensate sales.","We did a spot cargo of 6,000 barrels a day this past June. We're continuing our efforts on lifting the ban. I think we had \u2013 last week was very important in that regard. Both we had comments from the speaker of the House very positive, supporting the export \u2013 lifting the export ban. The Senate actually had a vote in the Energy Committee in regard to lifting the ban. I expect both the House and the Senate, full Senate, full House, to vote on lifting the ban some time in late September or early October on my recent visits.","Something that's helping us significantly and we're getting out the message obviously, if we're allowing Iran to export oil, why not our U.S. producers? In addition, it was disclosed last week that we're importing Russian oil up into the northeast refineries. So why let the Russians export oil to the U.S.? Why allow Iran to export oil and not let U.S. producers? So I'm changing \u2013 I'm getting more optimistic above 50% now.","Going to slide number five, outlook. Strong commodity positions continue to protect cash flow. We probably have the best \u2013 I mean, when you look at 2015, 2016 combined in the industry, we have coverage for 90% of our oil for 2015 at $71. 75% of our oil for 2016 in three ways. And they're pretty much, when you look in the exhibits in back, between $47 and $67, we get $67 with upside to $77. So obviously, if crude stays where it is, even for next year, we're going to get $67 for most of the year for 75% of our crude.","We do have good coverage for gas, again, 85% in 2015 and 65% in 2016. We got a strong balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, debt-to-book, 23%. Obviously, with the close of Eagle Ford in early July, further enhances that. Cash on hand at the end of July is about $700 million. We're planning to add, as we had stated, two horizontal rigs per month in the north during the second half of 2016; also planning to add eight rigs in the first quarter of 2016, six rigs in the north and two rigs in Eagle Ford.","The rig ramp is expected to bring horizontal activity back to the level it was at prior to the oil price collapse in late 2014. We've already added four rigs. The IRRs, which are most important, what are the returns in this type of price environment? The Spraberry\/ Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford range from 45% to 60% at current strip prices, including all costs, tank battery, salt water disposal, capital costs. For example, also in a $50 flat environment, we're still getting 30% to 35% returns.","We have minimal impact on 2015 production, obviously due to the time required to drill and complete these multi-well pads. And we continue, over the 2016 to 2018 period, provide a CAGR production growth rate of 15% plus, with an oil growth rate of 20% plus.","In summary, with a strong balance sheet, world class assets with great returns of superior derivative position through 2016, it gives us tremendous flexibility to adjust the rig ramp based on the company's commodity price outlook and continuing efficiency improvements. One thing I can obviously say, we always get asked what commodity price would you slow down? If oil prices go to $40 and stay at $40, for the next 18 months, obviously, we'll most likely slow down. But as long as our hedge positions and the strip occurs, there's no reason at this point in time to slow down.","Slide number six. In regard to our drilling budget of $2.2 billion that we had announced with the rig adds in the second half of the year, it's broken out about $1.95 billion in drilling; $250 million of other capital, water infrastructure, vertical integration and facilities. Operating cash flow of $1.5 billion, as I mentioned already, $700 million at the end of July.","And also if you look at this chart, for instance, if we get to $40 oil and stay at $40 for the rest of this year, we only lose roughly \u2013 between the Star and $40 oil and $2.90 gas, we only lose about $50 million to $60 million decrease in our cash flow; it's just tremendous. So why make the decision now based on current prices? I'm optimistic by the second half of 2016, that prices will be back into the mid-$50s or even in the low-$60s, with the second half of 2016.","Slide number seven, and our long-term growth rate. We're still at 15% plus from 2016 to 2018, 20% on the oil growth. Our guidance for third quarter, significant increase up to 205,000 to 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we'll be moving from 51% oil to 60% oil over the next three years.","I'll now turn it over to Tim to give more detail on our operations.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott. And I'm going to start with slide eight. As Scott has already mentioned, second quarter did feature a very strong drilling campaign in the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area particularly, and the graphs here on slide eight show that very clearly. You can see, as he mentioned, that the Wolfcamp B wells, 16 in total, are averaging actually well over 1 million BOE per day so far, realizing your vertical scale, there's a log scale. So these wells have done exceptionally well and as he covered as well. But as you look to the right graph, the Lower Spraberry Shale wells are exhibiting probably about 1 million BOE type curve. So they've done exceptionally well.","We did put seven other wells on production in other zones and the statistics are shown there on slide eight. They track essentially where we've been in terms of these zones as well. So when you look at that, it gives us a lot of confidence that the drilling we've done in the past will be representative of what we expect minimum in the future. We also did put on production seven of our 25-well campaign on completion optimization during the quarter, and those results look very favorable. Of course they involve changing the stage lengths and the clusters per stage, profit concentration, fluid pumped and so on.","But those seven wells are very encouraging. And, of course, it's going to take more time for the full evaluation. I expect that over the next couple quarters, we'll be coming out with more data about the actual well results. But suffice it to say, they look very good so far.","Turning to slide nine. This shows the program to-date results for all of the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal wells in the A and B zones. That's now a total of 107 wells. And so we were showing you all the data for all the wells on average. And you can see pretty clearly in the top graph that our numbers are coming in at or above the 1 million barrel type curve for all the As; and the Bs similarly running about 1 million barrels BOE. So it gives us a lot of confidence that we have this consistency across these zones and really across the basin.","If you look at the graph on the right, the map, it shows that we've been drilling the B wells, particularly, over a pretty wide swath of acreage, and the As as well. So it gives us a lot of confidence as we look forward that as we head more towards development mode over the next several years, we'll have, at a minimum, these kind of results to the extent our optimization campaign is successful. I think results could easily outpace what we're showing in terms of the historical data.","Now, turning to slide 10. As we mentioned, we are in the process of ramping up the drilling campaign. Having started it last month, we're now operating 10 rigs in the north. That campaign is showing strong EURs and returns, mostly because of the fact we've gotten substantial cost reductions that Scott already mentioned, but also we're doing a great job as a company in terms of bringing out new efficiencies, we're reducing our time on these wells, our spud to POP times, for instance, has been reduced to about 25 days. That has to do with changing the casing design for these wells and, in particular, drilling only the Wolfcamp B principally as the main zone. Our crews get better and better as they drill just one zone.","We've also seen reductions in the time in terms of the measuring of frac to POP, putting the wells on production going down as well. So we're just getting more efficient, we're getting better. And for that matter, the completions are getting better as well, reducing the average time it takes to pump stages. We're basically pumping more stages per day. So that's all going exceptionally well. We continue to test new technologies, whether it's dissolvable plugs or diversion technologies and, as I've mentioned, at a large campaign for completion optimization.","The well costs now are coming in about $8 million to $8.5 million. That's down of course, and represent the 20% or 25% cost reduction or so that we've already achieved. And I think we can actually move those numbers down as we get into 2016, to over 30%. And this has to do with burning off our tubulars inventory, having rigs come off contract and actually increasing savings along other parameters as well. Returns in the north look exceptionally strong, 50% to 60% based on those 1 million BOE type curves.","As you look at the map on the right, the one thing that jumps out here is the planned number of wells to POP this year continues to be approximately 100 wells, but as you look to the number of wells to be spud, it's now increased to about 100 wells. That's associated with the fact we're increasing the rig count. But at the same time, most of those rigs will have no effect in terms of 2015 production, it'll mostly affect 2016.","Turn to slide 11, in the southern JV area. The story is very much the same. We're now operating four rigs in the area, getting the similar types of results when it comes to improvements in the drilling campaign and strong EURs as well as reductions in time on wells. The wells are a little cheaper in the south, of course, because we're a little shallower. They average about $7.5 million, now having \u2013 have the effect of the cost reductions. I think we can move those down to $6.5 million to $7 million as we get into the next year, again, reflecting the 30% reductions or so. And these wells have IRRs of about 45% measured the same way as I talked with the northern wells.","And as you look at the plan regarding popping wells, we're still popping about 75 to 80 wells. We're well on the way to get that done considering we have 58 that we've done through the second quarter. And then, we plan to spud only 45 wells this year. That's just as a result of a relatively low rig count in the south at four rigs which has limits in every wells we can spud.","Going to slide 12. The strong drilling campaign in the quarter led to a pretty significant increase in production, about 7,000 barrels a day. As you look at the third and fourth quarter forecasts, you see that they're plus or minus flattish compared to two-thirds of our run rate. It'll be up in the third quarter, but flat in the fourth. That has to do with the fact that we reduced our rig count late last year into the first quarter this year. As we now pick that up, you'll see an increase in the trajectory. So I would focus on the 2016 trajectory as being more emblematic of what we can do with a substantial number of rigs working. If you look back to the last three quarters of 2014, that's the type of growth you should be able to see in terms of a trajectory, and we're back to a full campaign of drilling. So overall, it was a strong quarter for our Permian Basin operations.","Now, I'm going to turn to slide 13. Since the first quarter call, we've been receiving a lot of interest from our shareholders and the analyst community about how they should be thinking about our short and long-term infrastructure needs in the Permian. Considering the size of this, the prospect, the size of the field, it is pretty large numbers, but particularly regarding tank batteries and salt water disposal systems and how they fit into the equation.","As we show on the map on the top right of 13, the configuration that we've developed now over the last couple of years, in our acreage, provides for significant opportunities for optimizing this infrastructure in a centralized fashion. So what is shown there on the top right are four sections, each, of course, 640 acres or a total of 2,560 acres. They're lined up in a contiguous fashion north and south, which is the optimal direction for drilling. And the base development assumption for this four sections, we'll be drilling 60 wells on three-well pads covering four different zones in that acreage. And if you look at the needs for tank battery and salt water facilities, they're estimated to be about $25 million in total over the whole development of this acreage including the D&C costs.","So the real point to be noted here is about 75% of our acreage is amenable to this type of development. So that means what you'll be seeing us do is over 200 of these developments in the fullness of time. So that's why we really need to get this right in the upfront, is to make sure that we have this down, and we believe we're doing it efficiently. With this massive area that we're working on, it'll take, needless to say, quite a bit of time to drill this out. I think we'll be spending about $250 million to $350 million each over the next three years for build out of these similar systems.","As you see in the bottom graph, this does involve some upfront spending where the first six wells are a total of about $10 million or about $1.6 million for the infrastructure, while the last 54 wells average only about $300,000. So the average for all the 60 wells comes in about $400,000. The key point is that although we do have some front-end loaded spending, it also reduces the infrastructure capital costs per well over time.","So turning to slide 14. This is just really a real life example of what I just mentioned and it's taking place in the Giddings area, in the northern acreage of the Southern Wolfcamp JV. The first six wells are drilled and facilities were built last year. And since then, 14 more wells have been added at about $300,000 per well and we'll probably put about 12 more wells on production for the rest of this year. So by the end of the year, we will have connected about 32 wells, more than half of the total of 60, and that will be in less than two years.","And so the bottom graph shows the actual trajectory of average costs coming down as predicted; as the last 28 wells are tied in, in the next couple of years at about $300,000 per POP. So given that there's a burden associated with the upfront capital, why develop the infrastructure this way would be the question, and I'll cover that on slide 15.","So the real question is what would be our alternative? The most simplistic way to think about that would be to set smaller tank batteries and smaller saltwater disposal systems to handle each well as it is drilled rather than a centralized approach. And so we've done some calculations as to what that would look like compared to how we're doing it. And so the question is why is our centralized infrastructure method the preferred way to go? Well, you can see it in the two graphs here on slide 15. That's to say what happens when you do it our way is that the total infrastructure costs for the field are lower, the actual upfront capital costs are lower and we get the benefits of three well pad being more efficient, especially on a cost basis.","In addition, because the three-well pad drilling production and cash flow is accelerated and doing it our way also avoids the losses of possible future drilling locations due to surface limitations. You eat up a lot more surface when you place one tank battery per well than the way we do it, and the result can be losing locations. And finally, it reduces the number of offset wells that we have to shut in during completions of wells nearby.","The most important factor though is it increases our net present value of the entire project by about $40 million for each of those 2,560 acres, or you calculate it out on a per-acre basis, about $15,000 an acre. So about $40 million, and that's if you don't lose locations. If you were to lose locations, you could lose \u2013 you could gain $80 million of value. So if you calculate this across our entire acreage position, it's a tremendous amount of value. We think the logic is compelling. And this is the basis upon which we'll continue to develop the massive opportunity we have. I'd ask that if you need more information, feel free to contact Frank and the IR team, and I know they'd be happy to walk you through the assumptions of the analysis.","Let me go then to slide 16. This is a summary of where we are regarding the Permian water system. As you all know, we're planning for a long-term solution to our water needs, the objective of which is to reduce the cost of water per well and also to make sure we have adequate water in the sense of non-potable water. We want to really get to the point we're not using any fresh water if we can do so. The savings of the cost savings per well is significant, probably $500,000 per well. The project, as mentioned, will come on in phases over several years, the first of which is the initial phase we're doing this year which is doing the engineering and right away connecting the Santa Rosa brackish water source that we're already producing, it's about a $70 million project, moving water up from the south into the SWAT area.","The second phase we are commencing here in the second half of the year and anticipate completing it next year, and that's bringing in the Odessa water, it's the effluent water from the City of Odessa, about 100,000 barrels a day. It will be ready later this year into next year. And then subsequent to which we need the subsystems and frac ponds built out to make sure we can get the water to our locations. So the total cost for that project's about $100 million, $60 million of which hits this year and about $40 million next year. But it will, as I mentioned, reduce our purchase and handling costs of water of about $500,000 per well. Do the math on that, that's a payout that's less than two years.","Turning now to slide 17. This slide gives us an update regarding the status of some of our other infrastructure projects. In terms of gas processing, our interest in the Targa system is very important because it gives us a seat at the table to make sure that future plants are built in advance of our throughput needs in the area. And notwithstanding that, it allows us to be confident that we can get our wells hooked up immediately and ready for production. It's improved our contract terms significantly and also, of course, we benefit to the extent that third party volumes are put through the plant as well. This year's budget has about $70 million net to Pioneer for the initial construction phase of the Buffalo plant in Martin County. That's about a 200 million cubic foot per day plant, and for gathering system upgrades. So what we've seen in the Permian Basin is by virtue of spending time on things like field compression, line looping and so on, reducing pressures in the field, we've actually substantially increased gas production.","If you take a look at our data, the fourth quarter Permian Basin gas production is about 13% of total production, in the first quarter it's 15%. That's not because wells are getting more gassy, it's because we're getting better at capturing the gas that's being produced and that's result of reduced line pressures. And so that's been a big positive for us.","The 2016 spending should be similar to this year and it will be in essence put in place to continue what I mentioned, but also to finish the Buffalo plant. That plant should be done later next year. In the sand mine, of course, we've done work this year regarding beginning the expansion. We've done some of the groundwork for that, spent about $25 million this year with the idea of more than doubling the sand mine capacity. Today, we really do not need more sand, but we can see the day when we will. So we put off the completion of the expansion. It will be about a $75 million expansion, and probably don't anticipate it happening any time before, let's say, 2018 or so.","Turning to slide 19 then and Eagle Ford results. Most of our drilling has been in Karnes and DeWitt counties, some of our very best areas. And as a result, we're generating very high returns, about 60% IRRs and 1.3 million BOE EURs in the area. Importantly, we continue our downspacing and staggering program in both the upper and lower targets, and those wells continue to do well. You can see the bottom hand graph on the right showing downspacing results, the difference between a 300-foot spacing versus 500-foot, and they're essentially spot on. So that gives us a lot of confidence that this downspacing is being very effective. And we will be anticipating and expect the increase to rig count to six \u2013 from six to eight early next year.","Well costs have come down significantly, about $6.5 million now. Remember, when we first started up in the Eagle Ford, they were $8 million or $8.5 million. So we've made huge strides there, but we've had about a 20% cost reduction already and expect over 25%. We could get the costs down to roughly about $6 million, we think by early next year. And here we are experimenting with \u2013 although we're in the early days of using new completion technologies that I already mentioned regarding diversion and dissolvable plugs.","Turning then to slide 19, Eagle Ford results for the quarter. Production was down slightly. It had to do with a couple of factors. One was that we put on production nine fewer wells than we anticipated, mostly due to weather. And then as has been documented, we had some wells we put on production late 2014 that were disrupted, that we had too high it turns out of the forecast for their 2015 production from this area. So we're re-evaluating that. So in essence, they came in lower on production than what we had anticipated in the early planning. So we're re-evaluating the drilling in that area until we can understand why those wells have come in at lower rates. And so as a result of all that, we are moving our production growth forecast down to just a slight increase of 1% to 2% for the year.","Ethane rejection continues. This is across the board. Ethane and propane prices are in the tank and, as a result, where we can, we are rejecting ethane throughout our operations.","So I'm going to stop there and pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and his guidance for the third quarter.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks. Tim, and good morning. I'm going to start on slide 20 where we show we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $218 million or $1.46 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses of $222 million or $1.48 per diluted share. And then we also note on this slide here unusual items that aggregate $11 million or $0.08. So adjusting for mark-to-market unusual items, we were at $15 million or $0.10 of earnings. The unusual item, the biggest item that was our previously announced restructuring that we did in the Raton asset team and the closure of the Denver office.","Looking at the bottom of the slide where we show Q2 guidance versus results, we've talked about production, we'll talk a little bit more about production costs in a slide or two. The one item to note is DD&A came in above the high end of the range that we'd put out, really resulting from lower commodity prices which had the effect of shortening the economic life of our producing wells. This resulted in a negative price revision to proved reserves which caused our depletion expense to be higher than we anticipated.","Turning to slide 21, looking at price realizations. You'll see on the bars there that oil prices during the quarter were up 20% to $51.64. NGL prices were down 6% to $14.03 and gas prices were also down 12% to $2.37. When you look at the tables underneath those bar charts and particularly at the derivative ones, you'll see there our derivative position, as Scott mentioned, has paid big dividends for the company over the last number of quarters. For the second quarter, we added $150 million of cash for the quarter as a result of our derivative position.","Turning to slide 22 on production costs. You can see that for the quarter, production costs came in at $11.19, down 11% from the first quarter, primarily driven by decreases in our base LOE, good work from the asset teams and their cost reduction initiatives. Mainly on fuel, electricity, oilfield supplies and services were the major items. So in total, we're down, as Scott mentioned, 17% from our average production LOE cost per BOE in 2014. And then obviously production in ad valorem taxes with a decline in commodity prices are also down quarter-on-quarter.","Turning to slide 23, liquidity position. We continue to have an excellent balance sheet. You see we had net debt at the end of the quarter of $2.5 billion, $219 million of cash on the balance sheet that was supplemented by the closing of the midstream sale in early July. That added $530 million of cash. So at the end of July, we're now sitting at a little over $700 million of cash on the balance sheet, and expect to get another $500 million in July of next year. Plenty of liquidity with unsecured credit facility availability of $1.5 billion. So all-in-all, great financial position as we move into the second half of the year.","Switching gears and moving to slide 24. And talking about third quarter guidance, production expected to be 205,000 to 210,000 BOEs per day for the third quarter. Production costs, our guidance here is up slightly from where we came into the second quarter, mainly because of the sale of the EFS midstream that we've talked about in past quarters. That will cause our production cost to increase about $0.75 to $1 per BOE. So that's reflected in the guidance.","Other thing in guidance that's of note is DD&A. You'll see that's up also reflecting that we were another quarter of lower commodity prices which we expect to have some more negative price revisions to reserves. Other expense, $45 million to $55 million includes $20 million to $25 million of stacked rig charges. That is down from the second quarter of $28 million of stacked rig charges reflecting the rigs reporting back to work. And then the other item of note is current income taxes of $45 million to $55 million. This reflects the alternative minimum tax that we'll have to pay associated with the EFS midstream sale. We were able to shelter regular tax, but we'll have some AMT to pay. So that's reflected in that $45 million to $55 million estimate.","So with that, we'll stop there and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, thanks for all the color on the infrastructure costs. But I wonder if I could try, and I know you've tried to kind of dumb it down a little bit. But I wonder if I could try and ask you to dumb it down even further? If you look at the proportion of total capital, which is on infrastructure in the current year, I want to say it's about 30% or something like that. How would you expect the proportion of infrastructure spending to trend over your planning period? I don't know if that's an easy question to answer.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks. Well, first of all, I already \u2013 our tank battery and salt water disposal expenditures are going to continue probably for the next three years at the rates I've mentioned. So those are just required to start building out these four section developments as we continue the campaign. As you look at, for example, the gas processing facilities, we'll probably be spending a similar amount next year as this year. That's to complete the Buffalo plant. We don't have any further gas plants on the horizon after that. And so I think it's safe to say it'll be some time before that $70 million or so reoccurs after 2016.","And then from the water plant standpoint, I think the first tranche being the Odessa project is something we're going to do and we're going to complete that next year. It's only a small amount next year relatively speaking. After that, all bets are off. We're going to evaluate what's the proper next step based on how the conditions are on the market, what water needs we have, where we need the water, what the well economics look like in terms of next steps on water supply. So we can do that ratably, we can just do it piecemeal and we could get a hold off a lot more capital on water if that's what we choose to do.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. I appreciate that, Tim. My follow-up is \u2013 it's related to the rig count relative to what you've previously been targeting, which was I guess kind of gets you back to where you were, as you said, in your previous release in terms of the number of rigs. But I'm going to use an Oxy example, if I may. They originally were targeting 50 rigs by 2018. And now what they're saying is, you know what, we can do the same amount of work with 25 rigs. We'll never get 50 rigs. So kind of the same question to you with 36 rigs by the end of the first quarter, what's the pace of POPS, if you like? And do you \u2013 I know you've only just given us up those numbers. So it's a bit unfair to ask what happens next. But obviously, there's a lot of cash flow comes with the growth trajectory. So what is the kind of medium-term plan beyond the first quarter? So efficiency, what do you get with the 36 rigs, and what's the plan beyond the first quarter through your planning period? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Doug. I sort of alluded to that in the opening slide and then finishing up a couple slides later. The thing we're seeing is that we're budgeting somewhere between 28 days and 30 days to spud to TD of these wells, Wolfcamp B wells. And so we've had our last 10 wells at 20 days, we had one at 13 days. If we continue to see that number come down, obviously, we can drill the same number of wells, get the same production growth with less rigs. So obviously that would happen with us as well. We need to see the efficiencies continue before we make that decision. Obviously, we'll be flexible. With our best balance sheet and our best superior derivatives, we have a lot more flexibility. So you may see at some point in time us add less rigs. It won't be because of the commodity price, it'll be because we're drilling these wells in 20 days, 22 days on average. So hope that answers your question.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So should we really think about you at some point living within cash flow, Scott, or how are you targeting the spending, I guess, is really what I'm trying to get at.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, what \u2013 I've looked at almost all of our peers. Almost all of our peers are two times to four times debt to cash flow. We're essentially a little over one. So obviously, we have more firepower than almost all of our peers. We have a better hedge book. We have more cash on the balance sheet. So we're going to use that cash. We will use our balance sheet somewhat to a point going into 2016. So we have lots of flexibility.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. I'll leave it there, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Scott, if I could just pick up a bit on Doug's question there, and I know you guys have been asked these questions a lot of ways. But you obviously have the returns at the well level to justify the investment, and you're in the great position with all these recent asset sales that you've got a relatively under-levered balance sheet with cash. But what is the \u2013 it sounds like the objective function for you guys is you're looking for growth. And I'm wondering if that's \u2013 if that is the objection function, what are the constraints? Is it \u2013 in the near-term, is there a dollar amount in excess of cash flow that you're thinking about that you're comfortable spending? And then as that moves over time, at some point, what becomes relevant constraint? Is it debt to EBITDA or how are you thinking about that over the three-year timeframe?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, it's important \u2013 we think it's important to bring our NAV forward. It's important to show growth as long as we're having very good returns. We have stated debt to cash flow publicly of 1.5. Maybe we go to 1.6, 1.7 at some point in time. At the same time, we have a lot of flexibility, we have obviously other assets to divest of to look at. And so right now, we see under this current environment, in the strip environment, no need to do anything else except execute. And we think we'll get better production growth than we're actually showing with the results that we're continuing to see in the Wolfcamp B and the Lower Spraberry Shale. So it's really beginning the growth. We're targeting the 15%, but we've got to have great returns. At the end of the day, we've still got to have a good balance sheet.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Scott. And then, if I could move onto the development pattern that you guys laid out here with the four stack sections and the 30 wells across a section, I'm curious if you could elaborate a bit on, I guess, how many different zones you see contributing to this 30 wells across a section? And I guess as kind of a backward way of asking of what your assumed spacing in a section, the lateral offset to the section, are there? And if there's possible upside to that \u2013 I'm sorry, not 60, but 30 wells across a section.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Charles, it's Tim. It's actually 60 wells covering the entire four sections, drilling both northward and southward. So we're clear on that. And the way I couch that was four different zones. That's just a model we would look at today. I mean, if you look at our well results so far, it's pretty clear that we've proven up the Wolfcamp B, the Wolfcamp A, Lower Spraberry Shale, a lot of cases in Middle Spraberry Shale. We have a lot of options, of course, Wolfcamp D, depending on where we are and what is the optimal zone to be drilling in the area we are. But this is just one model.","If you look at the spacing assumption here, it's about 600 feet to 660 feet spacing is what's assumed in there, if you just do the math. That wouldn't necessarily be definitive. It's possible we could come in slightly inside of there. But the other thing to note is, we have room in here to come back to other zones as well. So we're not limited to only four zones. This is just the pattern we're drilling and what we would say would be the optimal four zones in an area.","So we can come back and drill other zones from the same acreage position and do that perhaps a little bit later. You have to realize, Charles, each of these four sections takes \u2013 if you just do the math, 60 wells and $8 million, you're dealing with nearly $0.5 billion to develop 2,500 acres. So we'll only get to the best zones first, I guess, the way I would look at it, but we have space to go back to the other zones.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yeah. That's helpful, Tim. And when you say space, if I understand you correctly, that's really you're talking about surface, space on the surface pattern to come back in and get those zones.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Correct, correct.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani from RBC.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Just a question here on the 2015 overall production growth. You guys talked about 10% plus. Are you guys adjusting for the divestitures that you had in 2014 to get to the 10% plus, or is that just a straight calc on the 2014 production versus the 2015 production?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Leo, it does include those divestitures being taken out.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Now that's helpful. And I guess, obviously, I know it's early days, but you guys did talk about encouraging results from seven of your new Permian wells that you used enhanced completion designs. Is it \u2013 do you have enough data yet to say if those wells appear to be performing better than kind of the existing wells at this point in time?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, of course, we're not ready, Leo, to give you a whole lot of data on that until we have more definite data and in fact more data on more wells. But suffice it to say, where we would have been averaging 1,900 IP or 24-hour peak rates on Wolfcamp B wells, we're easily seeing well over 2,000 on those wells that are affected by the completion optimization. So I'm not going to give you specific numbers, but see pretty significant bumps. And we just need a little more data, a bigger data set in order to sort of calculate averages, but I can tell you as well over 2,000 as an example compared to the average.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And I guess you guys also talked about some longer-term asset sales to keep the balance sheet strong. Would some of the midstream infrastructure you're building out over the next couple of years be a critical part of that? Any other kind of high level color you can provide there?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Leo, I'm just trying to address the long-term question, if for some reason, we will continue to do what we have the last three or four years to make sure we keep a great balance sheet. We do have three other assets that we could divest of over time. There are no plans at the current time to do anything.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess you guys also talked about a 900 MBOE EUR in the southern Wolfcamp, which was a nice bump. Just trying to figure out if that's the whole southern Wolfcamp or just the northern part of the southern being the best part there?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. We're drilling mostly in the north and what we're reflecting on is the results in the north.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Congrats on a good update. Just curious, as you push on this, the rig ramp plan, you've been focused on single interval here, more so with the Wolfcamp B. Does that focus change as this rig ramp escalates? And how do we think about kind of maintaining the efficiencies you've seen so far as you keep pressing on the gas bill?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, over time, Michael, you'll see us do some A, sprinkle in some As in Lower Spraberry Shales. We're seeing great results from both also. But, obviously, we don't want to sacrifice our efficiencies, but hopefully the As in the Lower Spraberry Shales can be drilled the same amount of drilling spud time as we're seeing in the Wolfcamp Bs.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. And then on the centralized facility versus single well case, that was helpful case studies to lay out for us. Just to make sure I'm clear, are you building out the facilities for all 60 wells initially, or is that \u2013 are those in kind of modular pieces?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. What we do \u2013 and I kind of mentioned this, Michael, when I was going through those slides, is that we build out, first of all, a tank battery. That's a relatively large tank battery to handle the first six wells, in addition to which we then come back in on individual wells and put in separation and basically production lines and that's substantially lower. So after the first six wells are put in, we have relatively lower capital going in, actually probably $300,000 per well just for separation and production facilities as opposed to the $10 million upfront to get the first six wells on.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Got it. That makes sense. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess it's been touched on a little bit in terms of potential sources of future capital. But in the context of the centralized facilities, you had mentioned that maybe 75% of the acreage was amenable to that sort of development. I'm just trying to think, if the other 25% isn't at a structural economic disadvantage relative to the whole inventory and, therefore, might be \u2013 you might be willing to think about monetizing small pieces of the acreage that don't fit in as well from a contiguous standpoint or some other characters.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael, first of all, we're trying to block in through small deals, transactions and get contiguous tracks through acquisitions. We've been averaging $20 million, $25 million, $30 million a year the last two or three years, and we'll continue to do that at very low acreage cost. Your bigger picture question, we have always been open and that's another source of capital, is looking at selling a portion of our fringe acreage. The transactions \u2013 there's been three transactions that I've seen over the last 90 days that people are continuing to pay $30,000 to $35,000 per acre in good Tier 1 acreage. And so if we can get those type of prices, that is another source of capital that we would be willing to look at besides divesting of our three assets.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. That's helpful. It certainly seems to make sense. And then on the \u2013 you had great LOE improvement. Is that sort of 2Q level sustainable? Just kind of modeling type question.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's sustainable other than for the increase from the EFS midstream that we talked about that will...","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Right.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...lose the benefit of that cash flow. So it will be, like I said, a $0.75 to $1 bump.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The other thing that's happened there with electricity, of course, is we're tending to go more towards gas lift, which is a pretty significant cost saver.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks. Appreciate the time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Freeman from Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. You'd previously talked, Scott, about how you were looking at 28 days, 30 days spud to TD, and now you got these recent wells at more like 20 days and obviously the one that was 13 days. If I look at it kind of a little bit different angle, if I look more just kind of spud to POP times and look at your preliminary growth guidance that you've given for kind of 2016\/2018 timeframe, does that assume that the spud to POP times in the Permian, for example, just stay in the kind of 140-day to 160-day range, or do you in that kind of preliminary guidance assume additional efficiency gains?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, it's still assuming the 140-day to 160-day timeframe. Just that we \u2013 the drilling is what we're seeing the quicker efficiency gains and obviously you end up spending and drilling a lot more wells, spending more capital if you can drill these wells in 20 days versus 28 days to 30 days. So that's why we're watching that piece a lot closer.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just the one follow-up for me, when we look at kind of the current well costs and I guess right now just look in the northern area at the $8 million to $8.5 million and then the goal to get it down kind of $7.5 million to $8 million by early next year, I mean, it seems like a good bit of that you've bridged almost just by itself at least if the numbers have held from what you-all previously said about $300,000 a well in savings just on the dissolvable plugs. Is there another kind of big ticket item like that, or it's more just, from that point, just efficiency gains?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think \u2013 I would tap the brakes on that being \u2013 the dissolvable plug technology being that which we could calculate across all the acreage. We're really testing that, John, in just a handful of wells. I think it really has more to do with the fact that when we ran the big rig ramp-up last year, we've built a pretty substantial tubulars inventory that we're just burning off; we certainly burn it off faster with the rig count increasing. But I don't anticipate really being in the market for a lot more tubulars until we get it right at the end of the year and into next year. Those tubulars are going to come in 25% less than where they were. So that's kind of in the bag in terms of a cost reduction we can count on. It's not incorporated in the numbers today.","The second thing that happens, especially as we get into 2016, is we have rigs coming out of stack, off contract. And to the extent those were replaced with spot rigs, those were easily 20% savings in terms of spread rates. And we're not seeing that today as you know, because we are, in effect, taking rigs right out of the stack at the old rate. And so accordingly these things are kind of in the bag. I think we could say with a lot of confidence those are coming. We've just got to get the fullness of time behind us and we'll see those cost reductions.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Looking at slides eight and nine, can you talk in more detail about the 16 Wolfcamp B wells that you brought on in the quarter that got the very substantially or substantially above 1 million BOE rates? I guess, six of them looked like they were the results of the completion optimization program, but can you add some more color on the others whether there are regional sweet spots, where on the map on page nine they were, they were concentrated or if they were equally spread out?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think you see kind of a statistical result that you expect. You see some particular wells in the same areas doing better than offset wells and vice versa. And so I don't think there's anything particular. I think what we can say, and Scott really alluded to it, the Sale Ranch area up in Martin County has got really some simply outstanding results. Many of those wells, well over 2,000 BOE per day. Our Hutt area continues to produce well, with the wells producing on a 24-hour basis in the neighborhood of an average of, say, 1,600, 1,700 barrels a day. So it's statistical, but there are certain areas like Sale Ranch which are really over-performing.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then back to the, I think, first question on what happens if your drilling days fall and you're left with the decision of whether you want to complete more wells with the same rig count, spend a little bit more money, but then grow more versus drop rigs, same wells, same growth. How do you think about how to make that decision? Or what metrics do you look to, to say, you know what, let's keep our rig count and grow more versus the cut CapEx or \u2013 I'm sorry maintain CapEx and drop rigs?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brian, we're focused on the 15% production growth number at the end of the day to have a great balance sheet. So those are the two driving \u2013 along with obviously getting different \u2013 great returns. So those are the drivers. So for some reason, we have a choice to go to 20%, 25% production growth and spend a lot more money, take more balance sheet risk, we'll probably not do that.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I'd kind of add to that Scott by saying, to add rigs, what we're doing is taking them out of stack, Brian. We're not adding new contracted rigs. And so therefore if the rigs we have running are way more efficient, you just take less rigs out of stack. That's the way I'd think about it.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And is it fair to say if we take the amount of production you have hedged divided by the 75% that you're basically guiding towards the plus, or emphasis on the plus in your guidance for next year?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't given \u2013 yeah, we haven't given out 2016 guidance yet. But I think over the three-year timeframe, it could be a plus obviously with the efficiencies and everything else. But the same time, we're not going to push the 15% number, especially with these type commodity prices and these type risks until things reset, supply demand resets worldwide.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Mike Kelly from Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me in here. Curious, Leo kind of already hit on this, but we'd like to get your thoughts on the longer-term strategy with these infrastructure and assets in the Permian, and why or why not these would ultimately be good assets to monetize the potential timing, what would make sense? And then just specifically, curious if in your opinion, these tank batteries would be a good fit for an MLP portfolio? Thank you.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike, this is Tim. I think starting with the tank batteries. The tank batteries and salt water disposal systems are really pertinent to the wells. And they're one and the same essentially. So I don't see that at all as being a future candidate. However, when you start looking at some of our other infrastructure projects, this would include sand, it would include water, it would potentially include gas processing facilities. They could theoretically be candidates. The real question, for example, in gas processing is that we benefit a lot from having a seat at the table. You can refer back to my comments on that. And so to the extent we need to build out more, having a seat at the table, is a positive. And when we feel like it's the right time, that would be an excellent candidate.","I think we would also say that about the water system and the sand mine, realizing that neither one of those have been expanded yet and, as a result, are not yet at their peak EBITDA. So given the fact that those are probably sellable based on the multiple of EBITDA, it wouldn't make sense to do it today. So one thing we want to make sure is these things do get built, they get built on our timeline with our flexibility, the example's the water system. We can slow it down as much as we want to in the face of the situation where we have low commodity prices. And so we have all the flexibility in the world to make those decisions and go as fast or slow as we need to, that's true of the sand mine as well. And so we want to maintain that control especially when we have the kind of volatility we've got.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Okay. Fair enough. And Tim, maybe switching gears a little bit, but on the enhanced completion front, I think if you go across the industry here in different basins and even in the Permian, you've seen pretty staggering upticks in terms of what ultimately you are sort of projected to be at with an enhanced completion program. And it's not exactly clear in terms of what's apples to apples for comparing what the base reference point is. But I was hoping you could give some context on that. Are you guys \u2013 are these really very big changes in terms of what you're doing on the completion side here versus kind of the base case standard completion? Or is it more on that? It's a just modest uptick in terms of ultimate expectations versus KNOC (01:01:07) on the other side of the basin talking about 60% to 70% upticks and 180 day rates? Maybe just provide some context. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the first answer to that question is it's too early for us. We've got so much work to do in terms of optimization. This is not true, not just only this 25-well campaign as we look to the future with all these zones. Of course, they all behave differently under completion and so on. So we've got \u2013 we have a laboratory that'll be working for a long time on this question. But I think the most simplest way to deal with is anecdotally and looking from the standpoint at our best analog, which is Eagle Ford. And Eagle Ford, of course, we publicize a similar program where we could pretty easily document simply because you're dealing with 300 foot of shale. And depending upon which area, anywhere between 15% and 30% increases in EUR in a situation where because of the increased completion at 5% to 10% capital cost bump. So that's Eagle Ford shale. We were successful there. I anticipate us being successful here. But to give you an exact number, it's just way too early. But I told you, we're encouraged and gave you a couple numbers to say we're seeing rates which are indicative of substantial bumps in EURs if you believe that there's a strong correlation between production, especially early production in EURs which we do.","Michael Kelly - Global Hunter Securities","Great. Thanks, Tim. Good update, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking me on. So guys, I know most of your plan's pretty well set as far as the rigs you mentioned in the Perm added. I guess just my question is, if you have some of the success over in the Eagle Ford, particularly with some of this Upper Eagle Ford potential, any thoughts about would that change any plans potentially in 2016, or are you pretty well set now with the 12 rigs coming on in the Perm and what you have going on in the Eagle Ford irrespective of results?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","None that is irrespective of respects. I mean, we're going to look at how the wells perform. In Eagle Ford, we've had quite excellent results as I've mentioned. Of course, right now, we're sort of targeting in on the two-rig add and that will be focused on both Upper and Lower targets as well as the staggering and spacing concept. But that's because we're drilling excellent wells. I think we'll always be in the business of allocating capital to the best returns is what it amounts to regardless of the basin.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And then in that Eagle Ford, just so I'm clear, are you going to be drilling some Upper and Lower on the same pads and that will further improve the costs on some of those?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes. That's right.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Robert Christensen from Imperial Capital.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC","Yeah. My question is why not do more in the Lowe Spraberry, it's less depth and probably less cost in this environment and you've had some very good wells this quarter, material uptick from what you drilled in the second half last year there. So it's question one.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, of course, as \u2013 I think Scott already mentioned that to you that where we really had not anticipated doing any Lower Spraberry Shale wells in this year's campaign, Bob, most of it's because of wanting to stick to zones which we're very predictable. The more we see the Lower Spraberry Shale, the more excited we get. And in fact if you take a look at this year's campaign of the 100 wells that we now plan to spud, that's up from the earlier campaign because of the new rigs. About 10% of those will in fact be Lower Spraberry Shales. And so, yeah, we agree with you, Lower Spraberry Shale is great. It calculates us having the most oil in place of any of the zones. If anything, it's complicated by the fact you've got offset vertical wells in the area that need to be considered, but, overall, the productivity looks quite outstanding.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC","My second question is, I guess, high level. So you're going to be capable with 18 rigs as of the end of the first quarter of 2016 to grow at these 20% growth rates through 2018. Without incremental rigs, we draw a line, end of the quarter of first quarter of 2016, and we're going to be capable of growing at 20% plus oil through 2018.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","That's correct.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. And to tack on to that, do you hit escape velocity? In other words, provide enough cash flow off the first two years of this effort to live within cash flow under sort of $60 oil, which I think is the strip out in 2018. Do we hit sort of a escape velocity?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If it gets up to $60 and stays there, we're in tremendous shape, Bob. So with a 30% drop in cost, a $60 oil price environment, you'll see significant growth coming out of Pioneer.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC","But within cash flow in, let's say, living within cash flow in like 2019, I realize there are so many moving parts here. But I think if we could feel comfortable...","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we'll probably \u2013 by the end of the three years, we'll probably get to neutral cash flow in that type of environment if 30% \u2013 the well costs stay down 30% plus.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate the detail, and this is in many ways a follow-on question, even to the previous one about high-level strategy. Listening to you, I was reminded about the old joke about two hunters meeting a bear and the one guy says, you can't outrun a bear, and the other guy says, no, but I can outrun you. And I guess the idea of my question is, at a highest level strategy, do you see yourselves as part of the global market share war that we're seeing in the industry and that you're just going to outrun it and survive it? Or is the aim here to sort of growth to the point where you show within financial reason your long-term potential is so significant that you can sell Pioneer to a higher bidder? So I guess I'm ultimately asking, why don't you pursue more of a return strategy than a growth strategy right here?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Number one is a return strategy. So we stated we're getting 45% to 60% returns at the strip prices. So that's the number one driver. The second driver is to bring our NAV forward and it just happens to get we get substantial growth with that, at the same time maintaining a great balance sheet. So we think \u2013 I personally think shale oil will out survive LNG projects around the world, it'll survive new exploration projects, they'll survive essentially all other shale plays in the U.S. in the Midland Basin. And so the world needs the Permian Basin. And so eventually supply demand's going to reset. And the longer it stays lower, oil prices are going to bounce back even quicker. It's going to be very volatile the next several years. So that's the focus of the company.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. That's just a very clear and simple answer. So I guess you are ultimately part of the market share war and you're going to run faster than the LNG, Hunter and everyone else out there?","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. You've answered it. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Scott Sheffield for closing or additional comments.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll probably just add a good closing remark, so in that last question. So again, I look forward to everybody on the road. Have a great last month of the summertime and we'll see you in September with the start-up of the conferences. Look forward to seeing everybody in November and report our next quarter's production. Thank you very much.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference, and we do thank you for your participation."],"17228":["Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Anna, and good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be the first speaker. He's going to provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2016. It was another great quarter for Pioneer, which saw the company continue to deliver solid execution and outstanding performance. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our latest outlook for Pioneer through the end of this decade and discuss our 2016 capital program and the production forecast through 2020. Joey will then review our continuing strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency improvements in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp as well as the drilling plans for this asset through the remainder of the year. Rich will then cover the third quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. And of course, as always after that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott, but not without highlighting that this will be Scott's last earnings call as CEO of Pioneer after leading the company for more than 30 years. I know that I speak for Pioneer's management committee and all of our employees in wishing Scott and his wife Kim a very happy and healthy retirement. We'll miss you, Scott. So over to you.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. As Frank said, as most of you all know, this is my last earnings call after 25 years of being public. I want to extend a special thanks to all shareholders and to all analysts on the call and our great relationship that we've had over the years. I'd like to give a brief message before I review the first two financial and operating highlight slides. As a continuing large long-term shareholder and board member, I have 100% confidence in Ken and the management team that we'll continue to make this company the premier shale company in the world. We have the best rocks and balance sheet and the best employees in the industry. What company can easily grow 15% per year for ten years and move up to over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in a $47 to $57 oil price environment?","If you look the Permian only, that growth is well over 20% over those ten years. What company has over 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent with over 20,000 locations at an average net revenue interest of 85% and essentially has zero basis on those locations except for the recent Devon transaction, in an environment where companies are paying $40,000 to $60,000 per acre. In addition, we are growing our oil mix from 57% this year to 62% next year and over 70% over the next 10 years.","With regard to oil prices, we are obviously not out of the woods yet. I give OPEC a 40% chance of reaching an agreement on November 30 and, if they do, everyone will cheat. I've seen this over my 42-year career. The market will not balance until 2018. That is why Pioneer is best positioned among all companies, with great hedges in place for 2017 and the best balance sheet in the industry.","Now we will go to slide number three and financial and operating highlights. We had adjusted income for the quarter of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter production, 239,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 56% oil, above Pioneers guidance range of 232,000 to 237,000, an increase of 6,000 barrels a day or 3% versus second quarter, obviously driven by the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal program and our completion optimization program. We did have unplanned downtime at Fain gas plant, which affected the quarter by 2,000 barrels a day from West Panhandle production.","We did place 46 horizontal wells in production in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp during the third quarter, with strong performance, including 28 wells from 3.0 Version. Again, the 3.0 Version significantly outperforming 2.0. We did expand our 3.0 from 80 wells to 100 wells, continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, again, through completion optimization, longer lateral lengths, enhancing well productivity. Drilling completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are continuing to drive down cost per lateral foot.","On slide number four, reduced production cost per BOE by 6% since second quarter of 2016 and 32% since third quarter of 2015. And, yes, as some people may question, our horizontal Permian operating costs are $2 excluding taxes. Enhanced Martin County acreage position by closing purchase of 28,000 net acres from Devon for $429 million. With the export ban removed last year, we did sell our first two Permian oil cargoes for export to Europe in the third quarter. We were paid mid-July a debt maturity of $455 million with cash on hand. And with the recent run-up of course obviously three or four weeks ago with oil prices, we did increase our 2017 derivative coverage to 75% for oil and 55% for gas, up from 50% from last quarter.","I'll now turn it over to our next CEO, Tim Dove.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Scott. I share Frank's good wishes for you going forward. As we've been discussing for some time, we are in the midst of increasing our horizontal rig count. We have a couple more rigs that need to come in November to complete the total addition of five rigs. That'll put us with 17 rigs in the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp area by year end.","Our capital program remains essentially unchanged. It's been that way for some time since the Devon transaction was announced of $2.1 billion. The rigs that I mentioned a moment ago will not really have any significant production adds until 2017. However, just the fact that we're improving our productivity in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp field area with the horizontal drilling campaign and completions optimization is allowing us to actually increase our forecast for this year's production from 13%-plus to 14%-plus.","We see now, even with the 17 rig count maintained flat, that we would expect to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% next year. Really what we're finding, of course, is we can continue to do more with less as we continue to optimize our program. The 2017 campaign of drilling is well-funded already, with our balance sheet on the one hand and also, as Scott had mentioned, our strong derivatives position having been built up considerably over the last few weeks and our cash flow assumptions based on strip prices.","Current 2017 capital budget is far from finalized. There's a lot of discussions, of course, that are ongoing with our partners and internally as to where we're going to land the budget. But suffice it to say, we're currently looking at numbers that are in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion for 2017.","One of our more critical messages in this whole presentation is in the yellow box at the bottom of slide five and it's the fact that, as Scott had mentioned, we're on a plan here to increase our annual production growth rate to about 15% for several years and, in doing so, keeping exceptionally strong balance sheet, in this case net debt to operating cash flow below 1x, even using only strip prices. And in addition to which, if we grow production at that 15% rate, our actual compound annual growth rate of cash flow exceeds that and is approximately 25%. That has to do with drilling projects that are high-margin, oil-based in terms of their returns.","And one of the major components of this is, and our internal modeling certainly supports the fact that we can do this while spending within cash flow as early as 2018 and that's assuming about a $55 per barrel oil price case. So this is what we're focused on really for the next several years, one of the main components of which is at minimum, cash flow neutrality, which as I said I think we can reach 2018.","Turning now to slide six. I mentioned a moment ago our capital budget remains essentially unchanged in 2016 at $2.1 billion. The splits, as shown on this slide, are also essentially the same. Our cash flow number appears to be coming in as we had projected, maybe $1.5 billion. With cash on hand, we easily can fund this $2.1 billion this year. As we look forward, we would say the same thing about 2017.","Turning then to slide seven, and this is our production growth forecast and history. You can see that essentially we're right on schedule when it comes to our production growth. The new forecast for 2016 being moved up to 14% from 13%, as I had mentioned. That gives us approximately a new number of 233,000-plus BOE per day.","If you look at the quarters, quarter three was, again, substantially above our range. The fourth quarter production range we show here is a bit of an estimate only because, as has been evidenced by some of our earlier commentary and the material Frank put out last night, we have had an upset at our Fain plant in the West Panhandle field area. That is in the process of being rectified, but it's unclear how many more days that's going to take before we can get to full production. So what you see here is us being relatively conservative to make sure that we can get that plant back and in full operation.","But as you look forward, and if you look towards the future growth, we're reflecting on this slide the 15% CAGR growth rate through the end of the decade. If you do the math on this, this gets us over 400,000 barrels a day by 2020. And oil growth is, of course, a considerable component of that. There's been some discussions and questions that are raised by where we came out in terms of our oil content of production for the third quarter, showing it 56% where we had 58% in the second quarter.","This is relatively easily explained by the fact that we put in our targeted gas plant in the Martin County area, referred to as the Buffalo plant, in April of this year. And, of course, in doing so, we had to assess and project what sort of NGL recoveries we could get from that plant. It turns out they were substantially better than what we thought and so we had to go back in that sense in the third quarter and do an accrual adjustment for those additional NGLs. So that's a very big positive in our NGL fraction (13:12) out of that plant is significantly higher than what we thought.","In addition, if you then match that up with the fact that we had really substantially higher offset frac shut-in wells, we had about 5,000 barrels a day shut-in if you few average for the second quarter, that increased to 10,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We're obviously very busy out in the field. We've got more rigs running, we have our own frac fleets running. We don't adjust down in terms of the quarter, and those frac leases continue to work and our shut-in production numbers move up and down every week. But suffice it to say on average much higher shut-in production in the second quarter. And that's a good thing because that means we're actively working on new wells.","The final thing I'd say in that regard is that our new wells do continue to show initial production percentages of about 80% for oil. And that's a good thing. The GORs do increase slightly through the course of the life of the wells, but suffice it to say we're still seeing IPs at 80% oil. So that is all going exceedingly well.","And I would also follow up by saying there's some discussions surrounding our oil growth. It was substantially higher in the second quarter than the third, and that has to do with a couple of factors. One is, our POP numbers were substantially higher in the second quarter, about 69 wells were put on production, where, in the third quarter, as scheduled, we have a lesser number, in this case we POPed 46 wells. By definition your oil growth rate will be a little bit less in that scenario.","And then in addition to which the same effect occurs vis-\u00e0-vis in the shutting-in of offset frac wells that has about a 5,000 barrel a day increase from the wells that are shut-in in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. But all in all, I guess the message is we are right on schedule on this forecast and I think it bodes well for our ability to keep running the factory and keep moving forward with it with even a higher level of activity.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Joey Hall, who is our EVP of Permian Operations.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to be picking up on slide number eight. Here you can see the impressive performance from our Version 2.0 completions continues. We're still trending 35% above the 1 million barrel a day equivalent type curve in the north and 25% in the southern JV area, with four more wells added in the north and one in the south.","We also continue see a positive bounce for our Version 3.0 completions when compared to 2.0 in the north, with three additional months of production data and 15 more wells. Same story with Version 3.0 completions in the south, with five additional wells added in Q3. And as we mentioned last quarter, the early results of the new POPs were masked somewhat due to choking, but we're now starting to see some good separation for our 3.0 completions.","Moving to slide number nine. Similar to the previous slide, we continue to see the improved performance from our Wolfcamp A wells in both the north and the south. In the north, Wolfcamp A Version 2.0 still showing a 25% productivity improvement with two additional wells added to the mix. Wolfcamp A Version 3.0 wells in the north are also showing a performance improvement over 2.0 with three more months of production data and eight new wells. There were no new 2.0 or 3.0 wells added in the southern JV area in Q3. And, of course, the same caveats apply on early choking at the new wells.","Moving to slide 10. Same story on lower Spraberry shale wells for our version 2.0 completions, which are still tracking 10% above the 1 million a day type curve with 10 new wells added. Just reiterating the messages from our recent well performance. 2.0 completions continue their strong performance in all intervals with no retraction on our performance that's been stated in the past. And early favorable returns on our 3.0 completions has led us to expand our optimization program from 80 to 100 wells. And we will continue to use choke management going forward to optimize the utilization of our water disposal infrastructure, so some of the early results may be somewhat held back. But long term, performance is looking very good.","Turning to slide 11. D&C costs have continued their downward trend, even though our completion sizes have increased materially with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions, which can add between $500,000 to $1.5 million to the cost of a well. For perspective, I recently compared this quarter to Q3 of 2015. And we were placing on average 25% more sand and 50% more water per well and drilling longer laterals for $145 less per foot than we were that Q3 of last year.","I'd also like to emphasize the range of well costs in the upper right corner, which shows lower Spraberry shale wells averaging $670 per foot and also highlight that we've delivered Wolfcamp A wells for an average of $5.8 million. The bigger graph of course only reflects Wolfcamp B wells, which also includes a growing population of what we refer to is as lower Wolfcamp B wells, which are typically slower drilling than the upper B targets. Bottom line, when coupled with the improved well performance, our capital efficiency continues to improve.","Moving to slide 12. This is the new slide, so I'll spend a little time explaining it. The data comes from IHS and it captures new wells with at least three months of production data between September of 2015 in June of 2016. It's important to point out that the data is not normalized for lateral length, which will be an important point here in a moment. And the Y-axis illustrates the number of new wells with at least three months of production, with the first production date after September of 2016. The X-axis is the average cumulative oil produced per well over a three-month period. So whenever you look at this, some key takeaways, no surprise, the scale of activity is significantly above that of our peers in the Midland Basin, with Pioneer putting on nearly twice as many wells as our nearest competitor.","So the next question is, at this high activity level, is there any dilution of inventory? However, in this case, you can see Pioneer is consistently delivering strong wells which highlights the quality of our acreage position. The fact that the data is not normalized further highlights the lateral length is important because it illustrates the contiguous nature of our acreage and our ability to consistently drill longer laterals. And then lastly, it demonstrates that our completion optimization efforts to continue to be successful.","Moving to slide 13. Just a few highlights here, some of which have already been covered. We are in the process of increasing to 15 rigs near term and will be at 17 rigs by year end. We remain on target to put 230 horizontal wells online with the mix of wells shown there. Version 2.0 completions remain the standard, with another 20 wells moved to Version 3.0 from the original 80. And we're now forecasting 50% to 65% IRRs with Version 2.0 and 3.0 completions and late October strip pricing.","Moving to slide 14, and my last slide. Production growth remain strong, with production up to 179,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q3. We are planning to put 60 new wells online in Q4, which will be weighted mostly late in the quarter, with production between 185,000 to 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This raises our year-end outlook in the Permian to 170,000-plus barrels of oil equivalent per day and 36% production and 38% oil growth over 2015.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rich for the financial highlights.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on slide 15, where we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $22 million or $0.13 per diluted share. It did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses of $59 million after-tax or $0.35 per share. This is due to prices at the end of September being higher than those at the end of June 30 for those derivatives that are yet to price in the future.","Also included in the quarter was an unusual item related to a deferred tax benefit that we will be recognizing a tax credit on R&D work for horizontal drilling wells, innovations that we've had from 2012 to 2015, so that was also $59 million going the other way, or $0.35. So adjusted for mark-to-market derivatives, unusual items, we were still at $22 million of income or $0.13.","Looking at the middle of the page, where you can see how we came in relative to guidance. You can see by looking down that list that we came in better than expected or within guidance on all the items listed there. So another really strong quarter for the company.","Turning to slide 16, look at price realizations. If you look at the bar charts there you can see that oil quarter on quarter was flat, with our realized prices being around $41.40 a barrel. If you look at NGLs, we were down 12%. That's mainly due to lower propane and ethane prices during the quarter. And then gas, if you look at the red bars there, it was up 46%, just due to supply and demand fundamental changes that we've seen over the last few months. If you look at the bottom part of the slide on derivatives, you can see the company continues to benefit from our strong derivative position. During the quarter, we recognized $184 million of incremental cash flow. That brings us to $533 million for the year through nine months.","Turning to slide 17, looking at production costs. You can see here by looking at the chart that we continue to trend lower. We're down 6%, as Scott mentioned, quarter-on-quarter. And it's mainly driven by our cost reduction initiatives and mainly on costs on repair costs, maintenance costs, chemical costs, those are down significantly over the time period shown here. So overall production costs continue to trend lower, they're benefiting from the new Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells that we're drilling that Scott talked about at $2 operating costs before taxes and $4 all in.","Turning to slide 18. This is the second quarter we've shown our cash margins by asset. And once again, it just highlights the cash margins that are being generated on our Permian horizontal wells, just under $30 for this quarter, 70% on oil for the reasons that Tim talked about. So really just highlights why we continue to invest over 90% of our capital budget into the Permian drilling and just given the high rate of returns these projects generate, at 50% to 65%.","Turning to slide 19, our liquidity position. Excellent liquidity position with net debt at the end of the quarter of $300 million, undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. So terrific financial position. If you look at the maturity chart there, it is worth noting that the March 2017 bond maturity has already been pre-funded. We plan to pay that with cash on hand in March of next year.","Turning to slide 20, looking at our fourth quarter outlook. Production guidance is 237,000 to 242,000 BOEs a day, really reflecting the downtime at West Pan, so that's 2,000 to 5,000 barrels per day lower than what probably normally would have been. And that obviously reflects our legacy assets that we're not investing capital in today and their decline.","Another item that is a change is production cost. You can see that it's $7.75 per BOE to $9.75 per BOE, really reflecting our lower run rate. And the rest of the items here are all consistent with our third quarter results and prior quarter guidance. I'm not going to go through those individually, but they're there for your review and modeling purposes.","So with that, Anna, I think we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. And we'll move first to Doug Leggett from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Scott, first of all, congratulations again. It's been a lot of fun. And I'm sure you'll be listening in as you go forward.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, the detail on the oil cut I think is getting a lot of attention this morning, so I appreciate you digging into that. But I wanted to ask you about the trajectory. And I'm looking at, I think it's the slide number seven. So if I look at that oil cut suggested for 2016, sorry, the 57% oil for the year. If my math is right, that would suggest Q4 needs to be up back around north of 58%. Does that sound about right? And, if so, what is changing back again to give us confidence that you're heading towards north of 60% in 2017?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think 58% does sound right is the answer to the question for the fourth quarter approximately. And the reason I think that that's really doable is because the whole reason we hit a lower percentage in Q3 was related to NGL accrual adjustment. So that is a one-time adjustment, won't reoccur. We're back to our trajectory.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And going into 2017, you're still comfortable with the north of 60% number? Or are we going to get any more of these kind of changes or adjustments?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think the number we show is what we believe from our modeling, 62%-plus potentially.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. I appreciate that. I guess my other question is really more on the 15% target. It seems pretty clear, to us anyway, that your Version 3 wells are coming in substantially above the Version 2, which is what your guidance is based on. So I guess there's a part A and a part B. The part A would be, what do you need to see to reset that type curve because of your development plan?","And secondly, would you manage towards the 15% go-forward target, or would you do more with less? Or would you expect to maintain the same level of activity and, therefore, leave the risks to the outside and (28:33) the target? How do you think about planning?","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Doug. This is Frank. I'm going to try to address that for you. If you look back at Version 2.0, I think it's fair to say we probably wanted to have, and had, six to nine months of data before we really got comfortable that we wanted to base our projections on that. And now we have.","And, in addition, now we're looking at 3.0, but we've only got three to six months, six months on our longest wells. And if you think about it, some of those wells, several of those wells, have been choke constrained. So we don't have a lot of data. So I guess we're going to want at least nine months of data before we declare victory and really go all out to do our forecasting on that basis.","But, as Joey said, our confidence level is pretty high. We've increased from 80 wells to 100 wells this year. And we're looking pretty strongly at a program next year that will certainly have a majority, maybe all of our wells will be 3.0, or most of them will be. So, again, it's a matter of getting enough data because we want to have confidence in what we're forecasting so we're giving out good numbers and realistic numbers we can achieve.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answer, guys. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to John Freeman with Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. And yeah, just echoing everybody else, Scott, congratulations and all the best in retirement.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When I look at the incremental 20 wells and the expansion of the 3.0 plan, should I assume that the mix stays relatively the same between the north, the south, the A, the B? Or is there any \u2013 those 20 incremental wells going anywhere in particular?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, it's pretty much spread out across the field, John, so you should look at it from that perspective.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then my one follow-up. Just again longer-term, obviously huge gains on the productivity side the last few years, huge gains on the cost side. Should I assume that on a longer-term basis that maybe determining the optimal well spacing becomes one of the top priorities going forward?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, John. Well spacing is certainly at the top of our list. And that is one of the biggest knobs that we can turn to impact productivity. Of course, every time we change our completion design, it may require us to tweak that a bit. But I feel like that with the number of wells we have on the ground, we're really starting to zero in on the appropriate spacing, and that's certainly a key driver.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll move next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Scott and Tim, and to the rest of your team there. Tim, if I could ask about the shut-ins for offset fracking, that's something that we've heard about I think from you guys, but also from other industry players. And I'm curious about how we should expect that trend to look going forward.","As I imagine, as you increasingly fill in your footprint with horizontals, the amount of volumes you have shut-in in any quarter for offset fracs will probably go up, but at the same time, probably the variance from quarter to quarter will go down. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And can you give us how you think about it and how you will forecast it going forward?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure, Charles. I think you're right on. To the extent we have more rigs running, more wells getting completed, this type of shut-in data in the background becomes less and less discernible. Right now, we're in a situation in the third quarter, as I mentioned, we had 10,000 barrels a day shut in. That is highly visible when you look at the numbers.","I expect, though, with our activity levels increasing, for example, in the fourth quarter, we're also estimating about 10,000 barrels a day shut in, that's in our forecast. But as you go forward, I think there'll be a percentage of shut-in wells that correspond to the activity level.","And the other way to look at it is, as you know, because we've talked about this from time to time, part of this year's campaign and certainly part of next year's drilling campaign and completion campaign will have us coming back to areas we've already drilled and completed B wells and drilling the A wells that correspond to those B wells. So what that means is, to be safe, we need to go ahead and shut in the associated B wells. So that's a natural fact as we go to an A campaign, we're shutting in B wells. It's really a mix of things. But suffice it to say, shut-in wells should be essentially linear with activity levels.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's a helpful framework, Tim. And then if I can ask a question about the charts you guys put up on these Version 3 completions. It looks very encouraging the uplift you see versus the Version 2, and I understand that there's a problem with apples to oranges comparison because of your choking management on the flow back. But I'm wondering if maybe you can add some other parameters that maybe you guys are looking at that we haven't shown in these charts, like perhaps the pressure draw down by day that may be giving you either added encouragement, but just maybe fill out the picture a little bit more on your enthusiasm for these Version 3s.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Charles. One of the things that we do any time we have a design change of this significance, and particularly with the fact that we're doing so much choking, is we're a heavy user of downhole gauges. If you don't have the downhole gauges, you're basing everything based on a calculation that has a lot of uncertainty in it. So we do put downhole gauges any time we have a change like this. And what I can tell you is that the data that we see from that is very optimistic and it helps us feel that we understand the downside of the choking and the upside of the unchoked production.","The other part of it that's been emphasized a couple of times that I think is the most important indication is the reality of adoption. What I've discovered is that typically good news stays good news over the entire life of the well. And then sometimes news that may seem uncertain works itself out over time and becomes good news. So the areas where we start to see good news on the early parts of the well, that leads us to have early adoption as opposed to wait to do something different. So, for me, the latter part tells us that the technical work has been done and we've made a decision to adopt and move forward.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful detail, Joey. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I wanted to just clarify some of your outlook comments for 2017. Scott, you talked about a 62% oil mix, 13% to 17% growth, and CapEx at $2.75 billion at the midpoint. My question is, does the $2.75 billion contemplate 17 rigs next year? And is that an all-in number including infrastructure spend?","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Arun. This is Frank. The answer is it includes running 17 rigs all year. The thing that you're probably thinking about if you have a sense that maybe that number is little high is, remember that we are drilling more wells now, maybe 15, 16 wells a year with the same number of rigs and we're completing those. Our completion costs, while overall they've been coming down, if we go to all 3.0 wells next year, that would have a tendency to skew that number up.","On infrastructure, with more activity, we'll probably be spending at least the same, if not more, on tank batteries. We do have a new target plant that we will have a 27% interest in to pay next year. But probably if you look at our other spending, this year I think we spent something like $150 million. And if you'll remember when we've talked about our forecast going forward in this model that Rich and his guys have put together, we've been spending about $300 million for vertical integration, water, those type of expenditures.","Next year I would anticipate with our water buildout, because you saw in Joey's slide, we're the league leader in number of wells that we're drilling and putting on production, we're going to need a hell of a lot of water with these bigger fracs. So we're going to extend the scope of our main line from the south into the north. We will likely start up the Midland project next year to take water from the city of Midland.","So I would not be surprised to see that other infrastructure or other capital number at least double and probably go a little bit higher than that next year. Again, those numbers are in flux. So we're giving you $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. It's kind of a preliminary number, but based on the early work we've done, that's probably within the area that we think we're going to spend.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful, Frank. My follow up is, guys, I was wondering about your thoughts on potentially taking advantage of the strong A&D market in the Permian. I know when you did the Devon transaction, you guys highlighted maybe opportunities to maybe sell some non-core acreage. I was wondering if you could highlight where you're at in terms of that process.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure. First of all, as you know, we're extremely pleased with the Devon transaction as the Sale Ranch acres that comes with that is really some of our very best acreage. And that's why that transaction was so important to us to accomplish. We do believe those types of transactions will be relatively few and far between. It's hard to find inventory out there that's as good as what we own and inventory that will then have the effect of high grading our own inventory.","That said, we think when we do a transaction like the Devon transaction, we should also carve some assets off the bottom of our portfolio. And toward that end, we have three individual efforts underway, one of which is in full gait right now, this is the sale of some acreage in Andrews County. It's about 7,000 net acres and we're right in the process of the data room work on that.","In addition, I think it will be later this year, perhaps it will extend into next year, a 20,000 acre or so package in northeast Martin County. And it's possible we'd have one smaller package in addition, so we'll see how those things go. But our whole objective here is to be able to say that a transaction like Devon is net-net, when all the smoke clears, very accretive to our portfolio.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Scott, good luck in retirement and thanks for all your help over the years. I really appreciate it.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. And again congrats, Scott. Just on type of well focus for next year. For this year, you mentioned that 60% Bs, 25% As and 15% in the Lower Spraberry. Do you anticipate similar plans next year?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I do expect kind of similar plan. The only thing I would say that you would see some skew towards is more Wolfcamp A wells. You'll start to see a larger percentage of those because of our delayed A strategy. But as far as lower Spraberry shale, it's similar. And then we'll be going into five different new areas most likely, so we'll maybe have some appraisal and we're still developing what we believe the well mix to be for those areas.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Makes sense. And then just lastly, what do you anticipate on the export cargoes for next year? It was great to see those start up. Just what type of growth we'd anticipate next year there? Thank you.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","In our case, as Scott mentioned, we have already exported two cargoes. There's one actually that's going to be exported \u2013 Pioneer will, I think it's next week. And we'll look at that time to time. It really has to do, of course, with the arbitrage opportunity presented by international crude prices, in this case, Brent, which WTI squares up against nicely in terms of quality, and WTI prices in the United States. And so over the last \u2013 actually since the export ban, which Scott was so instrumental in bringing to fruition, what's happened is you've had a situation, which you'd expect, which is where the two crudes end up differing only by their transportation differentials. And that means there's not a lot of juice in terms of exporting.","Now we have made money exporting, but it's not significant to the overall value of the barrel. However, moving it out of the United States when we're in a relatively high inventory situation I think net-net makes sense, especially if we can add margin to the value of those barrels. So you'll continue to see us looking at those opportunities as one of many opportunities for the final disposition or sales.","And that'll probably be true to the rest of the industry. The rest of the industry is up, I think our total exports have been exceeding 500,000 barrels a day, including Canada. And that can increase through time. But, again, now we're talking about an economic proposition, we're not talking about a situation where we're forcing it to happen. It'll happen to the extent that the values are there.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great details. Thanks again.","Operator","We'll now move to Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Just thinking about what you were saying about the oil market for next year. You sound very bearish on prices. Is that fair to say that we'll be expecting to see lower than $50 crude over the coming couple of years?","And, secondly, could you just remind us why you maintain such aggressive levels of activity if you are so bearish on the price? Thank you.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Paul, I think the first comment is that obviously with the large build this morning, just announced 15 minutes ago, that's putting pressure on prices. That may increase, in fact the lower goes between now and November 30, if it moves toward $40, it'll put pressure on OPEC. I'd probably raise my 40% chance up coming together because they can't afford to have another year of low $40s.","Regardless of cuts, the market balances in 2018. So I expect oil to be back up into the mid-$50s or higher in 2018. So next year is a big swing year. We're hedged. I'm not worried about it. But it could be if OPEC fails in this agreement, we could easily see another year in the low $40s in 2017.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Paul, answering your second question, I would simply submit that if you look at our actual cash costs of drilling these horizontal wells, including full boat burdens (44:29), including interest per BOE, G&A per BOE, it's about $20 per barrel. So that's why we're drilling wells when it's $50.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, that's a pretty simple answer and makes sense. And thanks for the comments on OPEC. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now move to Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. And, Scott, congratulations again.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You mentioned briefly some of the differences that you're seeing in the Upper B versus the Lower B. And I wondered if you could update us on the relative well performance and the aerial extent of examples where you've drilled an Upper B on top of a Lower B in the same unit?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So far we haven't done any Upper B on Lower B. It's merely just a matter of identifying what the best target is in any particular zone. And it varies. We particularly find that the Lower B interval is more productive in the southern JV area. And we've got some other areas in the central area that also have better productivity. So at this point in time, it's just more a matter of targeting. But we haven't done any Upper B, Lower B combinations yet.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","The only thing I'd add to that, Joey, is that as you go further south, we're talking about 800 feet of combined Upper and Lower Bs. That will afford us probably more opportunity for the stacked B drilling compared to the north, where (45:54) thinning out to maybe 400 feet. So part of it will be just that simple amount of thickness which will dictate where we'll drill those stacked wells when the time comes.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And is that in the plan for 2017, to drill stacked wells? Or is that longer term?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's being discussed. Haven't decided yet.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then on operating costs, your slide 18 continues to have a helpful breakout of the operating cost by region. Can you just discuss your expectations over 2017 and maybe 2018, as on one end the horizontals that are online decline, but then you're accelerating the amount of horizontal POPs? And then any industry inflation or other inflation you may see?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think the way I would consider that, Brian, is that as we continue to increase activity levels, by definition we keep a ceiling on this production cost number, that is to the extent other older wells are declining, their operating cost per BOE goes up by definition. We match that up with more new wells with higher volumes that tend to supersede those declines. So I think you'll reach some sort of asymptote here before too long where that's going to be the case, and it's probably in the low 2s.","As it relates to inflation, production cost is probably the one area where we have risks of inflation, because the majority of production costs are things like personnel, chemicals, power, all of which are very difficult for us to hedge in any significant way. So if we have any risk of inflation, that's probably where it is. Now I think if you look at the state of Texas, power costs are extremely low, we benefit from wind power here substantially because of that. We've got great chemical contracts. I think the labor workforce will probably be needing some bumps in compensation just to get more workers back in the Basin. But I think we can control a lot of that. And I don't really see any substantial risk of any really serious blowout when it comes to inflation hurting our production cost.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Pearce Hammond from Piper Jaffray.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. And, Scott, all the best to you and Kim in your retirement. My first question, you have a helpful slide on page 11 of your deck that shows drilling and completion costs per perforated lateral foot, and it's obviously come down over time. It looks like that rate of descent, though, has slowed Q2 to Q3. And so I guess in the big picture, Tim, do you think that we could actually start to see this number go up with either service cost inflation or just more of the Version 3 completions working their way through the system?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think to the extent that we have, as Frank had mentioned, a substantial number of wells in our 2017 campaign that are Version 3.0, and I think that's the way we're leaning today. Then that has to be offset by further productivity gains and\/or cost savings.","I think that one thing we'll benefit from is we have several rigs that we're now bringing out of stack. We'll have essentially no stacked rig costs for most of 2017. And several of those rigs, at least half of those rigs, come off of existing contracts that were, at the time of their signing, at something like $26,000 a day. We will re-sign those at whatever the then-current market is. Today it's maybe $14,000 or so. So we can see a savings that comes from that. I think we'll continue to nickel and dime away at these costs.","But you're right, to the extent we mix in more 3.0s, we could see the number bottoming out. As to the inflation effects here, here I think we're very well protected. We can argue all day long about when service companies are going to have pricing power. But the fact is, we're doing our own completions. We have five fleets running today. We know what the costs of those are, so we're not going to be subject to cost increases on completions, which is, as you know, by far the biggest cost of the wells. And in fact, we may have reductions in drilling costs, as I mentioned.","So I think overall, we are well protected and from any inflationary issues when it comes to our capital program. And I think that'll continue through 2017. And for my money, I don't think the service companies will have a lot of pricing power until we get well into 2018, and that's predicated on higher prices.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Excellent. Thanks for that answer, Tim. And then follow-up, just housekeeping to make sure I understand this right, so on this preliminary 2017 CapEx between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion, what's the price deck you're assuming for that?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's going to be basically a $50 to $55 associated with strip.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's a strip.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. And I'd like to echo the compliments to Scott, and not only for the great job you did building Pioneer, but also the wonderful job he's done in grooming management to carry on after his retirement.","Scott Douglas Sheffield - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","My first question is, when do the Version 3 wells go off of choke management?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Typically, two to three weeks or four weeks into their life.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. Bearing in mind that they outperformed, so I'm just wondering if you didn't have the water management issue, do think you would choke the Version 3 wells anyway? Perhaps it's having a positive influence on (51:25).","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","We don't really right now believe that there's any long-term impact, positive or negative of choking the wells back. It is simply a surface equipment utilization issue we're dealing with. And so I think if it were not for that, if we had infinite amount of capacity for water handling, all these wells would be on full production.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Last question I'd like to ask real quick. I'm going back to slide 18. It shows that Pioneer's assets other than the Permian and the Eagle Ford are fairly low margin, primarily because they are so gassy, as is illustrated on slide 22. So I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on simplifying the portfolio over time, maybe raising some cash for more higher margin drilling by selling these assets.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think we look at our company and say everything in the company is for sale every day. So we kind of look at things that way. I think it's certainly the case that some of these assets are areas where we're not utilizing much capital. But by the same token, they would stand to benefit significantly with increases in commodity prices.","As you stated, if we see any bump in gas, the Eagle Ford economics improve considerably. It's certainly true of our Midcontinent assets as well. In fact, we're taking a look at a drilling campaign for Eagle Ford next year with that in mind with our partner. So suffice it to say everything we look at is for sale, but we right now aren't contemplating any particular sale of the types you're talking about.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","We'll move next to Matt Portillo from TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just a quick clarification on the 2017 CapEx. Just wanted to make sure I understood. So from a capital perspective, is it fair to assume that you're baking in the Version 3 fracs for the wells that you're drilling next year? And then commensurate with that, you have not yet baked in the Version 3 fracs for your production guidance?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's right.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Everything from 2017 is still 2.0-based.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Right.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","On the production side. But for the capital side, you have baked in the Version 3 fracs?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, we haven't. I just mentioned that that could be an increase above what we already have if it turns out that we decided to go with, say, the majority 3.0s.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. And then just a second question, a follow-up to the previous question on the Eagle Ford. Could you frame any context or color around how you think about adding back activity to the play and maybe what some of the drivers might be behind that, if and when you do consider it?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Certainly I think, as I mentioned a minute ago, Matt, commodity prices are a big player here. And in this particular case where we operate in the play, the price of natural gas and NGLs become critical to the play, and particularly on the NGL front, ethane prices because about 40% of what we produce in NGLs in Eagle Ford are ethane.","We have seen some cooperation with gas prices, now some of that is peeled back. Ethane prices have done essentially the same thing. I think ethane has some potential for improvement as we get into 2017 and 2018. So the economics certainly has room to improve from here before we make those decisions, but that will certainly be the number one factor.","Of course, in association with our obligations to Enterprise and our throughput agreements in the Eagle Ford, we have minimum daily requirements for efficiency fees if (54:53) we don't meet those. And we can offset some of those by drilling, which would be a positive as well.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll move next to James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the call. And congratulations, Scott, on the retirement. I just wanted to come back to something most of you guys have asked and answered most of the questions already, but in the discussion about offset fracs, you guys talked about coming in with your layering in the Wolfcamp As over the existing Bs. And could you just remind us what information you guys have, if any, about communication between laterals when you do that, and whether that information, if you do have it, is based off of older completion designs which were used less so than your wellbore fracturing? And just any update you guys might have on that.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, we have quite a bit of data on communication. And of course, as you go across the field, as the frac barrier varies, the communication varies as well. But generally speaking, whenever we do stimulate an A well, we are going to shut in the B wells. And we're going to shut them in until the A well is drilled out and then bring them back online continuously.","We've done quite a bit of interference testing over the last couple of years to understand the communication between the two. It's not similar across the entire field. It varies, again, based on the frac barrier strength. But I do believe we have a really good feeling for the way that those wells do communicate. But we certainly don't want to deteriorate the quality of an A well by not shutting in that B well. So we feel strongly enough to where we're going to do that consistently.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. And do you have any evidence of a synergistic frac when you bring that B back on? Does it come in at a higher rate? Or is there any evidence of that in places where the frac barrier is?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Similar to the Eagle Ford, the initial come-back is sometimes better, sometimes worse. But what we see over time is that they come back to what we expect.","James Sullivan - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal Shah","Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim will be up first. He will discuss our solid 2018 results and our strong 2019 outlook, including many of the factors that differentiate Pioneer from our peers. After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey, will review our strong horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin, specifically our best-in-class oil production and our strong operational results. Further, Joey will discuss our commitment to environmental social and governance principles. Rich will then update you on our firm transportation commitments to move oil from Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we are receiving. Tim will then return with a brief recap and commentary. After that, we will open up the call for your questions. Thank you.","So with that I'll turn it over to Tim.","Tim Dove","Thank you, Neal, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to have a chance to talk about our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook. 2018 was a very strong year for the company and we look forward to an even better year that's more capital efficient in 2019 as we focus 100% of our efforts on our large Permian development plan.","If you take a look at slide 2, we delivered an ROCE for the year of about 9%. That's significantly up from the 4% level that we had in 2017. That's clearly a sign of high-return wells high-return margins that eventually hit the bottom line. Actually we would have been in double digits had we not liquidated hedges in the fourth quarter, which went directly to the P&L.","Our firm transportation contracts delivered fantastically in 2018, actually realized increased cash flow by almost $0.5 billion for the year $458 million cash flow uplift, which is a phenomenal benefit coming from the long-term taking. And the key being our ability to deliver on FT oil volumes to the Gulf Coast and for export and particularly that -- all that oil is priced on Brent-related basis.","Cash flow is up about 88% this year in 2018. We took some very important steps in the fourth quarter in particular divesting noncore assets that were not in the Permian Basin, of course, and our Pioneer Pumping Services.","As all of you have already been advised, we're also in the process of de-commissioning our Brady sand mine that will be completed very shortly here in the first quarter. And we continue to work on the Eagle Ford asset sale.","Our return of capital to shareholders continues to expand as part of our main goals, as we repurchased about $328 million of our $2 billion authorization that we put in place in December as over the last two months, and at attractive prices I might add. Again, yesterday we doubled our dividend. That amounts now to about a 700% increase over the last two years, an eightfold increase.","Finally, the steps we took in 2018 will be really important when it comes to 2019 in the sense that we in our 2019 plan can point to a significant CapEx decrease about 11% compared to 2018, while at the same time delivering a strong 15% increase in production. So, we're very excited about what 2019 holds when we can show that kind of capital efficiency gains.","Let's turn now to slide three. I think it's important to build on our success in 2018 and therefore, look forward to an even better 2019 with the capital efficiency improvement that I mentioned.","We had quite a good fourth quarter. Oil production for the Permian was toward the top end of the guidance range, as shown about 194,000 BOPD per day. And Permian BOE production was at the top end of the guidance. Of that almost $0.5 billion of FT, $173 million was achieved in the first quarter, sorry, the fourth quarter.","And then in addition to which we showed in the fourth quarter again reductions in Permian lease operating expenses. Very important, of course in today's world where with the commodities ended up in the fourth quarter to have a heavy focus on LOE reduction and we did just that.","As already mentioned, our cash flow was up significantly in 2018 versus 2017. And a significant amount of that was in the fourth quarter about 38% versus 2017. Again, we still retain one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And our debt metrics are shown there, very strong debt metrics at year-end.","Turning to slide four. This refers to our low cost of supply and really is based on our high margin wells that we can generate very strong returns through the cycle. So, those cycles allow us continue operating. And with 98% of our barrels or so receiving Brent-related pricing, it will further expand our margins and increase our cash flow. ","You can see on this chart, as we look at actuals for 2018 and build from proved developed F&D, adding production cost and taxes, G&A and interest expense that our full about cost structure for horizontal drilling and putting these wells on production is $23 per barrel. That's why we can achieve higher rates of return even if we're in the low $50s on WTI.","And certainly the Brent-related pricing has helped, but it's also the case that this large resource base we have here, in the Permian Basin, is probably the lowest cost breakeven basin in the industry. And therefore, it bodes well for a successful future for the company.","Turning now to slide five. I've already mentioned that 2019 is going to be a strong capital efficiency year. We're again showing a material reduction in CapEx to about 11%, while achieving the mid-point of the range about 15% production growth compared to last year.","Activity will be slightly higher this year about 265 to 290 POPs. We're going to be averaging about 21 to 23 rigs. And despite all of that, we'll be reducing our capital about $350 million which also points to our capital efficiency.","You can see on Slide 5 that our well mix still is skewed pretty heavily towards Wolfcamp A and B. Spraberry, of course, increasing some additional tests in the Wolfcamp D.","Cash currently based on the $53 WTI case or a $60 Brent case is approximately $3.2 billion. When you compare that to our 2019 drilling and completions and facilities CapEx, the cash flow is easily enough to pay for that effort that budget of D, C, and F in addition to which our cash flow is very sensitive to oil price changes. With a $5 change in oil prices, we generate about $400 million of additional cash flow.","Turning then to Slide 6, improving capital efficiency is one of the main messages for today. And when it comes to 2019, the 11% capital reduction and then a 15% growth rate indicates such capital efficiency. The drivers are really related to some of the initiatives we achieved at the end of last year when we announced the divestiture of PPS to ProPetro.","That was completed on December 31st, so it becomes effective January 1st. And, of course, we are in the midst of transforming all of our sand supply to West Texas sand and that will be done -- essentially completed in the early part of the second quarter. And at that point in time we can show very significant cost benefits.","It's really important to point out that these are not sort of pie in the sky or wish list cost benefits. These are all based on contractual arrangements that is whether it's sand or whether it's our arrangements with ProPetro those are all under contract. And so these are readily achievable I feel like based on that.","For example our pressure pumping cost savings could be as much as in the neighborhood of $650,000 per well. It's simply because ProPetro runs an excellent operation. They're great company with a tremendous market share and that gives them efficiencies from the standpoint of their fixed costs and being able to spread that over more fleets.","They run a smaller organization at the top level than we had done and they run it very efficiently and lean. And so I think when you look at the effort that we put in place to arrange this contract with ProPetro it's going to be beneficial to both companies. In addition to which it saves us from CapEx that otherwise have to go into the fleets when we own them.","A sand is similar in the sense that it gets a big impact on the cost structure probably $350,000 to $400,000 per well. And this is going all to 100 mesh well, of course. But the 100 mesh sand also has another benefit and that is we can simplify our completion designs.","And what that means is we can reduce the amount of gel we've been using on heavier sands if you will and also the amount of surfactant need which will reduce cost by well by another $200,000. So, again, it's a product more of the sand change out on these wells than anything else.","In addition we're starting to see the benefits of our water infrastructure. And also we've been coming out of 2018 very high efficiencies on drilling and completions which when averaged over the whole year continue to benefit us in all of 2019.","We do see the potential for some inflation during the year. I think we'll be second half weighted as the opportunities for people to ramp up in connection with new pipeline space coming on stream could lead to increased activity and therefore might be a period of inflation. But I would call it minimal at this point. We're baking in about a 2% inflation rate in terms of mostly focused on the second half of the year.","So, the combination of all these will really drive an increasingly efficient program here. And with that robust production growth and material decrease in capital spending, I think, it bodes well for a strong year of capital efficiency.","And turning to slide 7, I want to talk a little bit about the five pillars or the five principles that we're utilizing here to focus on enhancing shareholder value. The first of course is focusing on returns. I've already mentioned this that our ROCE numbers are improving and that's because the returns on these wells are very strong as we continue to increase EUR per well. Joey will talk more about that in the subsequent slide, and we drive the cost down the wells.","One of the things we are trying to achieve, of course, is moving the capital to where we're generating free cash flow, and at the same time growing considerably and that's the focus on capital discipline.","The steps we've taken recently that is in December as well as yesterday vis-\u00e0-vis, the dividend increase show a focus on return of capital to shareholders. One major aspect of our company is the fact that we have a very strong balance sheet, perhaps the strongest in all the energy patch and it gives us a lot of financial flexibility going forward.","One of our tremendous benefits, of course, is our inventory, inventory of low-risk wells, high-return wells that give us a runway or a pathway to long-term organic growth. And what I want to do is address each of these five in some subsequent slides. We'll use some more details on actually how we're going to accomplish that in the next few slides.","So first let's focus on that idea of the focus on returns on slide 8. And what you can see on slide 8 is that there's a couple of benefits we have here. Number one, when you look at ROCE, you can see that Pioneer is above the peer average in terms of ROCE for 2018. And one of the reasons that's the case is, because we're generating corporate returns that are high due to the fact we have low-cost acreage in our assets, low-cost acreage being that which -- that was really put together in the 1990s effectively. We've done very few acquisitions.","If you look at the graph on the right, you can see many of our peers have engaged in very expensive acquisitions, some of them up to almost $90,000 an acre. Our average bases on the balance sheet for our acreage is $500 an acre. So what you can see at the bottom is that if you're going to amortize that across well locations, the cost that we amortize to a well for unproved acreage is $21,000 a well.","If you look at the most expensive of the acquisitions shown here, the 15th acquisition on the right, you're going to be amortizing again $3.7 million per location. And so it's going to give us a tremendous advantage going forward. The fact that unlike our peers, we've been able to use our low-cost bases as an advantage. That's going to continue to give us a return advantage at the corporate level. And in addition to which that low-cost basis can support many years of growth generating higher returns.","Going to slide 9 and now focusing on capital discipline as the second topic. This chart is similar to the waterfall chart, you see some other companies utilizing it sort of like this. But on the left you see that our cash flow at about $40, if it were to be that price on a WTI basis would be that which would be sufficient to cover our maintenance CapEx about $2.2 billion.","When you look at a $53 case, which is essentially what this whole presentation is based on, you can see it allows us to do two things. One is to increase our dividend, which we've shown and we've done as of yesterday; and also generate growth, the growth in production ranges that we're talking about for 2019.","It does give us other opportunities of course to the extent that we have prices well above that $53 case. We've got a lot of different options, whether it's share repurchases or other investments just building the balance sheet additional growth or what have you. The answer is, we have a lot of financial flexibility and a lot of operating flexibility. We actually get a case above $53 oil.","Slide 10 then is the next of those five topics. This one's focused on a return of capital. As I've already mentioned, we've had a substantial increase in the return of capital to shareholders. It's a main mantra of ours. Our dividend is eight times what it was in the first quarter of 2017. And we repurchased also as I said over $300 million of the $2 billion authorization. So far this year and combined with the -- this combining the dividends and also the share buybacks, we've generated a return to shareholders of 1.9%, roughly about 2% in 2019.","And turning to Slide 11. This is a balance sheet-related slide. You can see where the company sits in terms of its relative measures of debt, in this case debt-to-EBITDA on the vertical axis and debt-to-market cap. You can see under any measure basically even among the largest companies in the industry we are -- have the strongest balance sheets basically in the industry. Net debt at year-end of just under $1 billion reflecting a substantial amount of cash and investments on hand $1.4 billion. And then of course that gives us lots of financial flexibility going forward as it relates to the next set of decisions to be made.","Now another slide, slide 12 talks about the repeatability of our program. We really have what amounts to as an unmatched footprint, unmatched in terms of scale, in terms of continuity. And the fact is our wells have improved year over year over year and they continue to do so. You can see that on the graph on the top right. 2018, you still see, this is where all the wells drilled.","Again increases in terms of productivity which is phenomenal that we're able to do this many years and we've been able to do that. Of course it has to do with the fact that we have a tremendous data set. Of course we had drilled 5000 to 7000 vertical wells over the years and plus we've now drilled some 1200 or 1300 horizontal wells. We have the largest data set of any company and that allows us with that proprietary data set to do all kinds of evaluations and appraisals. That's the best way to develop these wells and to complete the wells including using machine learning.","So it's a methodical approach to appraisal. That's really been the keys to that. And it's allowed us to year after year increase the resource available to us. So when you match that up with capital efficiency and you realize we're actually increasing EURs per well that's a formula for a significant improvement going forward. And again, we have acreage to do so. It's very contiguous and as a result gives you a lot of cost efficiencies related to that.","What I'm going to do now is pass it over to Joey and he's going to give you a bit of an update on operational performance and also an update on some of the recent well results.","J.D. Hall","Thanks Tim and good morning everybody. I'm going to be starting out on Slide 13 where we want to deliver two main message, both of which speak to our ability to sustainably deliver strong margins. On the left-hand side, you can see that on a gross production basis Pioneer has the highest oil percentage in the Permian Basin. And this is of course the foundation to our ability to deliver in our strong margins.","And then on the right-hand side and of equal importance, you can see that since 2016 Pioneer is the leader in cumulative oil production in the Permian. Again these two facts combine and speak to our ability to consistently deliver robust margins and generate strong returns.","Now I'm going to be turning to Slide 14. Last quarter, we updated you on our first Stackberry test in Western Martin County. Very similar and encouraging results from our second Stackberry test in Central Midland County. Here we had eight wells drilled and completed as one project.","Wells on this pad are outperforming previously drilled Spraberry wells in that same area by about 34%. Of course this speaks to our advancements and our completion strategies. But I believe more importantly, it speaks to our ability to deliver strong well performance in full development mode.","These results also drive our strategy to implement more large-scale projects in 2019. We have our third Stackberry test online in Martin County and it is on production and cleaning up. And we'll be reporting on that in the Q1 call.","We've also continued our success in the Wolfcamp D, we POP\u2019d another Wolfcamp D 2-well pad in the Western Glasscock County. These wells have only been online for a few weeks but showing very strong early time performance with average 24-hour IP on these two wells over 4000 BOEs per day with a 72% oil mix. And of course we will be continuing our Wolfcamp D appraisal work in 2019.","Now shifting to slide 15. Here we want to highlight our commitment to thoughtful planning and sustainable practices. In 2019 you see that approximately 40% of our pads will be four wells or larger compared to only 10% in 2018. These larger pads of course will help us reduce unit cost due to the resulting Drilling and Completion efficiency gains.","We also continue to leverage and evolve our automated water infrastructure and we remain committed to reduce our usage of freshwater. At the end of 2018, we were using about 10% to 15% of our completion needs for being supplied through recycled water. And we're going to stay on that journey in 2019 and plan by the end of the year that about 30% of our needs will be supplied through recycling.","Combine this with our current and future effluent water sources from the cities of Odessa and Midland and this positions us to significantly reduce our use of freshwater while decreasing our cost of supply. All these things combined with our other centralized facilities allow us to drive down overall development capital.","Now I'll be moving to slide 16, really just a very simple but important message here. Pioneer is absolutely committed to safe, responsible and sustainable operations. As you could see from the previous slide, the great news is, is that sustainable practices go hand-in-hand with running efficient operations.","And we just want to highlight that for great insight into some of these practices and the proactive measures that we're taking here at Pioneer to operate responsibly we'll just direct you to and take the opportunity to read our 2018 sustainability report where we outlined some of these practices.","And so with that I'm going to pass it off to Rich.","Rich Dealy","Thanks Joey and good morning. I'm going to cover slide 17 where you can see that one of the benefits of long-term planning has been entering into firm transportation arrangements to move our oil to the Gulf Coast.","The ability to sell this oil at Brent-related pricing has had a very positive impact on both margins and returns in 2018. For instance during the fourth quarter, we moved about 90% of our oil to the Gulf Coast which had the effect of increasing our oil margins by over $9 per barrel.","For the year our per barrel margin was improved by over $6 as you can see on the upper left corner of the slide where our realized price was $64, including the benefit of Brent-related pricing versus the Midland market price of about $58 per barrel. If you put this on a cash flow perspective, these sales added an incremental $173 million in the fourth quarter or $458 million for the year.","During the fourth quarter we transported about 175,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast about -- of which about 80% of those barrels were exported internationally with 60% of those barrels going to Europe and 40% to Asia.","Our transport volumes do increase starting January 1 to 200,000 barrels a day. And based on forecasted price differentials between Midland pricing and Brent pricing, we are forecasting a first quarter uplift of approximately $40 million to $100 million for the quarter or $2 to $5 per barrel. Once again, you can see that the firm transportation is allowing us really to get Brent-related pricing on most of our oil production and most importantly, improving margins and returns.","So with that, I'm going to kick it back to Tim for a few closing comments.","Tim Dove","Thanks, Rich, and I appreciate everybody being on the call. We're going to turn to Q&A in just a minute. But, again, I want to focus everyone on the fact that there are really five pillars or five key aspect of what we're going to do to drive results here and drive performance. And they are, again, our focus on returns and we are heavily focused on this.","And I think we have a tremendous advantage with that low-cost basis acreage that I referred to earlier, as well as the fact that we've got very high-return wells. And we want to push the company towards a free cash flow-generative model, of course, and at the same time be growing. I think those are a good model, when coupled together.","Return on capital to shareholders we're showing to the market that that's important to us, as we continue to increase that. And I think that would be the plan going forward as well. We already have one of the best balance sheets in the industry and plan to keep it that way, with low leverage, because you never know what's going to happen with commodity prices. We certainly want to be responsive and have the right balance sheet to be able to deal with any outcome and I think that's the position we're in today.","And finally, we can continue to repeat this. We have quite a large inventory of wells to drill over the next many years. And basically what's going to happen, this growth is going to occur without acquisitions. And we don't really need to do large acquisitions like some of our peers to grow. And that then preserves our low-cost basis in the acreage. And it's essentially organic growth from the drill bit.","And I think that's the best way to proceed there from the standpoint of returns and all of these goals. So as you can tell from our presentation, we're very excited about 2019. And it's going to be a year in which we substantially gain in capital efficiency, which is something we're very heavily focused on.","So Anna, I'm going to stop there and we're going to kick it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take a question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Tim, can I congratulate the IR team on a tremendous update to the presentation deck. I love the new format.","Tim Dove","Yes. The new PXD look, Doug, okay? So it's all good.","Doug Leggate","All right. So with that, I've got two questions if I may. Tim, first of all philosophically and we obviously believe your share price is tremendously undervalued. But while you were talking, I was just looking at the chart. Your share price today is pretty much where it was in March 2016. Your production has doubled in that time frame. Your net debt is flat and the oil price is actually higher than it was back then.","My point is, the market clearly isn't paying for your business model. And I'm just curious, with the share buyback announcement, you're still looking at pretty punchy growth, not a lot of free organic cash flow. Have you considered, and if not why, the right model might be to slow down the growth and really have a hard look at buying back shares more aggressively, given that the market seems to pay for growth per debt adjusted share as opposed to absolute growth in marathon today, but the case in point, looking at their share price reaction?","Tim Dove","Well, I think, Doug, first of all, we are slowing down growth, if you look at this year compared to the prior two years, we've been well into the 20s in terms of growth percentages. We have moved this down. We have a range now which centers on 15%. Obviously, we can ratchet within that range at a moment's notice. It's based on how much activity we want to execute on. But fundamentally, we've taken significant steps to increase basically return of capital to shareholders and we wouldn't have a $2 billion share repurchase plan if that wasn't the case. But I think we have to go further. ","I mean, I think, if you look at our dividends announcements yesterday, we still have a dividend which I believe will be subject to further increases in the future, as we evaluate our business model and go forward. We have some room before we get up to even what I will be considering that which would be near some of our peers that we respect. So, I think the answer is there's room to move forward along those lines.","Doug Leggate","Okay. I guess just as a point of clarification. The buyback program, if I look at the strength of your balance sheet, I guess this one is for Rich probably, but when you think about the right level of debt-to-EBITDA coverage and given where your share price is, should we expect you to exploit the balance sheet a little more to take advantage of share price weakness or is that not the way to think about it? In other words, not out of free cash flow, but buying back shares out of your balance sheet essentially.","Rich Dealy","Yeah. When, I think when we approved the share repurchase program, it was predicated on knowing where our balance sheet was at that point in time. I mean, obviously, we're going to manage the company to low leverage like we've done in the past, given the volatile industry we live in. And we're just going to keep those debt metrics in that less than one-time debt-to-EBITDA type levels. But we have clearly a great balance sheet today that allows us to take advantage of the valuation of our stock when we think it's appropriate to buyback aggressively if need be.","Doug Leggate","Okay.","Tim Dove","Yeah, I would only add that, if you look at what is the ultimate model, it's to actually generate excess cash such that we can actually decide regarding dividend increases or share repurchases from that incremental cash above our capital needs. We're on a track to that exact outcome.","Rich Dealy","And it\u2019s definitely a long-term goal.","Doug Leggate","I don\u2019t want to hold all the questions, guys. I\u2019ll let someone else to jump on. Thanks. I know it\u2019s not an easy question to answer Tim, so thanks for taking it. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah, good morning. Tim, the focus today I think has been where the puck has been in terms of higher D&C cost in 2018. Your outlook suggests where the puck is going is towards much lower D&C cost. Just wondering what kind of confidence do you have, can you give investors this morning that you can meet this $3.1 billion to $3.4 million kind of CapEx number given what happened in 2018?","Tim Dove","Yeah, first, let me comment on 2018, because I know we did come in a little bit high on capital. And so, the primary, one of the primary reasons for that was the fact we were so efficient. I mean, this is a strange conundrum, but we were very efficient in terms of our drilling and completions efficiencies, which means we got more POPs done and that's a good thing. I mean, that said as our capital run rate increases as a result of that. And we also had some other land-related expenses and gas prices expenses that hit in the fourth quarter from what is going to be construction projects to end the year and the first half of the year.","And so, when you look at that, those are things that we have essentially behind us from the standpoint of the current run rates. What I would simply say about 2019, all the stuff is basically contractual. We have contracted the sand. We have contracted the pressure pumping. We have specific price books in every case. We also then as a result of using the finer sand then have cost savings because as I mentioned earlier regarding gel and surfactant and so on. And as a result, when you consider other efficiencies that we're bringing to bear as well and we have those efficiencies occur throughout the entire year that ended last year, we can point to various specific reductions. And so this is not as I said a pie-in-the-sky cost reduction plan. This is contractual and I guess the main point.","Arun Jayaram","Great. Just a follow-up on the 2019 program. 265 to 290 POPs, wondering if you could provide some details on kind of the mix between North and South and the different intervals. And just a little follow-up here. As you switch to the 100 mesh sand versus gel, Tim, is there any changes that you perceive in terms of well productivity given the lower cost to a more simplified completion design?","Tim Dove","Yes. On the last question I think what we've seen is that the lower -- the finer mesh sands actually has produced very strong results. There were no difference in results. And as a result, there's no reason not to take advantage of the cost savings. Now, we're continually watching over that, but I believe we already essentially proved after -- now like I said multiple quarters we've been watching not only our data, but pure data. On your question on the rigs, well, I can kind of look at more rigs. We'll be probably in the neighborhood of five rigs in the South and the balance will be in the North, but you can translate that to POPs.","Operator","Do you have anything further?","Arun Jayaram","No.","Operator","Okay, great. Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bob Morris with Citi.","Bob Morris","Thank you. Tim, nice to see the initiatives on the well cost reductions here. As you look out to 2019, are there any further initiatives in the works to further reduce the well cost here going forward or it will be pretty much all achieved?","Tim Dove","Every day \u2013 Joey, you might want to comment. Every day we're trying to reduce the well cost Bob. And these are some major chunks we've taken out of the year. But there's other things. Joey, why don't you comment on some of the other initiatives?","J.D. Hall","Yes, Bob. This is a focus every day. We're not just taking advantage of the contractual realities that are going to significantly make an impact. But I was actually reflecting on some numbers this morning. When you look from 2017 through 2018 and we reduced our cycle times by almost 20% on the drilling side and 10% on the completion side of course those are -- it doesn't necessarily translate 20% faster, doesn't necessarily mean 20% less, but it does mean less. We're continuing in that momentum going into 2019. All those things are -- we're making these improvements by design, by focusing on NPT and eliminating waste from our supply chain and everything that we can do to get the most effective and most capital-efficient operation that we can. So absolutely, that's where the hard work is making the contracts be different. That's in the rearview mirror and now we've got to continue to work hard to drive down other cost. And we've got lots of things in the works to do that.","Bob Morris","That's great. And congrats on the initiatives you've accomplished here. The second question is just on the source of the 2% cost inflation you expect this year, a lot of your Permian peers are pointing to a 5% to 10% cost deflation this year. So just curious a little bit about what gives the source of the 2% cost inflation that you mentioned was more in the second half of the year, but where that comes into play?","Tim Dove","Yes. Bob, I think we're really referring to because we're talking about average numbers for 2019 is the average is 2% for the year. You could easily have 4% or 5% by the time the end of the year is here. That means, you'd be averaging about 2% and I think it's largely driven by labor cost. And as I mentioned in the commentary earlier, it very well could be because of the heightened activity. You see the DUC count numbers just like I do and you realize that once the pipeline of space is unleashed, there should be an increase in activity and that could lead to some inflation.","We certainly haven't seen much yet this year. In fact, we've seen some reductions in certain of our costs including our rigs. This is another point that Joey didn't make, but our rig costs are lower just because they're tied to oil prices than they have been last year. And so I think being conservative here is definitely a positive. I mean I feel like it and that's kind of what we're trying to achieve. But I think 2% made on average maybe a reasonable expectation. It doesn't really disagree with what others are saying.","Bob Morris","Okay, great. Thank you and nice quarter.","Tim Dove","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning Tim, you and your team there.","Tim Dove","Hi Charles.","Charles Meade","You've touched on this just briefly Tim in response to an earlier question but I wanted to go back to this new completion design. You guys put a lot of detail in here about the savings you're going to get on the capital side. But you also mentioned that you're not seeing any change on the well productivity side.","Can you talk about what you thought you might see what you've seen to date and if we on the outside looking in should expect -- or what if anything we should expect different over the course of 2019 as these wells come online and produce?","Tim Dove","Yes. I think, first of all, when you're talking about the completion design, what's changed, of course, this year, in particular, this should be the first year that 100% of our completions are just sort of dialed into specific types by zone by area.","In other words there's not just everything 3.0-plus or everything is 3.0. It's -- there's a whole mixture of different completion techniques. So -- and that's what you hope actually leads to incremental improvement of the EURs just like we've seen in the last four years.","And so I hope we can show in other lines it exceeds the 2018 performance line by doing just that. And again it's a product to a great extent of our machine learning efforts to understand exactly what's the right formula to make these completions more efficient.","So, I think we're not really bucketing the completions in any specific versions, but rather we're just trying to optimize across the whole program.","J.D. Hall","And Charles I would just add one thing as an example. Whenever we talk about the contractual savings that we'd get from shifting to 100 mesh West Texas sand, there is a cause and effect relationship that goes on in that decision and there are similar ones.","And the sand that we're using previously is a coarser sand. And coarser sand requires higher viscosity fluids in order to deliver it. And with the lower mesh sand we're able to reduce the amount of gel that we use which is substantial savings in cost. And we're able to deliver the same amount of sand for less cost. So that's an example of how some of these contractual changes also have a technical change but has no impact on well performance.","Charles Meade","Right. And I guess that's really the key. There's no impact to the well performance from this change of the grain size.","J.D. Hall","Correct.","Tim Dove","That's across our data and also our peers.","Charles Meade","Got it, got it. Thank you, Tim, that's -- Joey, that's what I was after there. And then the second thing if I could ask about this Stackberry -- Stackberry test and how it kind of interacts with your move to more big pads in 2019. It looks to me like this big well Stackberry test is one of the bigger pads that you guys have used or are using.","So, is that something that's specific to this -- to the need to co-develop those three zones? Or is this more something we should look for that you can use in your Wolfcamp A and B program, where there's efficiencies just from having the rig and completion crew on location longer?","J.D. Hall","Yes Charles. The answer to your question is that, does not only applies to the Stackberry development, but we're also going to be doing several A and B co-developments. And even in the future, towards the end of 2019 we have some Stackberry combined with A, B and D co-developments.","I think it's really important to point out that we do that for two reasons; one, for the operational efficiencies that you mentioned. But also we believe that's the most optimal way to develop these wells and avoid the parent-child impacts that you hear a lot of the operators talking about.","So for us it's a win-win. The only downside is these larger pads do have longer cycle times. But the upside from an EUR perspective and from a cost efficiency perspective far outweigh the cycle times that you endure.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thanks for the added detail.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. My question is a follow-up on the topic of initiating and executing on the CapEx plan. First to start, I think Tim you mentioned that the construction spending that partly impacted fourth quarter CapEx is continuing into the first quarter or the first half. So just to set expectations on the budget that you've said what percent do you expect to be spent in Q1 just to make sure there's no surprises on the trajectory?","Tim Dove","Yes. So I think first of all as we know as we try we're going to get the sand savings until into the early part of the second quarter. So that's an example of things we're going to have a run rate that's higher, and at the same time we've got certain costs to hit the first quarter including Targa-related cost. So Neal you want to give more detail and answer that?","Neal Shah","Yes. Brian as we were looking at our rig ramp and other rig trajectory moves throughout the year, the exit rate on that rig count extends really through that first quarter until we really start dropping rigs and we kind of normalize where that average day on the full year. So that too also drives 1Q spending versus the fullness of 2019 to be somewhat higher.","Brian Singer","Got it. Is there any greater clarity on the percentage you could give again just to make it a little bit more clear?","Neal Shah","Yes. Your run rate for 1Q is going to be -- it's definitely going to be higher than your Q2, Q3 or Q4 run rate. So - and obviously here like we're talking about the rigs. We've got an additional rig -- few rigs running in based on the exit ramp rate. And then you've got the additional spending related to Targa as well.","But we can definitely help you with your modeling as well offline. But you can think about the cost for -- to running additional rigs coming out of the year versus the rig decrease throughout the second and third quarters somewhere around -- you could think about somewhere around the $150 million $200 million.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. And then my follow-up is a little bit bigger picture but with regard to the same CapEx topic. The mindset of the company seems to be now much more the prioritization of spending within cash flow\/delivering free cash flow. You're restructuring the sources of past volatility on the sand and the pressure pumping front.","I wondered if you could just talk to the cultural mindset of capital execution and making sure that is throughout the company. Can you speak to your efforts to ensure execution and that $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion won't need to get raised later in the year?","J.D. Hall","Yes, Brian. I mean, this is obviously a focus for us in 2019. We deal with these things both organizationally and through initiatives. So we have a dedicated team that's daily focused on looking at our daily cost and ensuring that the cost that we've projected will be met in 2019. We're making evaluation every single day on whether or not we're meeting those targets.","So my experience has been as leading operations for over 20 years is that what gets focused on gets fixed. And we're certainly taking that seriously as an organization and it will be our primary focus.","I think it's also important to say that a lot of the things that we've been doing to learn and understand how these reservoirs work together, a lot of that stuff is behind us. As Tim mentioned earlier, we're dialing in on what our completions are, so there's a lot of -- not of -- there's not a lot of uncertainty onto what our execution plan is.","So having a consistent plan in front of you also goes a long way towards helping you understand what your costs are going to be. So I think all those things combined together are going to lead to a greater capital discipline in 2019.","Brian Singer","Appreciate that. The range of CapEx is appreciated. So thank you very much.","J.D. Hall","Sure, Brian.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Tim Dove","Hi, John.","John Freeman","Hi. Just following-up on Brian's question and Doug earlier just to make sure that I'm sort of thinking about this the right way sort of the context of a previous kind of $110 million plan, and the increasing importance on the free cash flow. So on that slide 9, the kind of waterfall slide that you show where you basically say above the $53 a barrel number that is embedded in your current plan and shows the amount of free cash flow you have above that and the options for that cash. And you've talked about previously like a $5 improvement in oil the prices $400 million of incremental cash.","I guess just for 2019, if theoretically in oil price, it's $5 higher than what your plan is kind of how you think about how much of that goes to free cash flow versus the previous kind of plan, which was kind of we should always assume kind of two incremental rigs each year roughly to get to that one million barrel target. Just sort of how we think about the trade-offs of the two?","Tim Dove","Well, first thing I'd say is, we don't really consider the million barrel target as the main driver here. We're trying to focus on capital discipline and making sure we deliver returns at the bottom line and continue our focus on free cash flow generation. Let me state that first.","But when you take a look at how that money would be allocated to the extent we -- a $53-plus case in terms of WTI or $60-plus Brent case, we've got a lot of different options there. I think the real question is, how sustainable will that price be? In other words, are we in a different environment, we're in a $70 Brent case that would change some of our ideas regarding all of the different potential areas to allocate the capital.","In terms of 2019 decision-making, we have put a range out there of capital to make sure that everybody understands it. We haven't made any decisions on adding rigs yet in 2020, but there is a range and a capital for us to consider that. So that will be something we look at as we go through the remainder of this year, particularly as we get into the summer. But the range of capital is intended to cover anything we might need to add if we decide to do so in 2019 to address a 2020 run rate.","John Freeman","That's great. Thanks. And then just my follow-up question, given that you've got about 40% of the activity this year on these larger scale projects versus the 10% last year. I was actually impressed that the POP times didn't appear to materially go up as you would normally sort of assume with the bigger projects. I assume that's maybe some of what Joey was talking about with the big improvements on the drilling and the completion cycle times. But I'm wondering if you can just kind of give us just rough numbers on how those larger-scale projects kind of would -- the POP times kind of roughly look like on those versus the rest of the plan. I am assuming as we go forward, we're going to continue to have an increasing amount of the activity on these larger-scale projects when we think about 2020 and beyond.","J.D. Hall","Yes. John, the way that I would look at it is typically speaking a three-well pad takes about 170 days to POP. And for every well you add to a pad, you're basically going to have 30 to 40 days. And we've got a mixture of about 50% still three-well pads in 2019. So it's important to keep some of those three-well pads in there, so you keep the consistent cycle of POP-ing wells.","And then about 40% of our plan will be four-well pads and greater, but only a small percentage of those are seven and eight-well pads. So I think that it just goes to show that a good mixture of three-well pads and larger pads gives us the ability to deliver consistently on POPs as opposed to a whole program full of eight-well pads.","A \u2013 Tim Dove","And I think the average in site would be about 150 days. We're going about 200. That accounts for all that average of all the different types of pads.","J.D. Hall","Yes.","Q \u2013 John Freeman","Thanks guys, appreciate it.","J.D. Hall","Thanks John.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Q \u2013 Jeanine Wai","Hi, good morning everyone.","J.D. Hall","Hi Jeanine.","Q \u2013 Jeanine Wai","Hi. I guess back to the 2019 guide following up on a few other questions. We've been seeing a bunch of 2019 outlook being anchored at $50 WTI which has become I mean like the kind of thing like your gold standard for showing free cash flow at lower oil prices. And we recognize that $50 could very well be as arbitrary as $53. But what was the thought process on using $53 WTI as a planning deck? I mean this is really kind of more of a messaging question versus an operational question. Is there something operationally that's driving the 21 to 23 rigs for this year versus further moderating activity?","A \u2013 Tim Dove","Well first of all on your first question, the reason we have used $53 is only because it helps on the parlance of how you discuss United States business. But the fact is all of our business is based on Brent crude oil prices. We're actually focused on a $60 Brent case, so let's start there. So we'll just use the generic differential of $7. So it's more like the parlance or the IRSP if we put -- when we say $60 Brent we really are just translating that into $53 WTI. And the rig count of course is just a product of how capital-efficient we are. We were able to actually use less rigs to achieve more outcomes in terms of POPs and that's fundamental to the idea of capital efficiency.","Q \u2013 Jeanine Wai","Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question is related to capital efficiency. As we look forward to 2020, how do you see your corporate breakeven trending from the current $53? And are the primary drivers of that kind of progressively larger and larger pads? Is it you continue to see more incremental upside from completion improvement that you're always working on? Or is there structurally kind of more things that you're working on to reduce nonproductive CapEx?","A \u2013 Tim Dove","We're doing all of the above. NPT is a huge drain in our business and so we have a heavy focus on reducing it. And just back to what Joey said it is focusing on the details regarding -- every detail of the drilling and completion process, so as to reduce nonproductive time. But it's across the board. It's all different types of efficiencies we're looking at to make sure we can achieve at a high level.","Jeanine Wai","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on some of the earlier questions. We hear from -- I don't want to beat this too much, but we hear from some of the market that increasing interest in the sector from investors may require a free cash flow yield that approaches that of the broader market or closer to 5%. Do you view that as a reasonable outcome for Pioneer down the line? And if so, do you envision that as something that it will happen organically on its own as you continue to get more efficient? Or do you need to proactively continue to reduce capital outlays and growth?","Tim Dove","I think it will happen to us on its own. Now the question is what day it occurs for us, right, because we have certain things that we're spending money on right now that are necessary that would put that day off. So the example is the Midland water treatment facility. That facility is going to be materially finished by the end of 2020 and it will be done. At that point in time you've got a significant bump to your available cash flow and therefore a push towards free cash flow generation.","We have a certain cost, which has to be paid in the next couple of years including for example some of the Eagle Ford deficiency fees that are the same -- over the same -- that is to say that there are payments that have to be made. And, therefore, when those are done it gives us a significant shot in the arm on free cash flow generation capabilities.","And so the main thrust though should be actually drilling high rate of return wells on a repetitive basis and a growing basis and that's where you really get your free cash flow yield, especially if you have reasonable commodity prices. What that means is you have margins, which support the business. That's really one of our key focuses. The rest of these things are going to occur. We're going to finish the water plant. We'll finish our deficiency fees and so on. It's really the generation of high-margin wells, which is really the ultimate goal, so as to then generate a free cash flow yield, which is competitive.","Ryan Todd","Right. I appreciate that. Maybe one other, I know we asked you about this periodically but given the continued success of your appraisal programs like the Stackberry project derisking, the Jo Mill, the lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp D combined with a slightly moderated growth rate you already purely in inventory and resource depth is quite enormous. At what point might it make sense to carve off additional portions of acreage and maybe at the bottom end of your portfolio and monetize those?","Tim Dove","Yeah. I think we're looking at -- we look at that all the time. In fact there's a couple efforts underway to do exactly that and look at -- in any portfolio of course you have a tale of opportunity which isn't as strong as this \u2013 as your best projects. And so therefore, those are being looked at in terms of the potential for divestiture. Also of course, every day we look at the situation vis-\u00e0-vis our inventory. And we have a tremendous inventory and we look at situations where wells won't be drilled for quite a long time at the inventory. And it's certainly, an opportunity to look at to monetize some of the things, we won't get to for three decades let's say. So those are certainly under consideration.","Of course, it depends on exactly what the market is. Right now, the market is not terribly strong for the sale of acreage. And so that's a little bit of a governor for today. But that said, our real money has been made in trades. We traded 5.7 million acres last year, which added basically 36,000 acres. But the bottom line is everything is under consideration whether it's selling certain acreage, because they're lower in the inventory or because it will be a long time in coming. We're going to do whatever is in the best interest of our shareholders.","Ryan Todd","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matt Portillo","Good morning, all.","Tim Dove","Hi, Matt.","Matt Portillo","Tim a question regarding capital allocation, there's been a lot of focus this morning on the D&C side of the ledger. But just curious how the market should think about investment in gas facilities and water infrastructure over the next few years versus the $300 million guidance in 2019?","Tim Dove","Well, certainly I think I've addressed water facility. We are essentially completed with our water project in Midland, which is going to afford us relatively very cheap when we say water supply of 240,000 barrels a day after the investment in this facility. That is done as of 2020. So you can count that as already up, as a significant reduction in facilities. Right now, of course, we've had a great relationship with Targa in processing gas in the basin. And of course, we are going to need more gas processing in the basin in the future, so we'll have to evaluate the further investment in that. But for the time being, we've got two new plants coming on here in the first and second quarter.","Matt Portillo","Great. And just a follow-up question, around cost savings on a go-forward perspective. You've laid out very clear line of sight to some of the contractual changes. I was just curious, is there any incremental color you could provide on the potential shift as you move to these larger pad developments and ultimately what that might mean in terms of some long-term improvements around capital efficiency?","J.D. Hall","Yeah. Matt, we're \u2013 I mean obviously whenever you do the same thing repeatedly on one location it has several synergies. One is just the repeatability of drilling rig going down the line and drilling more than two or three wells at a time. But also the ability to have reduced facilities and flow lines and things of that nature. So pad by pad, it's different.","But I would say just as a minimum benchmark that our expectation is the full cycle we would expect to save 5% to 10% full cycle on a larger-scale development as compared to some of the smaller ones. Again, the thing that I emphasize is that that's great on an absolute basis. But the thing that you're countering it with is the spud-to-POP cycle times. So we try to balance what -- where we're gaining the EUR is where another big benefit comes from whenever we're codeveloping these wells. So we're trying to balance all those things in order to get the most capital-efficient program we can each year.","Tim Dove","Yes. And I would only add that we calculate that as of the end of the year 2018. We're about two-thirds done with the entire field development. There's one-third more to do. It's going to take a few years to get that done as it already has taken a few years to get to the first two-thirds done. But there's line of sight a few years from now where incremental capital going to basically would amount to facilities such as all the tank batteries, flow line necessities and also related to saltwater disposal would've been substantially completed. We don't have an exact target date on that. But I can tell you we calculate we're two-thirds done.","Matt Portillo","Thank you very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Dove at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Tim Dove","Thanks, Anna. We appreciate everybody taking time to be on the call. And we look forward to 2019 as being a stellar year. We're really focused on all the things we've mentioned. And I'm really looking forward to our performance for this year. And I think everyone will be pleased when we have the same call a year from now. And in the meantime, hope you enjoy your Valentine's Day. Thanks very much.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"17273":["Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Jena. Good day, everyone, and thanks again this quarter for joining us. I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim will be the first speaker. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2017, another strong quarter for Pioneer and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year. He'll also provide some thoughts post 2017 and some of the things we're looking at down the road.

And lastly, Rich is going to summarize the third quarter financials and he'll provide guidance for the fourth quarter. After that, as always, we're going to open up the call for any questions that folks on the line may have.","So with that, Tim, I'll turn the call over to you.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Frank. And first, a shout-out to all of our friends in Houston. I know it was a tough third quarter there, everybody went through down there, but nonetheless, hopefully last night helps to vindicate at least a powerful positive spirit for the city. So congratulations for that. Pioneer's third quarter results show that the company is executing at a very high level of efficiency. Our horizontal oil production is up substantially. Our POPs were right on schedule for the quarter and our operating costs were down. And as you've seen, our Eagle Ford drilling program has been very successful thus far.","We had an excellent quarter from the standpoint of income generation. We had adjusted income of $80 million, realizing we have relatively low breakevens in our company. And even at today's oil and gas prices, that's a substantial amount of income generation, considering where those commodity prices are, that represented about $0.48 per diluted share. As you'll recall, we preannounced production post the hurricanes and also our price realizations. Those were released both on October 12. That said, this is somewhat old news as to where the third quarter production came in.","What's important is we did see a very dramatic increase in overall production, that's in terms of BOEs, even though it was negatively affected by the hurricane and third-party processing downtime in our West Panhandle facilities.","In fact, production would've been at the top end of the range had it not been for these issues. Importantly, oil production is up substantially. It's up about 10% overall in the third quarter compared to the second.","And in particular, if you look at the growth from our Permian Basin drilling operations, you can see very substantial increases in oil production growth of about 15% for the quarter. This goes to show that the campaign is, in fact, producing excellent results. And this is not just growth for growth's sake, of course. These growth numbers are really based on strong returns and high capital efficiency.","A component of that efficiency is the fact that we've been able to continue to focus on production costs. They were down again this quarter, down to about $6.01 per BOE. That's down compared to the second and also 2016's operating costs numbers. It's a product of the fact that our Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal wells show a very low-cost production. And in fact, for this quarter, it was about $1.85 per BOE.","Turning now to slide 4 and continuing with the highlights for the quarter. Hedging continues to be an important part of our go-forward strategy and toward that end, we did add derivatives in the quarter, 59,000 barrels a day of oil and 83 million cubic feet a day of gas.","Combination of three-way collars and swaps to the point where now, we have derivatives that cover over 80% of 2018's oil production forecast and over 35% of our gas. So that puts us in a very good position going forward, protected against what might be possible downturns in commodity prices as we go forward.","The balance sheet continues to look very strong with $2.1 billion of cash and liquid investments on hand. And accordingly, we continue to have very low debt ratios as shown on slide 4.","We've become a very significant player in world export markets and I think that will continue through time. As shown in the slide, we exported 1.4 million barrels of WTI during the third quarter and expect that number to be 2.3 million barrels during this quarter.","The last three cargoes interestingly have gone through various areas of the world, including South Korea and Japan as well as into Wales. It's really quite possible, if you look at our numbers internally, that our export volumes could quadruple next year compared to this year.","In fact, it's possible by the end of 2018, we would be exporting 100,000 barrels a day. So this is going to be a bigger and bigger component of our plan going forward. I'd say more importantly though, with the Brent-WTI spread having widened to, let's say, $7 to $8 per barrel, our most recent sales have been accomplished at a premium to WTI of nearly $5.","And accordingly, those sales are just not moving oil, they're making substantial value-adds when compared to our alternatives for domestic sales. Really, we do need the exports to move all this incremental oil that's going to be coming out of the Permian Basin and we're making significant strides toward that end.","Turning now to slide 5. First of all, we reached a significant milestone this quarter. We spudded our 1,000th horizontal well in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp trend in the third quarter. That's a fantastic result and we're way ahead, of course, from that standpoint in terms of gaining knowledge about how to properly drill and complete these wells having now done over 1,000.","As we've been discussing on the road and with many investors and analysts, we've been considering the acceleration of rigs that were planned for later in 2018 in order to improve our operational flexibility. And toward that end, we decided to pull the trigger on adding two rigs to improve our operational flexibility by adding to our drilled, but as yet uncompleted well count. And what that will do, of course, is give us flexibility going forward.","The DUCs that will be added in the first half of the year will then be resulting in the fact that we'll have production growth met just as we would have in the original plan later in 2018. So what we're essentially doing is bringing these rigs in early. It doesn't really have much effect on the longer-term growth forecasts for 2018. That does lead us to having 20 rigs in place in the Permian Basin, 16 of those being in the North.","That will add to our capital needs for 2017. We're adding a total of $50 million, one part of it being the addition of those two rigs and the other part related to the fact that we're using third-party frac fleets in the Eagle Ford shale and they've come in significantly higher in South Texas and it was in the plan. It is a fact that there's not much competition for fleets in South Texas. And so that's where you see some inflationary effects. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see that in the Permian as well. It doesn't really affect us to the extent we're operating mostly our own fleets.","We have been very successful this quarter in the implementation of the four-string casing design where it's necessary and it's probably today three-quarters of our wells. That number will be reduced going forward. We did put our \u2013 put the number of wells planned on production, our POPs were 61 during the quarter.","And if you look at that, 59 were Version 3.0 completions that continue to have excellent results when compared to Version 2.0. And a couple of those wells were completed in the Jo Mill and they also show excellent results. And our 3.0+ wells, although we've only done 12, really look good and Joey is going to show you some curves on all of these. But suffice it to say, our EUR's and our performance from wells is staggering in terms of its positive impact on production. And we expect that to continue going forward.","The POP number for the fourth quarter would be about 70. That will get us to the 230 target that we've already put out in terms of the goal for 2017. Again, the returns are very strong, even based on $50 oil and $3 gas. We still see 40% to 75% rates of return just from the drilling campaign and that has allocated capital for facilities needs as well. So I think the returns will stay exceedingly strong even going into 2018.","Turning now to slide six. I already mentioned earlier the outstanding results we've seen in the Eagle Ford campaign this year. Recall that we're completing 20 wells. Nine of those were DUCs and 11 were new wells. The objective was to drill longer laterals, have the wells be wider spaced than their earlier campaigns and have higher intensity completions, along the lines more of what we use in the Permian Basin to see if we could positively impact results.","Returns look good. I mean, they're still 30% to 40% even based on $3 gas and $50 oil themselves. But importantly, we've seen that these new wells that we've already put on, a couple of them were the new drills and nine were the DUCs in the last couple quarters. They've basically 2X'd their prior \u2013 the prior campaign wells over the early part of their production. That's really encouraging. It means that we may have uncovered a significant amount of value from this drilling campaign in terms of the future inventory wells to be drilled.","A couple more wells have been POP'd here in early October, so we're just starting to see those results. And the last seven are expected to be POP'd in November. So we'll have a lot more data for you as it relates to this on the fourth quarter call coming up in February. We can give you a full recap of how those wells have done.","In West Panhandle, this has already been explained from the standpoint of the October release, but we did have a fire at a third-party plant handling our processing volumes in the West Panhandle field. This is a Sunray plant and we had to quickly redirect this gas. It took some work from the standpoint of plumbing and spending some money to get the gas redirected to another plant. But suffice it to say, that's now been completed.","The gas has been re-piped and now being processed at another facility in Spearman, Texas. It's about 8,000 barrels of oil per day. We did lose production as a result of that. That's part of the total 3,500 barrels a day of production, which we lost that impacted the third quarter in addition to the volumes that were attributable to the hurricane.","Now turning to slide seven. Our capital remains essentially the same, except for what I mentioned earlier, which is the accounting for the addition of the two rigs for the balance of this year in Permian and also the incremental completions cost in the Eagle Ford from third parties, such that the total is now estimated to be $2.75 billion for the year.","Importantly, our cash flow is coming in roughly at $1.9 billion, I think that's likely conservative because it's based on $49, $50 going forward for the fourth quarter on oil today with prices at about $54, that $1.9 billion is likely conservative. But nonetheless, I think we have a good wherewithal to enter 2018 with an exceptionally strong balance sheet after having completed this year's campaign.","Turning to slide eight. We continue to be on target to meet all of our growth goals, both for the fourth quarter and for all of this year, 2017. That's in terms of overall growth as well as oil growth. And importantly, after we finish the fourth quarter, it will represent the completion of the first year in our march to produce the 1 million barrel plus BOE per day, basically in nine more years, and that would include 700,000 barrels a day of oil at that time and we'll have more on that in a couple slides.","On slide nine then, the long-term goal, when it comes to that 10-year plan, is supported by the fact that Pioneer's acreage sits in essentially the best rock in one of the lowest breakeven oil price basins in the country. And as shown in the graph here on slide nine, from sell-side research, you could see that the Permian Midland Basin breakeven oil price at roughly $24 per barrel is one of the lowest, if not, the lowest in North America. In essence, it's this benefit, the rock in the Midland Basin that gives us a distinct advantage in terms of returns.","Slide 10 then shows a different way to look at it. This is a snapshot of where Pioneer's breakeven is on that same third-party analysis as compared to many companies in the shale business in the U.S. So when that data is broken down by company, you can see where our oil breakeven shakes out, again at the bottom of the list, compared to a long list of our E&P brethren. And it's this advantage that gives us confidence in our longer-term plan to execute based on those high returns.","Slide 11. As a result of the prior couple of slides, our 10-year vision remains very much intact, to produce that 1 million barrels plus really within the \u2013 in the next nine years or so, and it reflects really organic growth. We don't have to go acquire acreage, we don't have to acquire leases to do that. We already have the locations basically sitting underneath our acreage that will allow us to grow at 15% plus.","But the important thing is, we're drilling very high rate of return wells and that's just a product of our low breakevens, among other things, as shown on the prior two slides, where we have very low cost and high returns and accordingly, low breakeven numbers. And those are very significant positives going forward from the standpoint of executing on this plan.","I think vertical integration and our technology enhancements, we've talked about in the past, are a very significant contributor to that plan going forward. Vertical integration of course is a big positive for us in the sense that it's going to protect us from inflationary moves going forward as well in terms of costs, notwithstanding the fact it helps us to execute at a high level as well. A very important goal that we've been focused on of course is to get to a point where we are basically cash flow-neutral compared to our spending.","This depends to a great extent, needless to say, on oil prices and in fact if you take a look at the modeling, our cash flow breakeven where we're spending an amount equal to our cash flow in 2020 would be based on a $50 oil price. It's possible that could be achieved in 2018 depending upon what happens to the oil price.","We would calculate that between $57 and $58, in that range, it would actually be cash flow breakeven for 2018. So we're rapidly moving in that direction. It's just a matter of price as to when we get there.","Incidentally, related to that, the overall cash flow growth rate is higher than the overall production growth rate. It's about 20% per year. It's due to the fact that we're drilling high cash flow and high rate of return wells that have significant margins owing to the fact they're mostly oil.","We have accomplished a lot for 2018 in the derivatives program. As I said, we feel like we're in good shape there and the balance sheet is in good position to support this plan going forward. We've always had a very heavy focus on improving corporate returns. You should realize that we already have many, many metrics inside the company we use related to compensation that cover these exact points. For instance, internally related to our annual compensation programs, we have goals on production per share, on operating costs, on F&D, on reserve replacements and G&A, our balance sheet metrics.","And also ROE and ROCE and NAV per share, so we already have those all internally. And so the change we really plan to make only at this point going forward is to include a couple of those metrics, probably the growth per share metric and the return metric in our proxy filing in April of 2018. But the fact is we're already utilizing those goals internally. So now it's just a matter of codifying that from the standpoint of our proxy filing, which you'll see us do in a form next year.","So to summarize, I think the third quarter was an excellent quarter for us. Our level of execution and performance that we pride ourselves on at PXD was reached for this quarter and I expect that to continue going forward as we prosecute over the next nine years as well.","And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Joey for his comments on the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp results for the quarter.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everybody. I'll be picking up on slide 12. This is basically my punchline slide. We're now operating 20 rigs. Version 3.0 remains the standard completion. I'm going to cover results on our larger completions here in just a second.","You can see our budgeted lateral lengths, well costs and EURs. Combine that with our low operating cost of $4 to $5 and that results in strong IRRs of 40% to 75% at 15.3%.","Moving to slide 13, here, we are showing results from 12 of our Version 3.0+ wells for four of our 3-well pads. All of these wells were POP'd in Q2, which is significant because now, we have four to six months' worth of production data. All the tests continue to be promising; with longer production history we can now start to assess the economics of these wells compared to their 3.0 offsets and see where they will go for us in future programs.","I do believe we're narrowing in on optimal water volumes and now we're trying to find the sweet spot on proppant combined with cluster spacing and stage lengths. The only variables not noted on our slide is cluster spacing and stage length, which we believe is a second-tier lever impacting well performance.","And just going around the page, if you look at our Lower Spraberry Shale, those were completed with 40-foot cluster spacing and 240-foot stage length. The HUD and South University Wolfcamp Bs were completed with 30-foot cluster spacing and 150-foot stage length. And the Pembrook wells were completed with 20-foot cluster spacing and 100-foot stage length. The reason I point that out is because it illustrates that with all these combinations, Pioneer's strong belief that one size definitely doesn't fit all and we continue to cater our completions to the areas and the zones with which we're drilling.","Other points of interest on completions, we did successfully execute our 100% sliding sleeve well on a 3-well pad. We shifted over 150 sleeves in each one of the three wells, so close to 500 sleeves shifted. The wells are on production and we are evaluating the results of those wells. We're also interpreting the results of the stimulation phase of our fiber optic test and are now collecting data on that same well during the production phase and so we'll be evaluating those results here in the near future.","So now, I'll be moving on to slide 14. Just a real quick Jo Mill update. We did add two new wells in Q3 in the Northern part of our acreage. The significance of these two wells is that they represent our first spacing test, so we're going to be looking forward to the results of those two wells. The other nine wells continued to exhibit strong performance.","Now moving on to slide 15 and my last slide. Strong production results, despite the impacts from Hurricane Harvey of 1,300 BOEs per day, is noted in the upper left, ending the quarter at 231,000 BOEs per day, a 9% increase over Q2. As Tim mentioned, we did place 61 wells online, bringing our total to 160 for the year. And we are reiterating our expectation to grow production 30% to 32% over our 2016 production.","For Q4, we will continue to evaluate our completion optimization tests and determine how they fit into our 2018 program. And so bottom line overall, a great quarter for our Permian team and we are looking forward to a strong finish to 2017.","And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ken Sheffield, and he'll cover some impressive results from South Texas.","Kenneth H. Sheffield, Jr. - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Joey, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 16, Pioneer's ramping up our 2017 drilling and completion program in the Eagle Ford. The plan is to complete and POP 20 wells during the year, including nine DUCs drilled about a year ago and on the 11 new wells, testing design changes expected to significantly increase recovery. The design changes include longer laterals, increased well spacing, tighter counter cluster spacing and higher proppant concentrations. The cumulative effect of the design changes are expected to yield EURs averaging 1.3 million barrels equivalent, with IRRs ranging from 30% to 40% on the new wells.","We've seen excellent results from the wells we POP'd to date and results are summarized on the next slide.","Turning to slide 17. The upper left chart shows the 2017 program results compared to the most recently drilled Eagle Ford wells in 2015 and the early part of 2016. Average cumulative production charted in red from the 9 DUCs POP'd in Q2 and Q3 is more than two times higher than prior program wells charted in blue. This is a result of more intense completions and longer laterals.","Average cumulative production charted in orange from the two new design wells is showing even stronger results. At the end of Q3, we have 11 of the 20 planned POPs online. Nine new drills are expected to POP in 4Q, with two wells POP'd early in October.","We are very pleased with the results to date, looking forward to closing out the remaining POPs and integrating these strong results into plans for the future.","I'll now turn it over to Rich Dealy to review financial results.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, and I'm going to start on slide 18, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share. It did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses of $103 million or $0.61 per diluted share. So as Tim mentioned, if you adjust for that, we had a really strong earnings for the quarter at $80 million or $0.48 per diluted share.","If you look at the middle of the page where we show Q3 guidance relative to our actual results, you'll see that we are within guidance or on the positive side of the guidance of all the items listed here. So overall, an exceptionally strong quarter for the company.","Turning to slide 19 and looking at price realizations. As you can see, oil prices were up 1% quarter-over-quarter. NGL prices were up 12%, most of that coming from both propane and butane prices and ethane prices to a smaller extent. And so really seeing NGL pricing increase during the quarter helped our realizations there. Gas prices were down 2% to $2.58 per MCF.","These results do exclude $29 million of cash receipts from our hedging activity that came in during the quarter. If you look at the bottom of the slide, you can see the impact of those to our pricing and if you include those hedging results.","Turning to slide 20, looking at production cost per BOE. You see that production costs in total were down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding taxes, production costs were down also 3% versus Q2, sorry, and 11% versus 2016. The decline is primarily due to our increasing production from our lower-cost horizontal Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells. And if you look at over the past two years, production costs, excluding taxes, have averaged $2.25 per BOE on our horizontal Spraberry\/Wolfcamp production.","The other item of note here is workover costs. They were higher during the quarter, primarily associated with vertical well activity and really as a result of higher oil prices and improving economics, we were able to repair those wells and put them back on to production.","Turning to slide 21, looking at our liquidity position, as Tim mentioned, we continue to have an excellent balance sheet and strong liquidity. If you look at the end of the quarter, we had net debt of $600 million, reflecting gross debt of $2.7 billion and cash on hand of $2.1 billion, completely unutilized credit facility at $1.5 billion of capacity there. And our debt ratios, as Tim mentioned earlier, are great.","If you look at the maturity schedule, in the middle of the page there, you can see our next bond maturity is in 2018 and our current plan is to pay those bonds off with cash on hand in May of next year.","Turning to slide 22 and really switching gears and looking at the fourth quarter guidance, you'll see the daily production, an increase from where we were this quarter, up to 292,000 BOEs to 302,000 BOEs per day. The rest of the items on this page are consistent with prior quarters, other than two. I'll note the production costs with our continuing decline in production cost. We did lower that range to $7.50 to $9.50 per BOE, and we also lowered our DD&A rate guidance range from $13.50 to $15.50 per BOE, really reflecting the additional proved reserves that we're adding from our successful drilling program.","So with that, I'll stop there, Jena, and we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dave Kistler of Simmons\/Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Simmons\/Piper Jaffray","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Dave.","David Kistler - Simmons\/Piper Jaffray","Picking up a little bit on your comment of cash flow neutrality at certain prices, I think you were saying $57 to $58, we get to cash flow-neutral. In the event, knowing you're well hedged, but with collars, in the event that prices did hit those levels, would that be the goal to be cash flow-neutral? Or would you redeploy to accelerate activity?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Dave, as you know, we've been talking about this for some time when we rolled out the 10-year plan that one of our objectives is kind of keep the RPMs steady from the standpoint of our operational goals. And I think if we really hit $57 to $58, we probably would just be the beneficiary of not overspending at all in 2018 and we would probably keep it at that because I think you can see that we're running at a high degree of efficiency. And adding RPMs, I think, would probably be inefficient from the standpoint of diminishing returns based on \u2013 we expect to see inflation in some areas. And as a result, I think we will stay pat with our plan for 2018.","David Kistler - Simmons\/Piper Jaffray","Okay, appreciate that. And kind of thinking about the efficiency comment you just made, adding these incremental rigs a little bit earlier, building up a little larger POP inventory. With that kind of structure in place, are we looking at getting back to kind of 260 POPs a year? Just trying to get a sense for whether or not that's accelerating above and beyond that potentially for 2018.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think the current work we're doing, and of course, this is relatively preliminary from the standpoint of the fact we haven't gotten very far yet in terms of our 2018 capital budgeting, in terms of the dealings with the board and other matters. But current thought would be POPing significantly in excess of 230 wells next year. Probably the range is 250 to 275 wells.","Also in relation to bringing on the rigs earlier, we also will be building about a 20 DUC count build and that's just, as I mentioned earlier, related to improving our operational flexibility. So I think that's probably in the neighborhood of where the numbers will come out for 2018.","David Kistler - Simmons\/Piper Jaffray","And just one little follow-up on that, I apologize. But with that DUC build, really less \u2013 it sounds like less oriented on flexibility to accelerate activity, more oriented on ensuring seamless delivery of POPs to kind of get a more linear production cycle versus a kind of lumpy one that we've seen in the past?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think that's right, Dave. If you look at, I mean, needless to say, the rigs eventually, when you get to the second half of 2018, do exactly what they would've done had we added them then, which is add production in the second half of 2018 and into 2019.","But for the time being, the way they should be thought of is increasing our utilization rates on our frac fleets, basically affecting, in a positive way, our ability to make sure there are no delays. And in that sense, what we're doing is adding operational flexibility. So I would really say it's a culmination of the two, the early-stage being operational flexibility, having the number one priority, and secondly, it will then contribute to production growth in the second half of the year and into 2019.","David Kistler - Simmons\/Piper Jaffray","Okay. Appreciate the color guys. Thanks so much.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Tim, I was wondering if you could go through some of the objectives of the Eagle Ford delineation program and also just thoughts on the Jo Mill, could fit into the future plans from a development standpoint.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think, first of all, on the Eagle Ford, as you know, one of our main objectives was to make sure that we could actually get back to drilling economic wells. What I mean by economic is more economic than we've determined that the 2015 and 2016 campaign had delivered. We really got too far down-spaced, we felt like. And notwithstanding that, we are also, on a relative basis, completing those wells on shorter laterals with the old-style Eagle Ford frac, which we've now proven really was not as successful as we would expect when we put a Permian-style frac on that. So we really needed to make sure that we could understand how it is that we can improve the economics of wells.","The Eagle Ford, as you know, is an area where we produce a third natural gas and a third NGLs, in addition to a third condensate. So it has to be an area we needed to improve the economics of drilling, and I think we've done exactly that. So it definitely gives us a view towards the value of our inventory of drilling locations clearly improving.","On the Jo Mill, the Jo Mill has a very significant place going forward when it comes to our development planning. We've seen presentations internally, where over the next nine years, we'll be drilling quite a large number of Jo Mill locations as it relates to that plan and because these results looks so strong, I'm very encouraged by that.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up. This year, Tim, you're doing, I believe, a 15-well program with the Version 3.0+. I was wondering if you can comment on how the costs look like relative to 3.0 and how you're thinking about moving the program, shifting towards perhaps more Version 3.0+ completions in 2018 and beyond.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure. Well, first of all, if you look at the costs associated with the 3.0+ as compared to Version 3, you will add \u2013 depending upon how much you increase the sand utilization, between $500,000 and, let's say, $750,000 per well. So from that standpoint, you're looking at something that's probably not even 10% of the well cost. So from that standpoint also, when you look at the 3.0+ results, they look really outstanding and clearly well in excess of 5% or 10% (34:34) improvement. So I think what's going to prove out is that the 3.0+ may eventually become a standard if this were to bear out.","That said, we're not going to make any decisions based on 15 wells and for that matter, a relatively short history on those 15 wells. So we're evaluating right now how many wells to complete utilizing 3.0+ for 2018. And then as has been our case through time, if you remember, we went from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0, in each case, taking a significant amount of time to make sure we knew what we're accomplishing when it came to improving economics. We're going to do the same thing here. So we need some time to see more 3.0+ wells. It wouldn't surprise me that 3.0+ would become the standard, but we need to get some more data before we can go there.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Morning, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, can I \u2013 maybe it's Joey wants to take this one, but if I can go back to slide 13, I just wonder if you just revisit your comments about the changes in well design that you were talking about. Did I hear you correct that you're running 150-stage sliding sleeve designs in these wells? How many have you done? Are you seeing significant differences versus the prior design? Just walk us through what the thought process there, please.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure. To clarify, we've only done one pad of three wells, each one had 156 sliding sleeves. The most important thing to back up on is why we did the test. This was in Lower Spraberry Shale and we did it for two objectives. Number one, whenever you're in the shallower, lower pressured zones, it creates some \u2013 a little bit less efficient on the drill outside and makes it more difficult to drill your plugs out. So obviously, if you have sliding sleeves, you eliminate all plugs and that takes care of that particular issue.","But the other thing is if you can figure out how to do it efficiently, you can get more clusters per the entire wellbore. The only challenge with it right now is it's relatively new technology. So the operational piece of it's kind of slow. But for us, the most important piece is seeing how the production comes out because whenever you do a sliding sleeve, in essence, you're stimulating one cluster at a time instead of five or six clusters at a time.","So this whole debate that people sometimes get into on how effectively are you stimulating in each individual cluster when there's multiple clusters per stage, using the sliding sleeves eliminates that debate and you effectively get 100% of your clusters stimulated because you're only stimulating one cluster at a time.","So we see this as a long-term strategy that could expand. There's also some new technologies evolving regarding interventionless sliding sleeves, where you don't have to use coil tubing, because that's one of the challenges associated with these sliding sleeves. So for us, this is more determining, one, how does the individual cluster stimulation work. Operationally, we think there's room for improvement. But we see this as something we wanted to test to see how it fits into our long-term strategy.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I realize as a test, the cost may not be comparable, but just for reference, how did the production compare to what you're describing as the Version 3 and similarly with the costs?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So it's very early. We just turned these wells on in the last month or month and a half, so it's too early to tell. I will tell you that I think preliminary indications are that \u2013 and again, very early, that they are \u2013 appear to be performing comparable to our 3.0+ wells. But again, it's very early. One of the things that we've learned with these higher water volumes is that it takes just a little bit longer for us to understand the full performance of the wells and so it's really too early to make a conclusion.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I appreciate that. I just had a couple of quick follow-ups, if I may. Tim, the Version 3.0+, is the guidance that you've given in terms of the breakeven for next year, does that assume the Version 3.0 or the Version 3.0+?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Everything we're doing right now, Doug, is defaulted to 3.0.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And last one from me is, really, just going back to the earlier question about the Eagle Ford and, I guess, the general portfolio outside of the Permian, still a decline drag on the very strong growth from the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp program. What is the longer term prognosis for the ex-Permian assets? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Doug. Yeah, I think what we're going to be doing is evaluating all of these wells and their impact on the inventory. And if you look at what we've seen so far, it's been dramatically positive. We've been able to essentially 2x the prior campaign's drilling results. And I take it as some encouragement that this inventory is actually showing signs of really significant recovery when it comes to economics.","Of course, we also have to weigh how those wells compare on a relative return basis after we get all the data with how the Permian campaign is shaping up in terms of returns. I think that will be something we evaluate as we see the fullness of the program completed here with these seven wells, putting those on production in November and watching their production. We'll make some assessments as to that question as we get into the early part of next year.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Do you plan any capital in the Eagle Ford in 2018?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, that's the question we're addressing. The question is how much capital will we spend based on how the well results appear? And that's just a part of our evaluations for the whole budget for 2018.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Freeman of Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When looking at the Eagle Ford, I realize you slightly lowered sort of the IRRs given the higher cost, but it looks like you're still using the same 1.3 MMBOE EUR guidance. And when I look at the update we had last quarter and you were looking at kind of a 20% productivity uplift on these new completions and now, it's basically doubling. It's like the longer these wells are online, it looks like the outperformance is getting meaningfully wider. Just sort of the thoughts on maybe when you might reevaluate the type curves that you all were using.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, hey, John. This is Frank. I think when you look at it, you're spot on to what we're seeing. I think, though, as Tim referred to and Ken, when they were talking about it, we just don't have a lot of data on these wells yet. And matter of fact, we have some that we're just about to POP here, as Ken mentioned. So I think over time, those numbers could go up. But for the time being, we just assume the 1.3 MMBOE EUR.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just my follow-up, sticking with the Eagle Ford, obviously, on the well costs, you all mentioned it was mainly due to these \u2013 the third-party frac fleets just where the prices went. I'm just curious if all this would have you all potentially consider, reconsider potentially using or activating, starting up additional of your own fleets just given where the costs are of if that's still kind of off the table.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Certainly, I think we can consider that. I mean, realizing today, we operate, among our whole set of fleets, depending upon the day, six or seven fleets. That said, we have eight to \u2013 fleet number eight and nine, I should say, which are today not being utilized and need to be refurbed. So any decision along those lines would await refurbishing those fleets, which is probably going to be a 2018 project, so it's certainly not in the short term.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, you mentioned 250 to 275 POPs, wells POPs in 2018. Should they be back end-loaded like 2017 and any CapEx range there? Also, any downside to your $300 million infrastructure spend with Brady mine behind you and infrastructure spend as well behind?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think if you look at the POP count, this is more of an estimate of the overall number. We have not gotten yet into the granularity of exactly how they're going to be mapped out in the year. And of course, that's a complicated matter related to when the rigs are there, how the pads are arranged in terms of the order of completion. So we'll certainly have more color on that when we put out results for the fourth quarter on our views towards 2018. In fact, we'll probably give you a pretty detailed POP schedule at that time. So I think when you look at that, the number we give you right now is just more of a top-down consideration of where we're trying to land the thing. So I think from that standpoint, you can just kind of use it as a top-down number, and for the time being, just assume those are flat.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And the midstream?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes. If you look at the additional costs right now, first of all, we are postponing the expansion of our Brady plant, that's been well publicized as we evaluate the West Texas sand situation and \u2013 as an alternative to sand supply. So we don't have to expand the Brady plant today. We're evaluating its competitiveness from a go-forward standpoint and expansion versus these other alternatives. That said, we are going to need to be spending money on third-party processing.","Targa has two new plants planned for 2018, one coming in place in March and the other one in, roughly around September. Those will demand capital as well. We have our regular infrastructure needs of course going forward and compression in the field with Targa. But as I'd say, from the standpoint of other items, they're not really anything material other than the fact that as we already have said, our water systems will capture essentially the same amount of capital in 2018 as it did in 2017. So roughly flat at about $150 million or so compared to 2017. That's going to be the material numbers when it comes to our overall other expenditures.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Maybe second is a bigger picture question. And the producer question du jour pits growth versus return and corporate strategy where it really comes down to asset portfolio, managing risk and maximizing value. I know you have a deeper inventory than most of your peers and that's what allows you this 10-year outlook of high growth at low price. Yet just to harmonize where relatively more mature portfolios stack, when you look at the life of the asset, post 1 million barrels growth, I mean, do you see a multi-decade plateau where cash distribution has become a defining characteristic of the asset? Maybe just your thoughts there on returns versus growth and maximizing shareholder value longer term is appreciated. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","As I mentioned earlier, we're very heavily focused on getting to free cash flow generation actually. Our first goal is to get neutrality and then we'll work on free cash flow generation. So that's certainly one of our goals. But it's a little bit hard to forecast 10 \u2013 after 10 years, we're working hard in the next nine, but years 11 through 20, we have to get to work on, I guess, is what I'd say. But needless to say, we're going to be drilling probably 6,000 wells in our \u2013 over this whole 10-year period, including this year. And as you recall, our information, we've discussed over the years, has us with a 20,000-well inventory.","Internally, we show up to 35,000 locations depending upon price. And so from that standpoint, we can continue to move ahead from the standpoint of a growth profile. You have to decide at what point you want to limit the number of rigs you want to put to work when it becomes really a very large number operationally and from an efficiency standpoint. But certainly, in our case, we can show growth over the next nine years, as I said, with that issue just so \u2013 because of the inventory you mentioned. Others who don't have maybe the inventory or the set of economic wells to drill might not be in that situation. So it could lead to certain companies like ourselves and some of the companies with that larger profile continuing to grow, probably albeit at a lower rate in years 11 through 20.","But you may have an overall plateauing from the Permian Basin at that point simply because others might not be in that situation. Now that said, Permian Basin production at that time will be multiples of what it is today. So it's going to lead the United States in a very strong position from the standpoint of oil exports and their importance in terms of the global energy picture.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, very differentiated long-term outlook. But thanks for your comments.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. If I could maybe add on to that the last line of questioning. And with such a large inventory, and maybe this is a little bit of heresy to say this for a publicly operated company with such a long inventory of good stuff, but what type of consideration have you all made to the inventory that's out 10, 15 years if the market right now makes sense to actually harvest some of that to other buyers who are willing to pay for it and put it to work right away?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think that's a great question and it's something we consider all the time as we should because the fact is we have many, many locations just, as I just said, that are \u2013 probably won't be drilled for a decade or more. But that said, we're reticent to do anything in particular for a couple of reasons today. One is the fact that after some recent sales we've done in the Permian Basin, essentially all we have is core of the core property, what we would call Tier 1 property.","And accordingly, it's really the crown jewels of the United States oil and gas business, particularly the oil business, the oil shale business. So you've got to be really careful in consideration of that.","The second point is, we haven't even drilled some of the location \u2013 some of the zones yet. Realizing coming up, we are going to be drilling our first Clearfork well horizontally in Midland County. And as we've also said, we have not even drilled the Wolfcamp C well ourselves.","Fortunately, Parsley has done a great job drilling Wolfcamp Cs and we can let them delineate that. It proves up 900 to 1,000 Pioneer locations by doing so. In addition, we haven't drilled some of the deeper locations \u2013 deeper zones. That would be, for example, the Woodford, the Barnett and so on that are productive, we believe, from the standpoint of oil in the Midland Basin as well just as in some areas, you see them productive in the Delaware Basin. Haven't drilled a well there. It's deeper drilling, so it \u2013 and it's probably more gassy. So in the seriatim of locations, it may not be at the top of the list.","All that said, since we haven't drilled some of these locations, we don't want to put ourselves in a position where we convey assets or interests or zones where we don't even know what it is we own. So that occurs to me to be the reason to hold off on anything significant along the lines of what you're saying. That also said, technology changes have proven to be the key to where this basin is today. And I don't think we're done with technology change. And to the extent that we were to convey interest in assets or zones that otherwise would be unlocked as to their potential due to technology change, we would be remiss if we didn't see that technology change play out through time.","So although I think the idea is very elegant and I think it actually makes sense if we really needed capital, that's not really the situation we're in as we go towards a free cash flow-neutral or a free cash flow-generating model. So it's something that's top of mind, but not necessarily front-burner, let's put it that way.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate the response. And just so I understand one comment you made within that response, is there obviously the potential to maybe parse out a zone over time as you prove it up and would like to harvest some of the cash \u2013 harvest cash from an asset?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, I think a zone sale is a possibility. I mean, in essence, we've really done that in the South where our partners now, Sinochem owns the Wolfcamp and below and we continue to own the upper zones. That said, if you were to convey such a zone to another party that's going to come in and drill on our same footprint, that causes other issues, right? In other words, bumping into each other. It's also a situation you bring someone in and drill the same zones underneath areas where you're drilling other zones, you have competition for the same services. It theoretically is an inflationary effect you might get out of that. So that's certainly one of the alternatives, but it's not clear to me that it's without some peril.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay, that's great. And then as a follow-up, I think you'd mentioned that right now, you're doing about 75% four-string. And could you just give us an update on some of the recent progress there? How fast those wells are getting down if you're seeing some improvement as you do it a little bit more? And what could that percentage look like in 2018?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, okay. I will let Joey answer that question, Scott.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Scott, the four-string wells are going well. We've recently had some completed in as little as 22 days. As you see in our \u2013 in the slides, some of them are up to 30 days. But now that we've hit our rhythm with that design, we can continue to work to drive those durations down.","When you look into 2018, as Tim alluded to earlier, we're still working through the details of what the total portfolio mix is. I don't think it's a simple 75%-25% like we've communicated in the past. My expectation would be that going forward, you would start to see that go down based on two things.","Number one, just the portfolio of wells as we drill more Lower Spraberry Shale and Jo Mill and even some Wolfcamp As that may give us the benefit of being able to do some \u2013 go back to some three-string in areas where we're doing four-string. So our hope is to continue to progress the four-string, but also look for opportunity to go back to the three-string wherever we can.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tim, to you and your whole team there.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to, if we could go back to that slide 13, which I thought had a lot of interesting stuff in it, and explore maybe the \u2013 one of the suggestions perhaps that that slide gives about the variability within this Version 3.0 completion design. As I look at it, it looks like if you go to the higher end of that, of the Version 3.0+, on the Pembroke, on the Pembroke pad, those results actually don't look like they have as much uplift as the lower end of that 3.0+ intensity with the 50 barrels and the 3,000 pounds per foot.","So I wonder if you could kind of share what your preliminary thoughts in there and perhaps it dovetails to what Joey said in the prepared comments that you think you found the sweet spot on the barrels of water, but perhaps not on the other parameters.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, Charles, so one of the things to keep in mind if you look at that Pembroke test is that that's 100-barrel per foot test. Two things that should be noteworthy is number one, just by the fact that we put 100 barrels per foot in, it takes a long time for these wells to clean up.","And in \u2013 particularly, in the Pembroke wells, even whenever we do a more standard completion, for whatever reason, that particular area produces water for a long time before you even start to cut oil. So not predicting, but just telling you that by the nature of the completion and by the nature of the area, it's just going to take a little bit more time for us to understand what that curve looks like. And as you can see, we've only got 120 days' worth versus some of these others that are up to 180 days. So let's just wait and see how that plays out.","The other thing that you pointed out, and I think it's very noteworthy going back to the comments that I made is, we really do think we're starting to dial in on the water volumes. The question we're asking ourselves now is once you get that water volume dialed in, what is the optimal amount of sand that you can deliver with that amount of water? Because we all know that if you can get those two things combined perfectly, then you've gotten there. If you go back to 2014, we actually tried that in the opposite fashion one time with not very good results, where we thought we knew what the optimum amount of sand to be delivered was and we tried to reduce the amount of water.","We're actually going in reverse now. We know and we believe we know what the right amount of water is and now, we're trying to maximize our sand. So that's our mindset on this going forward.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful, in fact, Joey. And I really appreciate those, I guess, unseen variables there. And then Tim, perhaps a question back for you. When we talk about the \u2013 or when we kind of look at the impact of accelerating these two rig adds, can you give us an idea kind of on a Spraberry\/Wolfcamp program-wide basis, how many drilled, uncomplete wells in inventory were you looking at, say, in 2Q of this year? So kind of your work-in-process inventory and what kind of level do you think \u2013 do you expect you're going to get to on a program-wide basis maybe in the midpoint of the year next year that's going to allow you to be more efficient and avoid those stumbles?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's a great question, Charles, and that's right on point with what we're trying to achieve. First of all, we run a very tight ship \u2013 and to give you an idea what I mean by that is if you look at the industry today in Permian, there's 2,400 drilled but uncompleted wells. That's 7.5 wells per rig.","Today, if you look at, let's say, 2017 numbers, we have generally been 15 to 20 DUCs at any given time for 17 or 18 rigs. In other words, one well per rig. That just goes to show you how tightly run this business has been. That's a tremendously efficient operation. However, it also has the potential to be disruptive if there's any kind of delays and that's certainly the thing we're trying to avoid here.","By adding 20 DUCs or so, which is kind of the number we would expect to add as a result of cranking up a couple of our other rigs, we then get up to, let's say, a range of, let's just say, 35 to 40 DUCs. That's the sweet spot because we're going to have seven or eight completion units out there, frac fleets, three-well pads and that's kind of the number you need to make sure that you have always an option to go to another well to complete it if you have a delay on a rig or what have you.","So it's that kind of a number we're talking about. That said, it only gets us to about two wells per rig, which is way more efficient than the rest of the industry. But we're giving ourselves a little slack basically from an operational flexibility standpoint.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That makes sense and it's helpful detail. Thank you, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Michael.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","I guess I wanted to maybe come back a little bit on the question around potential efficiency gains from the Version 3.0 wells. To the extent those continue to support incremental use and you further the deployment of those new designs in 2018 and beyond, as you look at it, is it something that could be material enough from a capital efficiency standpoint to pull that breakeven timeframe forward? And if so, how far forward do you think it could...?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think that's right. Anything that we do to improve our margins, by definition, brings our cash flow neutrality date forward and that's exactly what would happen and has happened incidentally as we've gone from 1.0 to 3.0. If we look at going to 3.0+, it would have that same impact. So if we end up defaulting to 3.0+ at a later date, let's say, into 2018, and that in effect adds, what I mentioned before, which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000 to 700,000 per well, but you get this really significant kick in EURs and early production.","All of a sudden, you've incremented our growth rate, you've incremented the margins of the company. And in doing both of those, you accelerate your cash breakeven neutrality day significantly. So that's exactly what the results should be, to the extent we went that direction.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And have you attempted to maybe estimate what sort of timeframe impact that could have at this point yet? Or is that premature?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's too early. Like we mentioned earlier, with 15 wells, we're not doing much as to forward forecasting. We want to see more data, but there will be a time and place when we can actually give you those level of details.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Fair enough, look forward to it. And then I guess, on the remaining parts of the portfolio, you gave us the kind of 2017 expected declines on the Eagle Ford, or updated that number. I guess, how would you think about the declines on that business as well as the Raton, Panhandle in 2018? How should we kind of handicap those declines at this point?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think you already have the Eagle Ford number in there. I think you can actually look back at our materials and we have information on production from all the areas as to each quarter over the last couple of years or so. I'm referring specifically to slide 24. And if you look there, you can see Raton basically has been pretty flat. I mean, it's 100% methane, but you can see each of the last three quarters, it's produced within 1 million cubic feet a day of the prior quarter, so it's very flat.","West Panhandle is hard to assess simply because of the choppiness that's come out of this plant operation business we discussed earlier. But it generally, if you look back through time, has exhibited roughly about a 10% decline rate.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then the Eagle Ford though, that 35% is pretty fair going forward as well? That doesn't slow down at all?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's obviously a product of how much you drill, but that's correct. I mean, that's the basic fundamental decline rate.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then I guess, last one on my end would just be on the corporate return front, I guess, we have you this year at a kind of low single-digit type ROCE. How much can that improve, would you think, as you look over the next few years towards that breakeven timeframe in 2020? With the current plan in a sort of $50 world, do you all have a view on how that looks over time?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I'll let Rich answer that one, Michael.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think when you look at the modeling on it and the returns these wells are generating over the next four or five years, that will go into double-digit range. So you look at it adding a couple percent per year based on a low base we're starting because of our high historical cost basis and not cost basis, but the depletion we've got rates in the Permian, but we should see pretty significant improvement, given the high rates of return these wells are generating over the next four or five years.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","And that's basically a $50, $55 casing...","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah. That's right.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Perfect. That's super-helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wanted to follow up on a couple points from your comments. First on the management incentives, I think you mentioned that you already have a lot of the management incentives geared towards corporate returns and per-share growth. Can you just add any more color on whether any of the incentives internally or the weighting towards those incentives are changing or if it is simply a publication and a proxy of what's already in existence today?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, that's a great question. Internally, of course, we look at every variable. And some of them are intertwined, right? It depends on how \u2013 your finding cost ends up touching your DD&A rates and so on. But the fact is \u2013 and actually \u2013 and your capital spending affects your debt numbers as well. So a lot of these goals are intertwined. But as you -if you look at our incentives, we look at all those every year. The one thing we'll have to do when it comes to a proxy is we put a return metric in the proxy which we do not have today. We will revamp the weightings in the proxy. But that's as yet undefined because we haven't had that resolved yet with our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, which will be a topic at the November Board meeting. But by definition of adding a return metric in there, we will be revamping the percentages.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is back to the casing and the 75% of wells currently using the four-string and that number falling. You highlighted the Lower Spraberry and Jo Mill is taking a greater weighting. I just wanted to also see if there was any shifts in the weighting towards the Southern Wolfcamp area or whether it was just simply shallower zones within Midland and Martin County?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Brian, we don't see any change in the Southern acreage. We see that's still going forward as 100% three-string.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And also, are you changing your shift of POP mix or number of wells that you're drilling in the Southern area?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, we still look -- we still are planning to run four rigs in the Southern acreage.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Timothy L.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal H. Shah - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim will be up first. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2018, a strong quarter of execution for Pioneer, and our latest outlook for the remainder of the year.","After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin, including our recent successful Stackberry appraisal results.","Rich will then update you on our firm transportation commitments to move oil from the Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we are receiving.

After that, we will open up the call for your questions. Thank you.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks a lot, Neal. On any objective measure, the third quarter was an exceptionally strong quarter for Pioneer. We substantially beat consensus on earnings and EBITDA. And cash flow for the quarter exceeded our capital spending, all of which are huge positives for PXD.","Earnings were very robust at $355 million on an adjusted basis or $2.07 per diluted share.","Total Permian production met the top-end of the range that we had provided for the quarter. And importantly, Permian oil production exceeded the top-end of the range, growing by 7% quarter over quarter.","Due to that exceptionally strong execution during the quarter, the number of wells that we put on production exceeded our estimates, where we placed 69 horizontal wells on production. And as a result, the balance sheet remains very strong with significant cash on hand and very low debt statistics. And in fact, net debt was reduced by $200 million this year \u2013 this quarter on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Turning to slide 4. The company continues to benefit from its long-term planning approach and particularly regarding our FT program for oil deliveries to the high priced Gulf Coast and export markets. And for the quarter, that benefit resulted in about $200 million of incremental cash flow for the third quarter.","The number is expected to come down to about $125 million in the fourth quarter. That's simply a product of the differentials having tightened in the fourth quarter as compared to those numbers in the third quarter.","We're still continuing to deliver quite a large volume of oil to the Gulf Coast, about 165,000 BOE a day \u2013 or barrels of oil per day in the third quarter under those same FT contracts. And about 130,000 BOPD were exported.","Those numbers will be increasing. In fact, our FT capacity goes up beginning of November to 185,000 barrels of oil per day and over 200,000 [BOPD] in early 2019. So this will become an even bigger part of our results as we move forward. And we continue to see the benefits of incremental pricing as a result.","One of the things we've then seen is that about 90% of these volumes \u2013 over 90% of our volumes will be on FT contracts. And those receive Brent-related pricing, so that's a tremendous positive for the company.","And as we discussed on our last call for the second quarter, we have no exposure today for Midland oil pricing through 2020. That kicked in really in September.","Similarly on natural gas, the company has benefited greatly from FT to western markets, where we receive an uplift of about $1 per Mcf versus that as if we had left the gas into Waha, into Waha sales areas for the whole third quarter.","And from an operational standpoint, Joey will cover this in a lot more detail, but the results look very promising for our first Stackberry pad. You may recall we're drilling a total of three sets of these pads, the first of which we're reporting on today.","The objective of course is to determine how to optimally space and stagger and sequence the Middle Spraberry Shales, the Jo Mill, and the Lower Spraberry Shale intervals for longer-term development. Of course we've drilled wells in all these zones, and they've been excellent wells. And now we're proving we can drill even better wells as we stagger and space these properly.","The idea is to continue to add significant returns as we incrementally go into development mode on the wells. And we're not facing, as a result, any sort of parent\/child issues. In fact, to the contrary, we're actually making better wells.","So the idea here is to not be drilling wells in a situation where we're just simply adding low return downspace wells that essentially over capitalize a given rock volume. We're focused on incremental high returns on each individual well.","Going to slide 5 then. As we reported in the second quarter call, we will soon add two rigs in December that are focused really more or less on 2019 production impact, since we're just coming here at the end of the year. For this year 2018, we still expect the POP range to be 250 to 275 wells.","Margins look very strong. The IRRs continue to be at very high levels, especially when you consider the FT uplifts that I mentioned a minute ago.","We're still on track to place 60 Version 3.0+ wells online for the second half of this year. Fortunately, we completed 44 of those and placed 39 of them on production in the third quarter. Joey will show you more details on that. But the results look really phenomenal, as we have gotten to a point, we think we've reached an optimal place when it comes to these high volume completions.","We also reported in mid-September that we've entered into a long-term West Texas supply agreement for sand with U.S. Silica. It'll represent 30% to 40% of our sand supplies when this kicks in in the first quarter of 2019, at roughly half the cost of our average current supply of sand. As we continue to look at the benefits of reducing sand costs, you can have very dramatic improvements on our well economics, as we drop the cost of those wells related to the sand volumes.","Then going to slide 6, as an update on the divestiture process. We're pleased to have announced that we closed on several sales earlier this year. But we've also most recently, a week ago, announced the signing of a purchase and sale agreement regarding our remaining South Texas oil assets \u2013 we refer to them as the Sinor Nest assets \u2013 for a net $132 million. That should close in the first half of December. We continue to make progress on the divestiture of our remaining Eagle Ford assets as well.","The 2018 capital program remains at about $3.4 billion. In essence what that is, is spending our operating cash flow. So $3.4 billion is the current estimate of our operating cash flow for this year. And that will also be funded if needed from asset divestitures. But in other words, we expect 2018, for in a year's sense, to be essentially cash flow neutral at year end, which is a great step in the right direction.","And 2018 production trajectory looks essentially the same as it has been, which is in the 19% to 24% range, trending towards the upper half of that range.","For the first time, we're talking about our returns on capital employed. You will see in this slide here that we're focusing on an ROCE number expected to be above 10% for the year. That was about 4% last year. What this is, is reflecting the impact of our high return D&C program. We have very high returns at the drilling and completion level, and those then positively impact the bottom line. It's what you would expect.","Also on a per share basis, the company reporting very strong numbers. And we're not issuing shares in connection with large transactions that basically dilute your per share metric. So our per share metrics will be exceedingly strong. Our ROCE will be exceedingly strong as well for 2018.","Finally, on the rainbow chart to the bottom right, this is something we've had in for maybe a decade or so. But we've now adjusted this to be Brent oil price-related. We are now essentially a Brent-priced company, if you talk about our oil sales. And so the rainbow chart has been adjusted to reflect Brent as being the key oil price sensitivity. So just make a note of that for the future.","Now going to slide 7. Production growth remains on a continuing positive trajectory. You can see that our fourth quarter guidance is shown in the right-most column for 2018, 293,000 BOE to 303,000 BOE out of Permian with oil production 188,000 BOE to 194,000 BOE. Just a continuation of the same sort of execution and growth that we have seen over multiple quarters now, and as we continue on track with 1 million [BOE] in 10 [years] goal for the future.","What I'm going to do now is pass it over to Joey. He'll give you some information on the Stackberry well results and an update on the results from our 3.0+ completion campaign for this year.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","All right. Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everybody. I'm going to be picking it up on slide number 8.","And as Tim has already mentioned, our first Stackberry appraisal pad did come on line in the third quarter and is showing strong early time results. Our goal in these tests is to understand how the Spraberry zones interact with each other in full development. We're basically combining our experience from nearly 1,200 wells completed to date with a complex reservoir model that we're developing using cutting-edge science and technology, as you can see illustrated there on the bottom left.","After 90 days on production, we've seen outperformance of approximately 35% over previous Spraberry wells across all three benches in the same area. And now we're going on to gain invaluable knowledge on spacing, staggering, sequencing, and stimulation of these Spraberry zones.","Needless to say, we're extremely pleased with these early time results. And this one test alone has de-risked approximately 50,000 surrounding acres, which allows us to transition the Spraberry intervals into our development plan with confidence.","Now I'm going to be moving on to slide number 9, where you'll see a summary of the Version 3.0+ completion results. The graph on the left represents every Version 3.0+ completion POP through Q3. And we've compared them to Version 3.0 wells in similar areas across the formations.","You'll note the strong cumulative production outperformance to date of approximately 35% for the 3.0+ completions. And now the histogram in the bottom right shows the growth in the number of unique completion designs we've had over the past several years. As you can see, we've more than quadrupled the number of designs that we pump.","As an example, there are roughly 15 unique designs associated with Version 3.0+ alone. Our acreage is larger than the state of Connecticut. And it has a diverse geology over multiple horizons. And as I've stated many times in the past, one size definitely does not fit all. And that makes it impossible for us to identify our completions in just a few buckets.","Bottom line, we're focused on maximizing rate of return, and that requires a wide variety of completion designs. Overall, a very strong execution quarter for the Permian team.","And now I'll pass it on to Rich to discuss marketing.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Joey. I'm going to start on slide 10, where you can see that Pioneer's oil marketing efforts were a key differentiator for the quarter and significantly improved our cash flow for the quarter. Specifically, the barrels that we purchased at the Midland Tank Farm and transported via our FT contracts to the Gulf Coast led to incremental cash flow of $189 million.","Looking at this on a per-barrel basis, our Gulf Coast sales was over $17 per barrel higher than the Midland prices that were in the mid-$50s.","As we look at the fourth quarter, we're expecting a cash flow uplift, as Tim talked about, related to our FT of over $125 million. It's also worth reiterating what Tim mentioned, that in November, our volumes that we transport to the Gulf Coast increased to 185,000 barrels a day from 165,000 barrels a day, and will increase in January to 200,000 barrels per day. All of these barrels are expected to receive Brent-related pricing, increasing the company's cash flow and overall cash margins.","Related to that, the company has derivatives in place now for 25,000 barrels a day of 2019 production that are tied to Brent prices. And future derivatives will also be tied to Brent prices.","Turning to slide 11 and looking at Q3 earnings. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $411 million or $2.39 per diluted share. It did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative gains of $38 million. And unusual items listed here really related to our asset divestitures, and that included a gain on the West Panhandle sale of $114 million after tax, offset by other related charges, which principally related to expensing future pipeline commitment fees related to our Raton divestiture.","So adjusting for those unusual items, we were at $355 million or $2.07 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show Q3 guidance relative to results. You can see that all of the items are within guidance or on the positive side of guidance for the quarter. So overall, an excellent quarter for the company.","Turning to slide 12, looking at price realizations. As you can see there looking at the oil bar that oil prices for the quarter were up, including the benefits of FT contracts, by 5%. Without that benefit, and just subject to Midland pricing, we would have been down 6%. So once again, the benefit of our FT contracts.","If you look at NGLs, NGL prices were up 25% quarter-over-quarter, really reflecting the significant improvement in ethane and propane prices for the quarter. Gas prices were up 12% to $2.21 per Mcf, reflecting the benefit of moving 70% of our gas out to the Southern California markets, where it's priced on the SoCal Index. And that netted an extra dollar per Mcf relative to Waha prices in the Midland Basin.","So overall, you can see that our marketing strategy of moving our products to higher priced markets is significantly increasing cash flows and providing improved margins.","Turning to slide 13 on production costs. You can see for the quarter that they were down $1 per BOE relative to the second quarter, or 9%. This decrease is principally related to the sale of our Raton and West Panhandle assets that had higher production costs. And that's reflected in the lower price per BOE \u2013 or production cost per BOE.","Turning to slide 14. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity. As Tim mentioned, our net debt for the quarter was down $200 million relative to the second quarter. We have no near-term maturities and really are in an excellent financial position.","Turning to slide 15, Q4 guidance. A production forecast of 293,000 BOEs per day to 303,000 BOEs per day. And really if you look at the rest of the information here, that guidance is similar to prior quarter, so I won't go through that. But in summary, we had really an excellent quarter, as Tim mentioned, and we're on our way to a very strong fourth quarter.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Rich. And as we've discussed today, we really have had an outstanding third quarter. And we expect this momentum to continue through the fourth quarter and into 2019. It's really too early to discuss our 2019 production and capital in detail. But the roadmap for 2019 will be to continue to prosecute the 1 million [BOE] in 10 [years] plan, just as shown on the slide number 16.","We'll continue to make decisions in the best interests of our stakeholders, where we drive down costs, emphasize returns, focus on capital discipline, and take steps to more meaningfully return capital to shareholders in the next few months.","We are, in fact, working on a number of specific initiatives that we'll be announcing over the next few months that will result in material capital savings and decreased well costs going forward. You can look for some of those announcements to come in the next few weeks.","We expect that our capital budget for 2019 will come in at a point where it's below our operating cash flow. And therefore, we expect that we will generate free cash flow in 2019. We plan to have a full update on all of this in February, as has been our practice in the past. It'll be during our fourth quarter call in early February.","And with that, we'd like, Greg, for you to open up the call for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, sir. At this time, we will pause for just a moment. And first with Citi, we have Bob Morris.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good quarter, gentlemen. First question is, Joey, with the cost inflation that you noted last quarter, are the Version 3.0+ well completions still running at around $9 million all-in?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, the incremental cost of a Version 3.0+ completion compared to our standard completion is $1 million. And I don't know that I could actually create one bucket that explains what all of our well costs are, because it varies across the Lower Spraberry, Jo Mill, Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B, and also by geographic area. But in essence, the Version 3.0+ completion still costs about $1 million more per well.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then separately, last quarter you mentioned that the higher line pressure on Targa would impact production in Q3 by 2,000 BOE to 3,000 BOE per day. Did that end up actually being the case? And as we look at Q4, if so, is that something that's been resolved? That you'll get that incremental production back here in Q4? Or how did that play out?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think \u2013 are you talking about \u2013 Bob, are you talking about the new plant addition, dropping the line pressure?","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes.","(20:36)","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You mentioned it might impact Q3 production by 2 MBOE to 3 MBOE per day. And I didn't see any comment or reference to that in this release.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I didn't know if that ended up happening or not.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah. That's exactly right. We didn't put it in because, just in the interest of time. But the plant did start receiving gas, the plant in question, and is a Targa-related facility the last week in September. And it has significantly reduced line pressures in the area, which is a huge positive on all of our flow rates.","And I think from that standpoint, we'll continue to see the benefits of that as we get through the fourth quarter.","The next Targa facility comes online in late February. Actually in the winter period of time, there's less issues related to line pressure, simply because we use gas for the heater treater systems to make sure the oil is flowing in the colder weather period.","So we think we're in good shape. The next plant comes on, as I said, in late February. We'll continue to see the benefits of lower line pressures.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. That's great. Again, good quarter. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Next up, we have Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Tim, I wonder if I could pick up on your last comment about generating free cash flow in 2019. The hedge book right now looks fairly light. I'm just curious if you can put some caveats around that in terms of your commodity assumptions? And given your balance sheet strength, how would you think about the use of free cash as you go forward? Because it does look like you're getting pretty close to an inflection point.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well I think we clearly are. The way I would catch it, Doug, we're sort of at an inflection point this quarter. This is a quarter where we actually generated free cash flow. So I think 2019 from an annual standpoint will certainly be that same situation.","Our assumptions in terms of when we refer to our current view of the budget in terms of capital and the resulting aspects of production growth and cash flow generation are based on high-60s Brent. Of course, depending upon what your view on the WTI\/Brent differential, what those views are, it could be low 60s WTI or to mid-60s WTI. And from that standpoint, we think that's a reasonable price basis to go into looking at a budgeting cycle.","Now of course, we are relatively lowly hedged in 2019 compared to 2018. So we will be susceptible to lower prices if they were to occur. But by the same token, we have much more exposure to upward pricing as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm just curious, do you plan on \u2013 normally you would go into the year significantly more hedged than you are today on a rolling basis. Would you plan to step-up the hedging exposure between now and, let's say, the turn of the year?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think that's just a reflection of price. I mean if we feel like there's opportunity presented by much higher prices than we see today. You have basically a flat curve today, through 2019. So there's not a tremendous benefit above where prices are today in terms of looking out and hedging into the future.","I think we'd hold off at these kind of prices and not do much hedging. If there's an opportunity to hedge substantially higher than where we are and guarantee a significant amount of free cash flow generation, we certainly would look at it. So we're going to be flexible.","You asked the other question regarding what to do with the cash. That's something of course that we'll be looking at over the next few months. And we'll have some decisions to be made in that regard. But as I said, it's pretty clear that one of the things we're going to be doing is evaluating steps to more meaningfully return capital to shareholders.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And I'm wondering if I could have a quick follow-up with Joey, just on the Stackberry result. Joey, if I'm looking at the chart correctly, it looks to us at least that the Stackberry initial wells are at least as good as the Version 3 Wolfcamp wells.","So I'm just wondering, how do you think about layering this into your development options, as to how you move the program forward, now that you appear to be well on your way to de-risking that inventory?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, as we stated in the \u2013 as I stated in my comments and as I stated in the slide, this basically de-risks 50,000 acres in that one particular area. And then we've \u2013 of course we have two more tests coming online. We have one that came online in October. And we're watching those results. And then we'll have another one that'll come on line here in late November. And we'll be taking that all into account.","I think it's, there's no doubt that what this does is give us confidence that we can start placing these Stackberry wells into our development plan. But I would characterize it very similarly to how I do the Wolfcamp D and other appraisals that we do.","We have such a vast array of acreage. It gives us confidence that we can start looking at how we time it and how we put it in. But how we're going to start bringing it into 2019 is still up in the air. But it gives us confidence that we can put it in at any time in this particular area. And then we'll be too early to tell on the other two areas.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great stuff. Thanks. And let me just say I think you've drawn a line under a lot of the execution concerns of the past year, so congratulations on a great quarter.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Doug. Appreciate that.","Operator","Moving on, from Raymond and James (sic) [Raymond James] (25:55), we have John Freeman.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Morning, Freeman.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","When I look at slide 9, I guess for, maybe first for Joey. With the significant number of the different completion designs, should we expect kind of as you learn more and more about all the various zones and the testing that you're doing that you all have highlighted, that that trend sort of continues, where we get more and more of these sort of discrete completion designs? And I'm just kind of curious when you're kind of \u2013 when you all are formulating your budget, does it create like a meaningful range of \u2013 or wider range of outcomes on sort of well costs and things like that?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, there's no doubt. My team is celebrating today the death of the Version 3.0+ and Version 3.0 taglines, because you can see we have 45 different completions. And even on 3.0+, we have 15 different versions of that.","And to answer your question, absolutely. Every one of those \u2013 and I think that this kind of illustrates the point. Every one of those has a different cost. Every one of those has a different result. And what we're trying to zero in on is return.","So as I look at the 2019 budget formulation, absolutely. You see various different completion recipes all throughout that plan, all with different cost. And again, we're focusing on capital efficiency and maximizing return. So yes, it does add to what the plans look like going forward and multiple different scenarios.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then, Tim, obviously just following up a little bit on your comments regarding certain steps on returning capital to shareholders will be forthcoming. And I'm just trying to \u2013 I guess from a thought process, in the past you've kind of talked about, really that's something that you wanted to think about more when you sort of reach the point of generating sort of excess cash flow from just operations.","But I'm curious if either the recent divestitures and sort of the upcoming divestitures, if kind of the combination and the proceeds from those and then just the massive cash balance, if I'm sort of thinking about it the right way, where you could potentially use that to sort of jump start some of those plans to kind of bridge the gap before you get to significant excess cash flow from just operations.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's a great question, John. I think the way I look at it, we've got an arsenal of ways to deal with this question, both with regard to cash on hand prior to divestitures to divestitures to, as you stated, a free cash flow generative model in 2019. Those are all tremendous weapons to use at our benefit to try to solve for what's the optimal amount and the correct amount of return of capital to shareholders. And that's exactly what we'll be doing.","It is important I think from a fundamental standpoint that we actually get this company to where we are, in fact, generating free cash flow. I think that's 2019. That's the point at which we have always said we're going to be evaluating this in a more significant way. And that's our messaging today.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Very nice quarter. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question will come from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. Tim, I wanted to get your thoughts on kind of the future of vertical integration at Pioneer. We've seen the company make some steps recently, including the U.S. Silica deal. And I know you're using a couple maybe third-party fleets.","But how do you think about vertical integration over the 10 year? And I was wondering if you also could just elaborate on your commentary about some initiatives that you have under place, maybe to improve the capital efficiency that you talked about in your prepared comments.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, sure, A.J. First of all, our objectives when we look at these initiatives are really twofold. And those are to make sure we're very competitive in the sense of future costs on wells and our whole D&C program. And there's various initiatives that are required in order for us to do so. One of which you've seen us accomplish at least to some extent already in the U.S. Silica transaction I mentioned.","Now the other though is to look at areas where we have capital going out the door that would have to be reconsidered or at least thought of differently perhaps in a world where we're trying to reduce capital spending. And so without going into a lot of detail, those are a couple of the initiatives we're trying to do. The 100% focus of course is improving our capital efficiency through time and making sure that we are in fact the low-cost producer.","Now when it comes to vertical integration, this is something companies like ours who have invested in vertical integration have to assess from time to time. As we look at an increasing rig count, going into the future of course, that's coupled with the increasing needs for frac fleets. We have to assess now whether we're going to invest in ourselves or whether we're going to use third-parties for that kind of a future investment. So those are the type of things we're looking at today.","Without any more detail, but we'll be announcing some initiatives in regard to various ways to cut costs and reduce capital spending over the next few weeks.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just my follow-up, Tim, lots of questions on your plans to return cash to shareholders. You do have quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet. Our question is, you do have some investments in midstream, thinking about your JV and your gas processing plus the water system. What are your thoughts about potentially on a longer term basis monetizing these midstream investing \u2013 investments and returning cash to shareholders through this avenue?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think if you look at gas prices, I mean we've been very pleased to have a seat at the table with our equity interest over multiple years with Targa, our partner. And that's allowed us to make sure we can keep ahead of what's going on in terms of gas production","The base \u2013 considering we're just one of the many producers which move gas through that system. In fact, we're about, in a given day, 35% to 40% of the throughput volume. So we're also speaking for the other 60% in terms of what growth rates look like to make sure that the capacity is in fact there. So that's been an important investment for us.","The water system is something that I would consider to be still under development. In fact, we are moving dirt and we are in the process of moving forward vis-a-vis our Midland water plant investment. Of course, that's going to take some time. We won't see first water from that until let's say the end of 2020 or so.","But at the time it comes on, it'll be 240,000 barrels a day of effluent water and will quickly move us to a point where we will not be utilizing any significant amount of freshwater. And that's substantial looking forward, in terms of making sure that we have the water capabilities to provide for that component of our capital needs to move our program forward.","That said, we'll evaluate these decisions as these processes move forward. Obviously today, water is really early from the standpoint we're just in the process of building new facilities.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Next, we have Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Maybe a quick follow-up on the midstream as you're speaking of that. I know you don't have official guidance for capital in 2019. But as we think about 2019 and maybe 2020 or just over the next couple years, is there any meaningful change in the amount of capital expected to be spent on infrastructure, as we look forward over the next couple years?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well I think if you look at midstream, for instance, the needs for gas processing will go up simply as a matter of the production of oil going up in the basin. And toward that end, I'm familiar with Targa's plans for 2019, which incorporate a couple new plants as well as another plant \u2013 or two to three plants, one might be in the early 2020 timeframe. And so there will be continuing capital required in that business, yes.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thanks. And then I appreciate the commentary on a couple of additional rigs to be added in December. How should we think about the potential pace and cadence of rig additions in 2019? I know you don't have guidance. But in the past, you've kind of given us rule of thumbs at times in terms of pace of rig additions. And maybe any rough estimate on what POPs could look like in 2019 relative to 2018?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","We're not going to be able to get into that level of detail, Ryan, until we establish it internally. We're still working on that.","I mean the fact is, with more rigs will come more POPs. You can think of it somewhat ratably. Now what's happened recently is our level of efficiency of drilling and completions has gone up so dramatically that we have to assess that in our planning and decide exactly how that impacts the need for rigs.","I mean certainly, in the models we've shown you in the past, we add a few rigs per year. I think what we'll try to do to deal with the 2019 program is to have a full year plan, such that we probably would make sure we incorporated any rigs in calendar year 2019 that would be effective only in 2020. In other words, rigs added in 2019 that would then affect 2020 production, we would put in the 2019 capital budget. So that will be one change you see us do.","Ryan Todd - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it.","Operator","Next, we have Paul Sankey with Mizuho.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Tim, you mentioned that \u2013 well, overall in the past, you've said that as you rise through your rainbow chart, as you call it, spending would go up with the oil price. It feels like with this result, as you mentioned, you have an inflection point, that we're reaching a terminal level of spending and rigs. I think that's what I heard in the previous answer as well.","Am I thinking about that the right way? Which is to say, if the oil price was to go higher from here, you wouldn't be adding rigs and spending, given the performance that you're seeing from the existing activities that you've got? And given that you're essentially on track with your long-term target?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Paul, just to clarify, our long-term plan does envision us adding rigs through time, because it's necessary to offset what, in effect, becomes a larger base of declining wells through time.","But what we've said in the past, just to clarify, is that we're not going to accelerate activity in the face of higher prices. It doesn't make any sense, because usually associated with higher prices come higher costs. And so therefore, the last thing we want to do is accelerate into a declining margin scenario.","So I think what you'll do is see us stick to our knitting in terms of executing our plan. Price has become somewhat of an exogenous factor. And we'll be doing that through multiple years ahead. It's part of our 1 million [BOE] in 10 [years] plan.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Right. So the increased CapEx that you've seen this year has essentially not been related to the higher oil price?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I mean, yeah. The higher oil price did have an effect on us, Paul, which we were very clear on last quarter, which has to do with we were in a different cost environment as a result of higher prices.","And so what has affected us more in 2018 is just reflective of the fact that prices were higher but not a difference in activity. We have added some rigs here, as I mentioned in my prepared commentary, at the end of December to prepare for, in essence, what amounts to 2019 production growth. And that's been well documented.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Understood. And then you're sort of walking away a little bit from just using the catch-all Version 3 description. But how is the performance of these multiple different techniques that you're using differing now? And if you could just expand on that, if you like, in terms of how we think about the future performance of these wells? Thank you.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think I'll let Joey answer that, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Thank you.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Paul, I mean just to be clear, where we try these Version 3.0+ completions, they're in areas where we have a high confidence that they'll be successful, based on our extensive understanding of the 1,200 wells that we've put on to date.","But by no stretch of the imagination are we suggesting that Version 3.0+ completions work everywhere in every instance. And we don't execute our plan that way.","That's part of the reason why we're trying to go away from that. Because the nuances of the completions just make it so much more difficult to put them into buckets.","But in the areas where they do work, we're still seeing that they are yielding great, promising results. But again, we're just focused on putting the right completion to maximize our returns. And that's what we're focused on going forward.","It's very similar to the Stackberry and how we see that. It's we've proven the concept. It goes into our war chest. And then we're looking at putting together the best program we can each year that maximizes the returns.","And so the deployment of Version 3.0+ wells in conjunction with where we can do some Stackberry tests and all these things, the more we prove these things up, the more optionality we have, which allows us to leverage our infrastructure and our tank batteries and our water so that we can put together the most capitally efficient program we possibly can.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Moving on, we have Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Morning, Tim, to you and your whole team there.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask about the Stackberry test. And really the two that \u2013 I guess the one that's flowing back now and the one that'll soon be flowing back.","This first one was in western Martin. And looking at the rough map, it looks like you de-risked about a five-mile radius around that test. Can you talk about where the next two tests are going to be geographically? And whether we should \u2013 whether that's the right template to use, about kind of a five-mile radius of de-risking? Or at some point, will it be the case that you've done these in enough different kind of spots across your asset, your footprint there, that you can say, hey, we're de-risking a lot more of that.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Charles, so the one that we put online this past month was in Midland County, kind of central Midland County. And then the one that we'll putting online here not too long from now is in Southern Martin County.","And to answer your question, I don't know that it's exact, but I would say general range of magnitude that, yes, we would expect that both these two tests would help us de-risk a similar amount of acreage as the one that we are currently describing, which is in Scharbauer Ranch.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Joey. Thank you. And then, Tim, perhaps this question might be best for you. You've got a lot of questions about things that \u2013 assets that you'd be looking to divest that are maybe outside of the core E&P operations.","But when I think back over your trajectory in the last few years, one of the things that's really differentiated Pioneer from other operators is that you guys have been out in front in identifying pinch points that may emerge and addressing those. And you could see this happen with water, with sand. You can make an argument that that's been the case as well with midstream and pressure pumping.","So while it makes sense that at some point, these investments mature and you want to move them on to different hands, are there other investments that you can talk about that you guys are considering that might not be on our radar now, but could be solving a problem that's going to materialize two years down the line for you?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think if you look at the things that are currently at issue, the ones that have been well documented are clear. And in particular, we're talking about what's happened with pipeline limitations from the Permian oil, in particular, and gas.","Gas of course gets mitigated somewhat as we get into the fourth quarter of next year, as the new pipeline to Agua Dulce comes on stream. Similarly on oil, you got the three new pipelines coming on to Corpus [Christi]. That gets solved.","Today, for example, basically frac space at Mont Belvieu is relatively tight. I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Then there will be some expansions early next year, so that gets solved.","I think longer term, one pinch point that I think the industry is going to have to deal with is making sure we're prepared with electric transmission to make sure that we're in good shape on electricity supply. Right now, I think that's really not a pinch point. But it's we have to keep vigilant on, mostly because it's not something we control. It's controlled by the PUC, the State of Texas, ERCOT, and our energy suppliers.","So that's one thing that doesn't get much air time, but nonetheless is something which we have to make sure we're focused on and continued, like our other businesses, to be planning long term.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thank you, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Next, we have Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Couple things to follow-up on. Maybe first on the marketing side, obviously we've got some movement in differentials. And that's expected to narrow out next year. But at the same time you guys are ramping barrels that are going to be moving to the coast.","Just curious if you'd be willing to provide some kind of broad strokes around what you think that marketing income might look like over the course of 2019? Or maybe directionally how it looks relative to the fourth quarter run rate? Any color you're willing to provide.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Michael, I'd say that when you look at the forward curves is probably the easiest way to look at it. And look at where the Brent\/WTI differential is, which is running right around $9 to $10 recently for 2019. So I think that gives you an indication of one piece of it.","Then if you look at the Midland differential relative to WTI, that varies next year from, call it, $5 down to about $2, so put it in that $3 range. So all-in, you're looking at $12. And our cost to do that is about $6 to \u2013 all-in from there. So that's kind of the differential. And you can kind of do the math then of what that would mean from an uplift that the company would receive over Midland pricing.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And what total amount of volume can you move next year do you think through all these contracts?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think it starts at 200,000 [barrels] a day, and grows probably to 225,000 [barrels] or so by the end of the year.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the NGL realization side, sorry if I missed any questions on this, I dropped for a minute. But you had very strong realizations, some of the best we've seen I think in the quarter. Is that sustainable relative to maybe a blended [Mont] Belvieu barrel or relative to WTI, however you want to think about it? Is that a kind of sustainable run rate you think? Or, yeah, any thoughts on that going forward?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, I don't think it's sustainable, only because of what's happened with NGL prices since the end of the quarter. I mean if you look at what's happened in October, ethane prices, propane prices, and really the whole wide grade barrel has fallen. And so that was really a product of where commodity prices were during the third quarter that we benefited from and will still be getting market prices for our NGL barrels in Mont Belvieu for the fourth quarter. And so they'll reflect a lower forward curve.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Understood. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Moving on, from TPH, we have Matt Portillo.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, all.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just one question for me. Tim, given your peer leading inventory depth and focused on a modest pace of development going forward, is there the potential at some point to look at a carve off of longer dated inventory? Potentially bring additional cash in the door and hopefully closing the gap on the deep, deep discount of the intrinsic value of your shares?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, great question, Matt. It's certainly something that we have as a top of mind issue. For the time being, I think our main objective is to evaluate our whole acreage position. Just like any acreage position in inventory, we have some areas that won't come with a premium in the sense of it's where it stacks up and when it's going to get drilled. So we have some acreage, some of our areas that just won't compete relative to some of our core of the core acreage.","And so we're actually doing an inventorying of all this acreage from an economic standpoint. And certainly going to begin the process by looking at that acreage which won't make the cut from an economic standpoint, using any kind of reasonable set of assumptions. And that's being done by our business development team as we speak. So you can expect that we'll have a goal set for 2019 to divest of certain assets that we think won't make the cut.","After that, everything else is under consideration, realizing we do have quite a long inventory in terms of really measured in decades. We've got to assess exactly what the next steps are in that regard.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, from SunTrust, we have Neal Dingmann.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Tim, you mentioned this several times on the call. You guys obviously are outstanding on the financial side. My thought, and I've had some questions just with people asking about on the gas processing side. You obviously have a large facility there. I know I've talked to Neal about this in the past, about just your thoughts about what to do with that. I mean do you continue building that up? Do you monetize? How do you think about that facility, given sort of the success you've had with monetizations, other things like that in the past?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, Neal, I think that this has been quite an outstanding partnership between Pioneer and Targa, which has allowed us to keep ahead of gas processing requirements in the basin. And again not just ours, but others as well.","Plants will need to continue to be built. So we've got to make assessments as to whether we want to continue investing in those. And that's simply going to be a decision we make going forward. So I think certainly it's been a good set of investments for us. We have to assess that as we go forward.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, Tim, looking at slide 21. Obviously your FT is \u2013 there's nobody second to you all right now in this. The exports continue to climb.","How do you sort of mix \u2013 I know you mentioned now in that earlier slide, you're now relating that to Brent. But I guess my overall question is, will exports kind of continue to become a larger and larger piece of the business? Or how do you sort of view when you start sort of diversifying your takeaway?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think the fact is, with the Permian Basin growing as fast as it is, and that being all, relatively speaking, light sweet crude oil, there really is no alternative for the entire industry other than to export. We're going to satiate U.S. refining capacity demand for this type of oil, even though there are a couple of expansions under way, within a relatively short period of type based on that growth rate.","The industry has no choice but to export these volumes as a result. We just happen to be at the forefront of being prepared for this. And are taking advantage of it with, as Rich mentioned, at a point where we have 200,000 barrels a day being exported. That's a substantial amount of world oil demand being met by Pioneer's individual net volumes.","That said, the very \u2013 the big positive about this is we're seeing that this oil is in good demand in the world markets, in particular this light sweet brand of crude oil, works in a world where we're trying to reduce sulfur content in motor fuels and in maritime-related fuels. So it's right down the alley of some of the big refining centers.","Right now, because of what's going on in Asia, we're probably balanced more 60% to Europe, 40% to Asia. Prior to the issues with Chinese trade, we probably were more in the other side of the coin, 40%\/60% in terms of 60% going to Asia. But we'll always find that there's opportunities in the world to take this oil. Furthermore, everyone would prefer to take U.S. oil supply versus countries for which there's a lot more political risk.","So we're seeing dramatic increases in demand. And that's where this oil is going. So we're at the forefront of that, really a major industry player now when it comes to the market for this type of oil.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Well, congrats, Tim, and props to your marketing team. They've done an exceptional job.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I will tell them you said that. Thanks.","Operator","And next, we have Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all, and congrats on a great quarter and update.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perhaps for Joey. Referencing page 9 of your PowerPoint and the bottom right chart specifically, if you were to speak to one interval only, how many unique completion designs would you have across your position?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Oh, just to one interval only? I don't know that it would \u2013 well, it would be slightly different. But I would say just in the Wolfcamp B, and I'm just purely guessing here, you're still going to have 20-plus.","Sometimes whenever you go to the Lower Spraberry Shale and things \u2013 or intervals like that, we've discovered stage length isn't as much of a driver as it is in other areas. So there are some things that are distinct between intervals. But even across Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A, we have a wide variety of completion designs.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Very...","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So I think the answer to the question is, there's really \u2013 it's not one-size-fits-all even by interval.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. And then as my follow-up, perhaps for Tim. There's been a lot of discussion this quarter on efforts across the industry, to optimize spacing and minimize detrimental parent\/child relationships.","You guys are clearly more conservative than most of your peers with spacing in the Wolfcamp. But you also have materially more inventory than your peers. If your position were 100,000 acres or less, would your development approach still be biased towards 750-foot spacing or wider in the Wolfcamp?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Derrick, this is the best question I've gotten in a long time, because it shows some insight into what's going on in the industry.","I wouldn't call us conservative. I would call us value optimizing. I would call us maximizing economics. What I mean by that, and I referred to this a little bit in my earlier commentary, if you don't have enough inventory, what you do is you basically drill the hell out of it. And you basically drill so many wells to \u2013 and the concept being, we're going to drill one more well to squeak out one more dollar of NPV, because that's the only alternative we have when we have limited acreage. And what that means is the last \u2013 the economics on the last well drilled are lousy.","We're taking the opposite view. We want the economics on every single well to be very, very strong. We stop when we start seeing degrading of economics on a per-well basis. We don't care about maximizing NPV per section, because you're going to drill uneconomic wells to make that happen, relative to our alternatives.","We're blessed with a vast inventory, which really helps us to stop when we start seeing diminishing returns in a section by drilling it too far downspace. So I don't think we're conservative. I think we're the beneficiary of our acreage position.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the detail, Tim. Very helpful.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah.","Operator","And next, we have Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the well costs initiatives that you're taking can you talk about the magnitude that that could bring to reducing well costs and what U.S. Silica does? And when you think about \u2013 or when we should think about what some of the ones that are yet to be announced are, are they more contractual like U.S. Silica? Are they more process driven efficiencies? Or are they initiatives in which you'll actually spend some capital, but you'll get a return on that capital via lower well costs?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, let's just talk about the style of the U.S. Silica deal and what that means. To the extent that we are in effect with that contract delivering sand at about 50% of our alternative today, if you then consider, if that were to be applicable across a broader swath of our sand needs. And let's just say it were to be 100% of our sand needs, it would be saving us $400,000 to $500,000 per well. So I would call that dramatic in its own right.","Some of the other initiatives we're looking at are, on the one hand, intended to give us long-term cost advantages on D&C. And some of them are just related to cutting capital and putting us in a good contractual situation.","I'm going to leave it at that. But suffice it to say all these initiatives are based on improving our economics, improving our returns. And those will be substantial improvements.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then you talked a little bit about just some of the building the pipeline risks. But I guess beyond that, as you prepare for 2019, what do you see as the key areas of potential risk around execution? And what are the mitigation efforts that you and the team are taking now?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think we're well-situated for 2019, Brian. If you look at \u2013 of course we have a much more long-term planning approach. That's what happens when you establish long-term goals.","So every time a team comes in to talk to us about what they're trying to achieve to actually mitigate risks, it's about what are they doing to meet those long-term goals. So we have pipeline space locked up for FT, for both gas, oil, and NGLs that cover us, easily in the case of oil, through early 2021 or 2022. So we'll be working on pipeline deals, but they're not going to affect 2019.","If you look at our water supply today, we move about 500,000 barrels of water to our locations every day. That's because we have a large water system that allows us to do so. We're moving ahead on sand, as we discussed. And you'll probably see some more news on our ability to make sure we can increase those savings as well.","So it's across this whole broad range of initiatives that I can say 2019 is somewhat to the point where we could say, most of the issues, that if we had any, were already mitigated. Realizing we always have three years' worth of wells already scripted in advance.","So there may be issues, or maybe things that could occur. You can't ever rule out bad weather as an example. I mean we've seen that in the past. Right now, we're setting ranges for production that incorporate bad weather potential in our basin. And I think those won't affect us from the standpoint of ability to meet our targets.","But other than that, I feel very good about our execution. And our objective is to take the kind of momentum we've seen here in third quarter, take it into fourth quarter, and take it into 2019. I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to do that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to President and CEO, Tim Dove.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Greg. I appreciate everybody being on the call. I also want to make sure everybody has a great Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is important for the country. It's important for all of our families, and I wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving, and for that matter, holiday season following that.","And we'll be looking forward to giving you some updates in the interim as I said regarding some of these initiatives. And at the same time, we'll really be looking forward to our call in February, where we can outline our 2019 plan.","Thanks, everybody, for being on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal H. Shah - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Selsina. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us.","Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim will be up first; he'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the second quarter of 2018 and our plans for the remainder of the year. He will also highlight our continuing strong course on the well performance in the Permian Basin. After Tim concludes his remarks, Rich will be up and update you on our firm transportation commitments to move oil from Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we're receiving from growing refinery and export sales in this market. Rich will also cover the second quarter financials and provide earnings guidance through the third quarter. After that, we will open up the call for your questions.","Thank you. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Neal, and welcome everybody. This is Neal's first earnings conference call, Frank Hopkins having retired, so we welcome Neal to the team.","We reported another strong quarter of operating and financial results in the second quarter and we're seeing improvements in our drilling and completions efficiency and also our well results look very strong. This is also the first quarter where we've begun to see a very significant positive impact from our FT position on our cash flow. More on that in a minute as we will elaborate some more details on that.","Permian production continues to be strong. After we adjust for certain unanticipated items and the impact of those such as severe weather and high line pressures and an accounting change, adjusted production came in at 177,000 BOE per day and 272,000 BOE per day. Those were essentially at the midpoint of the guidance, as shown. Strong earnings quarter with $243 million of adjusted income, or $1.41 per diluted share.","Overall production when you look at the total for the company, including assets that are essentially in the process of being divested after you adjust for the same items, would have come in at about 320,000 BOE per day or near the top of the guidance range. We did place 67 wells on production in the quarter as some of those were somewhat back-weighted to the last two months.","We continued to have an industry-leading balance sheet and our debt statistics continue to be extremely strong with $1.5 billion of cash on hand and that is after having repaid the senior notes which became due in May of $450 million. We've now repurchased $51 million of our common stock during the first half of the year in association with the program we put in place early in the year.","Turning to slide 4, and then following up on my earlier comments on the positive impacts of our FT position, we did deliver 165,000 barrels of oil a day to the Gulf Coast from the Permian under those FT contracts, and about 103,000 barrels a day were exported. So we're becoming a very significant exporter when it comes to the Permian deliveries to the Gulf Coast. The uplift from those deliveries to the Gulf Coast added about $69 million of incremental cash flow, so this number is getting significant.","But because the contracts are struck two months before the oil lifts, what's happened recently is the Brent\/WTI and Midland\/Cushing differentials were very high and wider in May and June, a little bit less in July, but the point is our third quarter uplift should be significantly higher than the second quarter and we're currently estimating it'll be over $175 million for the third quarter. So we're seeing significant impacts from our FT position in terms of positive cash flow.","If you look at our pricing going forward, the result of that is almost all of our sales to the Gulf Coast will be Brent-related in terms of how they're priced. So 90% of the volume will be going under FT contracts to the Gulf Coast, actually into early 2021 at Brent-related pricing. The balance of the volume is about 10%, will be now priced based on WTI\/Cushing. Now, we executed an option to do that. There had been prior to this point, prior to September, being priced based on Midland prices. We have toggled that to now those are going to be priced based on WTI\/Cushing. So essentially when we're done with that, we'll have no exposure to Midland pricing through the next couple of years, in fact, through 2020.","On the gas side, 70% of our volume as we've reported before is transported to the west and tied to Southern California gas price indices. The balance, the 30% being sold under term contracts at Waha. It did give us an uplift to be able to price the significant amount of gas into the Southern California index market. In fact, about $0.25 per Mcf positive impact compared to had we just had all that volume in Waha. I think the important message for gas is that we don't anticipate any issues in moving our gas volumes moving forward for a few years, especially until we get the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline on in the second half of 2019.","On the well front, we just wanted to point out as an example that we continue to show impressive performance. The example in particular here is the Wolfcamp D. We have the three well pad in the Southern JV area that we put 3.0 completions on these wells. And you can see the numbers are sort of staggering. About a 75% improvement over the early life of these wells compared to the earlier style completions that were done say 3 and 4 years ago in the exact same area. So you can see we're making significant inroads in improving the performance of these wells as we now have more advanced ability in terms of completions.","Turning now to slide 5. For the remainder of the year we plan to add rigs. We're running about 20 rigs any given day today. The plan is to add 4 rigs, couple here shortly and a couple later in the fourth quarter with the idea of beginning to support the 2019 plan. And I think that's going to effectively not impact this year's production as much as it will positively affect next year. We continue then as a result to be in our range of popping 250 to 275 wells this year which is not changing, even with the additional rigs. I can say definitively margins remain very strong. Of course, oil prices are significantly up from where they were a year ago. If you go back and check oil prices this week, one year ago, were $49. So you can see we had substantial improvements as a result of that.","The margins on a cash basis, including the longer-term IRRs are strong, and that is one of the reasons of course we're seeing the opportunity to invest further in more 3.0+ wells. We've actually seen very good results of course on our 45 planned 3.0+ wells in the first half of the year and as a result, we're adding 60 more. Again, related to the fact that margins are quite strong, but also because the improvements that we're seeing from 3.0+ are substantial, as they continue to show significant improved economics from that incremental investment.","I think it's important to watch also the stack bury testing. We've referred to it in the past. We have about 19 wells in three different drilling appraisal programs that will be brought on production in the second half of this year. Now, the idea is to develop the strategy for long-term development of the Middle Spraberry Shale, the Jo Mill and the Lower Spraberry Shale. Of course, what we're trying to figure out here, even though we've drilled excellent wells in all of those zones is the proper sequencing and spacing and staggering of those wells and exactly how to stimulate those as to get optimal capital efficiency in those stacked programs. Actually, the first six of those wells have recently been put online. They're cleaning up as we speak, so you can expect some more color on this as we get through the next couple of months, and in fact on the third quarter call in November.","Now turning to slide 7 (sic) [slide 6], an update regarding our divestiture process. We are fortunate to be able to say we've closed two sales, one being Raton. This is our exit from Colorado after many years being there in the gas business and also having sold selected western Eagle Ford acreage, the total of those of $182 million. We have, as recently announced, signed a purchase and sale agreement to sell the West Panhandle field for a little over $200 million. We expect that closing this quarter.","And then we're still progressing divestiture of the Eagle Ford and other South Texas assets and we hope to have some more news on that as we go forward. But at the end of the process, and I think it will take essentially the balance of all of this year, it will result in Pioneer becoming that pure-play Permian Basin player that we've been talking about. Importantly, it will improve our reported margins, our per-barrel and per-BOE metrics and corporate returns when that's all completed. So it's a work in progress, but it's going well.","As we've also mentioned during the last few months, we're adjusting our capital program for this year to the range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Fundamentally, we believe this capital is well spent based on what I mentioned earlier, which is the strong returns that we're continuing to see at the well level. That will be funded from what has been an increased amount of operating cash flow related to current pricing of about $3.3 billion and part of the proceeds from the asset divestitures I mentioned a minute ago.","The capital budget adjustment is really related to the fact, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to be adding 4 rigs in preparation for 2019, and also the incremental 60 3.0+ completions in the second half, of course, related to the higher pricing environment that we've mentioned, we've all seen in the industry compared to what we set our original budgets at, at the beginning of the year.","In addition, and in particular, we're now seeing the impacts of the steel tariffs flow through and they're affecting, of course, tubulars and other steel products that we use. We can see steel easily compared to last year would be 20% to 25% over last year's cost for the same products. Our overall production continues to be forecasted in this range of 19% to 24%, and we still believe we're trending towards the upper half of that range. I'll give a little bit more color on that in a couple more slides.","Going to slide 7, just a little bit of an update regarding uplifts from 3.0+ completions, just to give you some confidence that we continue to see dramatic improvements in these wells as compared to the prior completions. And this is, as shown here, in various zones in various areas across the field. So it gives us confidence that the investment in 3.0+ style completions and the additional capital required for those is money well spent.","As we move forward, the way to think about the program will be us tailoring and customizing completions by zone and by area to optimize capital efficiency. Certainly, 3.0+ importantly will play an important role in that program. But, of course, we're just going to optimize each specific well, each zone, each area to get the best results on an economic capital employed basis.","Now turning to slide 8, we continue to execute a significant growth trajectory in the company, as shown. Third quarter continues that growth as we show in a forecast here with Permian only at a range of 278,000 to 288,000 BOE per day and, of course, that shapes us up for a strong finish in 2018.","Going to slide 9. I think this is a really important slide from the standpoint of looking at this business long-term which we have to do. We continue to reap the benefits of long-term planning in the Permian. As we all realize, this is a multi-decade development and it needs multi-decade thinking in advance. And you can look at this slide and realize, as an example, natural gas processing comes to mind as something that's very important that we need to invest in. And in particular regarding Targa's gas processing system, they will be adding three new facilities, three new plants beginning actually later in September this year and two more in the first half of next year that will actually increase our capacity by 70% compared to where it is today.","So we're taking broad brush steps to make sure that issues surrounding line pressure and just availability of gas processing that we're ahead of. And toward that end, the planning is associated now with as opposed to putting in 200 million cubic feet a day plants as has been the past track record, moving forward to adding 250 million cubic feet a day plants as a part of that plan going forward.","You can look at water as another example. We believe that, first of all, water availability and disposal is an issue that needs to be dealt with long-term, but that said our environmental footprint is very important to us as well. And you can see on the graph on the bottom left that the plan is to actually get to a point where our use of freshwater approaches zero in a few years. In fact, once we increase our reuse volumes and also bring the Midland water processing facility online in probably early 2020 or so, we're getting down to a very low percentage.","Right now, we're increasing our reuse volumes of our produced water to the point where it's going to represent 15% to 20% of our water volumes in the fourth quarter this year. So we're taking very specific steps, and this is an excellent environmental step on the one hand but it increases returns, because the economics on produced water and, for that matter, our effluent water systems are quite excellent.","I've already mentioned the benefits of FT. It gives us a tremendous amount of insulation from backups that happen in the domestic markets where we were just producing too much oil and can't move it out. But we will have FT scoped out in our case all the way through early parts of 2021. We'll be looking at other opportunities in the future as well. I think the main messaging here is that long-term planning is essential here and we've been investing in it for some time, we continue to invest in it, and we think it's a very big important aspect of having reliable execution. And it's all about improving the economics and reducing our cost structure.","Now, going to slide 11, and just reiterating that our model and our go-forward plan really remains the same. It's over the next many years to enhance shareholder value through drilling strong return wells that then feed into strong corporate returns and basically featuring capital discipline. We do believe in return of capital. We're heading hopefully as quickly as possible towards a cash flow generative model and we think as a part of that, having the strongest or one of the strongest balance sheets in the energy patch gives us financial flexibility to pull that off. And the main message as I really referred to in the earlier slide is this is a long-term program, multi-decade campaign, so we need to be thinking that way, but also it reduces risk as we go forward. Again, the message being we have a program we believe is very good use of capital. It's a high rate of return on capital employed but also, as a result, leads to the opportunities for increased return of capital to shareholders.","So with that, I'm going to pass it onto Rich for more color on the benefits of FT and our marketing strategy, as well as a review of our financials and a look towards the third quarter.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. I'm going to pick up on slide 11 and really reiterate what Tim discussed earlier on our FT uplift during the quarter.","So you can see here that we did move 165,000 barrels a day of oil to the Gulf Coast that did add, as Tim mentioned, $69 million of incremental cash flow, or about $4.10 per barrel uplift to our oil realized prices. Of that, 103,000 barrels a day was exported. That was primarily to Asia and Europe. And as you look forward, starting in August, those barrels that we can export can increase because now we have access beginning here in August to all of our barrels getting on the water and really being able to be exported now that the facility is available in Houston and so those will all get Brent-related pricing.","We do have about 10% or so of our barrels that are sold in the Midland Basin still but, as Tim mentioned, we did toggle on one of our contracts to move to a Cushing-based pricing starting in September, so we now are 100% insulated from Midland\/Cushing differentials starting in September.","Turning to slide 12. This slide really is intended to provide some color on the two main pricing components of our firm transportation uplift. The first is the Brent\/WTI differential and the second is the Midland\/Cushing differential. Simplistically, we are receiving Brent-related prices for 90% of our oil sales that we take to the Gulf Coast versus a Midland price. However, there are some timing items that affect the price. For instance, for the majority of our Gulf Coast refinery and export sales, the Brent\/WTI differential is fixed at the time the sales contract is entered into, which is typically about two months prior to the planned delivery really just to allow time for ship logistics and dock space planning.","The second component, the Midland\/Cushing differential, is typically determined on a trading month basis for the month of delivery or roughly one month in advance of when the delivery actually takes place. So as a result, as what Tim mentioned of wider differentials for Brent\/WTI in May through July, and wider Midland\/Cushing differentials in June through August to-date, we do anticipate a significant uplift in third quarter cash flow from our firm transportation. The second quarter as I mentioned earlier was $69 million that was up from $16 million in the first quarter and the third quarter uplift is more than 2x, over $175 million uplift expected for the third quarter.","Turning to slide 13, and really looking at similar to what we do on oil on the gas side. We move to the Southern California markets that are tied to Southern California gas price index about 70% of our production. The remainder is sold at Waha under term contracts to utilities primarily. The benefit of moving out to the Southern California markets was a $0.25 uplift in gas prices in the second quarter. If you look at July, because of the heat that's been hitting out in Southern California, we do expect about a $0.60 uplift in July and based on where we are in August, about a $2 uplift in realized prices for those sales in August.","As I mentioned last quarter, we did secure firm transportation on Gulf Coast Express, the Kinder Morgan's pipeline. That is expected to come online early in Q4 2019, and at that point in time we'll have access to LNG exports that we've already actually signed up one contract related to that and then other sales to refineries, petrochemical facilities and into Mexico. So as you can see from this, with our firm transportation arrangements, we are in great position to ensure that all our gas moves out of the basin and really into higher-priced gas markets.","Turning to slide 14, and looking at our earnings summary for the quarter. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $66 million or $0.38 per diluted share. That did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the increase in NYMEX oil prices during the quarter of $170 million or $0.99 per diluted share. And then we had three unusual items all related to our ongoing asset divestiture program. That was a net charge of $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share. So after adjusting for those items, we are at $243 million for the quarter, or $1.41 per share.","At the bottom of the slide, we show our actual results compared to our quarterly guidance. As you can see, our reported second quarter production was 328,000 BOEs per day for the quarter, which is above the top end of the guidance range. The second quarter production includes 5,800 BOEs a day of gas or 35,000 Mcf per day that we should have started including in production during the first quarter of 2018 in accordance with the new revenue recognition rules. Unfortunately, after reviewing one of the contracts further, we realized that these volumes were netted to cover certain electric and fuel-related charges. Consequently, we had to adjust for those volumes in the second quarter and move the fees from being reported as a reduction in revenue to production costs.","Similar to the other revenue recognition items that we recognized in the first quarter, there was no earnings or cash flow impact associated with this change. The net effect is that the second quarter includes 35,000 Mcf a day of gas production related to the first quarter and 36,000 Mcf per day of gas that's related to the second quarter for this change. To be clear, there was no wellhead gas production change. Our wellhead production continues to be consistent with our expectations. This was just an accounting change. The rest of the items on the bottom of that table are consistent with our guidance, so really no news there.","Turning to slide 15, looking at our price realizations. We did change up our oil bar here to include our FT uplift. So if you look on a adjusted for our transportation, moving barrels to the Gulf Coast, oil prices were up 4% quarter over quarter. If you look at the bottom of the table below the second quarter, you can see that the uplift basically covered our widening differentials in Midland for the quarter. NGL prices were up 4% quarter over quarter, and gas prices were down 24% quarter over quarter, mainly due to decline in NYMEX prices coming out of the winter demand season and then as we've all seen, substantially wider differentials on gas in all basins across the U.S.","Turning to slide 16. You'll see that production costs quarter over quarter were fairly consistent. There are two items to note. One, being the gathering processing and transportation increase really reflects the incremental re-class I just mentioned on our contract that we moved fees from revenue down to production costs, so that had no impact on cash flow or earnings, just a re-class. And then LOE is up slightly, really due to higher seasonal electricity costs for the quarter. We had a really hot May and June out in West Texas and that increased the demand and therefore pricing for electricity. The other item is labor costs really driven by activity with higher oil prices that Tim talked about, and so we have seen some inflation on labor.","Turning to slide 17, looking at our liquidity position. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet and excellent liquidity, with $800 million of net debt at the end of the second quarter. Our cash on hand was at $1.5 billion. As Tim mentioned, we did pay off $450 million of bonds during the quarter and so that's reflected in there. If you look at the maturity schedule, no near-term maturities at this point and the company's in excellent financial condition.","Turning to slide 18. The only change here is that we are just now giving guidance for Permian Basin on production, production costs and DD&A, given our ongoing divestiture process and the timing of closing certain of those sales. So other than that, the rest of the guidance items are on a total company basis, so I'm not going to go through them individually, but they're there for your review for the upcoming third quarter.","So with that, why don't I stop there and we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from John Freeman from Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, John.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Good morning.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So on the additional 4 rigs as you mentioned, Tim, it doesn't change the previous number of wells that you're looking to POP. So as we think about the significant number of DUCs that kind of build up, how should we think about cadence of those DUCs being worked down in 2019?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think we will, of course, as we're starting this up in August and our typical spud-to-POP timing is going to be, say 150, 170 days on a three-well pad, you can see that we're talking five months. So we really won't even be completing wells until probably January from the additional rigs. And so what it'll do is it'll affect the cadence of 2019 POPs basically or DUCs. The DUCs, we'll start to reduce that count of DUCs starting early next year.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously, you all have done a phenomenal job on the marketing side and getting so much of your crude to the Gulf Coast. I'm just curious, how much \u2013 what percentage of you all's exports right now goes to China?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Rich, you want to comment on that?","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, we probably have only had a couple sales this year to China and none recently, and so I think as all these oils are fungible and they move around, and so I think China's reduced their takes out of the U.S. And those barrels have now just gone to the place where China was getting them \u2013 or barrels that China was getting, we're not getting them today. So I think it just is one of those things that it's a global market and the barrels will move around to find the home where they need to be but the demand is still there.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great. Yeah, so the tariffs that kind of got announced today basically has zero impact on you guys it sounds like. Well, thanks a lot for the answers. That was a great quarter.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, John. Appreciate it.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim, I wonder if you could help, just if you could dig into the CapEx guide just a little bit more, if that's okay. So when you set your long-term guidance out to 2026, one assumes that you had had some idea what the rig cadence was going to be. So adding the 4 rigs in the second half of this year I'm guessing was in the original 2018 budget. If it wasn't, can you explain how that's changed and how we should think about the rig trajectory as we go into subsequent years? What I'm really trying to get at is when you set the 2019 budget, are we assuming rig additions at the end of 2019? Or do we get another CapEx increase as we move through the year? I'm just trying to understand if that was in the original plan. And if not, what changed?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Doug. I'd have to go fish out the original plan that we put out in relation, but I recall that we were generally talking about adding about 4 rigs that would support the 2019 campaign. Thus, it's just a matter of the timing of when you want to put those on. In our case, we want to get a little bit of a head start for 2019, so it's a little bit of a bump to the capital budget. We didn't have granularity of which month they would come on when this FERC plan was first put out a couple of years ago. As we get closer, we're just sort of maneuvering to hit the kind of numbers we want to hit with regard to execution and that means the idea to put these 4 rigs on now makes sense. As it relates to what we might put on late next year, gosh, Doug, we haven't even really developed our 2019 plan yet, so it'll be too early for me to comment on that.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But just to be clear of what I'm asking, so the 2018 or the 2019 plan, whatever year it is, to tell us that you're going to add rigs, should we then assume that when you make that kind of comment that we're going to add rigs that the capital program doesn't include those rig additions?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, we have not solidified, for example, on when we would add the 2019 rigs until we've got essentially into this middle part of the year. And so it did not include those 4 extra rigs for this year's capital budget. Now, it is in there and that's one of the reasons that we've adjusted the budget. And so that's the way I would answer the question and we would probably approach it the same way next year. We're going to go into the year running 24 rigs. We'll see exactly how we might want to adjust as we get to the end of 2019, but that's all still being evaluated.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My quick follow-up hopefully is a quick follow-up. Given that you've now quantified the 3.0+ wells in the second half of this year presumably you've got some idea, I guess, maybe you haven't defined it yet for 2019, but so with the additional 4 rigs plus the incremental 3.0+ wells, does that mean that you're actually accelerating the pace versus the original 10-year plan? Or is this still the base case? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I don't think we're really accelerating the case. What we're doing with the 3.0+ wells is just improving the completions if you will. I think the real important message about that is the one I mentioned during my actually prepared commentary, which is to say we're not going to be using 3.0+ across the whole field because we've determined some areas it's just not necessary. We see some areas, for example, where we would use a 3.0+ style amount of proppant but we might not need as much water in certain areas.","So there's not a cookie-cutter approach here; it's going to be evaluated and tailor-made basically by completion, by area, by zone. So I think from that standpoint, nothing has changed in terms of our long-term modeling. We're just trying to get more efficient and making sure we're being capital efficient in the way we're doing things. In other words, no sense spending more money on a 3.0+ style completion if we can get it done with a 3.0. That would be the principle.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the answers, Tim. Thanks a lot for your time.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. And, Arun, your line is open.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. First question is for Rich. Rich, you highlighted the cash flow uplift from FT and marketing in Q3. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what that could look like in 4Q and in 2019 if we just assume the futures market for differentials proves correct.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think if you look at the futures market, the Brent\/WTI spread roughly is $7 for the rest of the year. And if you look at that and then the Mid\/Cush differential, it tightens over the remainder of the year. There's like a pipeline that going up to Cushing I believe comes on it and moves a little bit more barrels. So in general, I think the fourth quarter could look similar to the third quarter, if things stay where they're at and prices stay where they're at. And then as you move into 2019, if Mid\/Cush differentials tighten, then that uplift will come down, some based on that spread tightening on Midland\/Cushing. So I think that's really where you can do the modeling and calculate what those would look like.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","The only thing I'd add is our volumes is going up too, the actual dollar per barrel is what you're referring to, but the actual gross dollars we're talking about are going to be significantly higher all other things equal, because our volume of exports is going up.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","And our FT, we built it to match with our production growth, so you'll see our FT volumes that we're moving to the Gulf Coast increase as well.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great. And my follow up, just a clarification Tim on your guidance commentary. You reiterated the upper half of the 19% to 24% Permian production growth outlook for total volumes. I just want to see does that also apply to your oil production to be the upper half of the range for oil?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, it does.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you talk a bit more about the Spraberry and Jo Mill appraisal programs, specifically what your hypothesis is in terms of development strategy and spacing? And we wonder a little because with Lower Spraberry wells achieving some of the greatest uplift from your Version 3.0 completions, how would you expect well performance to change if at all in a development mode situation and optimal spacing?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, great question. This is an important topic. I'm going to let Joey Hall answer your question, Brian.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Brian. Good morning. Really that's why you see us progressing the stack bury testing. Of course, we've done a lot of drilling in the Lower Spraberry Shale but not nearly as much in the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry. We just put the first test online. We're deploying our new and larger completions, and going forward, I would see us start to increase the amount of wells that we do in each one of these areas, because they're a significant part of our 1 million in 10 initiative, so we have very high expectations.","We know the Lower Spraberry Shale much better than we do the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry, but everything that we do and everything we see from our competitors around us leaves us incredibly optimistic. So looking forward to the results and you'll hear a lot more about particularly the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry next quarter.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then I guess would we see \u2013 would you expect any degradation relative to the extent of the advantaged uplift that you're seeing in Lower Spraberry in a development scenario, i.e. are we seeing excessively good wells there as a result of just being early on in that program or not?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I wouldn't say so. I would say what we've drilled is what we expect. And we've applied a lot of science to this stack bury test and we have over 1,000 wells that we've drilled in the Permian so far and we're taking all the lessons that we've learned. We had similar issues between the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B, and the lengths that we went to understand how we should stimulate these wells and what the spacing should be has been quite extensive, so I have no expectation that we'd see any degradation compared to anything we've seen in the past. To the contrary, because our completions have evolved, I would expect us to see better results in our Lower Spraberry.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's great. And my follow-up is with regards to a follow up on Arun's question on the guidance in the Permian for the rest of the year. If both oil and total production are trending towards the upper end of the range, that would seem to imply an increase particularly in the fourth quarter in the oil mix, the oil as a percent of the total relative to your recent adjusted mix. Is that something that you see and is that just have to do with the timing of bringing wells on or are we looking at it the wrong way?","Neal H. Shah - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Brian. It's Neal Shah. It's not the oil mix that's going to increase. Really, I think what you're looking at is the impact of ASC 606 both oil and BOEs increase at a similar rate into 4Q to hit our full-year guidance and to get to that middle half, that upper middle half as we're talking about.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, I think there's been a bit of confusion on this and even I think even in a little bit here right now, but that's certainly something to follow up on even after the adjustment is made.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think we'll talk to you about that later offline.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit in terms of the development approach as it relates to the stacked intervals we've kind of talked about it on the stack bury test, but just wanted to revisit your thoughts on how you're approaching the Wolfcamp A and B developments. What's the current thought on the need to approach those concurrently to avoid any sort of depletion issues or interference issues as you come back through if you were to develop them on a single stand-alone basis versus a concurrent basis? How are you approaching that today? And how has that changed, if at all, versus the past?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I wouldn't say that it's changed, but it has evolved. And you see \u2013 across-the-board, you see all three different options. You see scenarios, where we can drill the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B independently, and timing is not that significant. You see other areas, where we believe that you should come shortly thereafter within nine months to a year after drilling the Wolfcamp B and hit the Wolfcamp A. And then, we also have examples where we believe that you should drill the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B at the same time and zipper frac them. So as we've evolved and seeing longer-term production on these wells, it kind of goes back to the completion recipe. It's going to vary across the field, so we've got all three examples.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","What is it \u2013 what's like the driving factor that influences whether or not it should be in each of those categories? I'm sure it's a complicated answer, but is there any way to simplify that?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's actually pretty simple. Thickness is one and presence or lack thereof of a frac barrier. It really comes down to that. There's even areas on the farther eastern acreage where Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B is a single development, so and then, as you come across in north and south. And if you look at the maps of how we do this, it's not something you can predict without looking at the maps. I mean, there's holes in the map where you do it one way and there's fringes where you do it another way. There's a lot of different variables that go into this. And again, going back to the 1,000 wells that we've drilled and completed, we've been able to kind of zero in on this.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And the spacing configuration in the Wolfcamp A and B at present, what's the current go-forward plan on that?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Typically, we're going to be anywhere between 750 and 850 feet.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Okay. And then, I guess, if I could just one last. In terms of returns of cash, you guys have the modest buyback program this year. At any point in the next couple of years, do you think we see that picked up? When do you think we could, like at the earliest, see that given the current strip?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So what I mentioned in my earlier comments, Michael, is that our longer-term vision and actually action plan is to get to a point where we're cash flow generative to be able to actually make that decision. And so I think we need to kind of wait until we're at that point. And you'll notice at that point in time, we'll be spending a lot of time on that question. Certainly, it's a matter of our board's review and they're very focused on this exact question. And in fact, it'll be a topic at our August board meeting. So I can assure you it's top of mind and a front burner, but we need to get there first.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tim, to you and the whole team there.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hey, Charles. How are you?","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Doing well. Thank you. Tim, if I could go back to the Version 3.0+, your incremental 60 completions with that design in the back half of the year, and you touched on this a bit in your prepared comments. Can you give us a sense, are those more completions in areas where you've already proven that this is the style of completion that's needed and where you're getting the uplift? Or is some fraction of that trying to take this new completion design to new areas?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Joey, you want to comment on that?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Charles. What I would say is for the most part and I can't quote exact percentages. For the most part, we're going back to areas where we know we've been successful and then in a few areas. We're even drilling in some new areas currently, so we're deploying those in the new areas and seeing what success we have. What I would tell you is that even going into this, particularly in areas where we've drilled and completed, we go into areas with the expectation that it's going to be helpful, not just trial and error to try something to see if it does or doesn't work. So there's some thought that goes into where we try these things, that there's areas where we've seen through past drilling and completions that we don't believe that they would be successful. But for the most part, we're going to areas where we believe we're going to be successful based on past or current technology.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That makes sense, Joey. Thanks for that detail. And then really maybe following up on that, I was looking at your slide, slide 7, which I think is really one of the interesting ones to see an update on every quarter. And one of those Version 3.0+ curves is not like the others, right? It's the one in the upper left and you could say that it has a positive second derivative through maybe the first six months or certainly, you could say it looks like accelerating volumes for the first six months of flow-backing. It really seems to be a standout, and I wonder if you could talk about if you have any confident explanations about what's going on there or perhaps just hypotheses that you're working on.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes. The only thing I would comment on that differentiates that as well is it's a Lower Spraberry shale development. So as you can see, you know optically, I understand exactly what you're saying. But if you look at the dataset, it's a smaller dataset as well and that's in one of our better areas. And it just goes to show that as we were talking about earlier and as Tim alluded to, there's certain areas where these 3.0+ completions and in this particular case, Lower Spraberry shale just makes a significant impact. And then you go across the board, you see that it changes and that correlates to why we continue to do this in some areas and that we may be a little bit more cautious in other areas.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Charles, just to add, I think the datasets are materially different, 27 on the lower curve and 6 wells on the upper curve. But we will be having more data. We have six more of these type of Lower Spraberry shale 3.0+ tests in the second half. So we'll be building up our dataset and we'll be able to kind of address that a little more clearly to you once we get the results from those wells that we can pile those on to the already six that we have and get a little bit smarter about why they are performing as well as they are. Don't get me wrong, we're happy about it.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's helpful. We'll look forward to that. Thanks, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Charles.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Portillo from TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a follow up or potentially a little bit of clarification. Given the moderated growth in Q2 and the commentary around the upper end of guidance for the full year, it implies a pretty large ramp in production for the fourth quarter which obviously sets up well for 2019. Just trying to understand a little bit better what's driving that incremental improvement in growth, given the ratable POP schedule in the back half of this year.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think if you take a look at it, first of all, our ranges are put in place to reflect all different outcomes for sure. I think the third quarter in general, has starting off, very strong fashion and we'll see how it finishes off. Of course, we're speaking now about something like a month and a half of data, so the third quarter may be a little bit conservative. So I think that's kind of where we're leaning. And the fact is the moderated growth you saw in the second quarter to a great extent not counting the other factors we mentioned, was a product of the fact that we only had 19 POPs in April.","So you do the math on that, you realize five, six wells swinging here and there that produce 2,000 barrels a day are enough to substantially move the numbers. So it is a very complicated evaluation because there's so many moving parts. But the bottom-line is we're confident, and it has to do with the fact that the back-weighted growth in the second quarter but also, I think it's a fact going into the second half of the year, you have the Targa gas plant on. I think it's supposed to come on the end of September. So if you look at the fourth quarter in particular, we should see a significant bump in production that comes from the fact we would have relatively lower line pressure issues. And that certainly is a contributory fact I think as well. So there's a lot of factors that give us confidence, but I think we also have to execute.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. That's extremely helpful. And then the follow-up question pertains to the Wolfcamp D. You had early success in delineation of this horizon with modern completions year-to-date. Curious around your current thoughts around this horizon and how it may factor into development as you move forward into 2019 and beyond.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Matt, we characterize the Wolfcamp D as being applicable to about 60% of our acreage and I would look at the Wolfcamp D very similarly to the way that I would look at the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry Shale and Lower Spraberry Shale. We continue to delineate, we continue to see promising results, and as the development plan progresses over the next couple of years you'll start to see us layer in more Wolfcamp D wells.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, Tim, and rest of the team. Tim, my question is a little detailed, it's just on your guide, your 2018 guide up there. I'm just wondering, does that bake in any downtime for the Targa plant or just any other variables like that in that updated 2018 guide?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So we always have downtime built-in and it has to do with a statistical evaluation of the past, because it can be calculated somewhat based on many, many years in this field. Of course, we had a bit of a statistical anomaly in the second quarter related to multiple bad weather events that we've really never seen in the month of May before, but that all being said, we have downtime and some room in our forecast that's associated with making sure that we allocate the potential impacts of these kind of issues. And so yeah, the answer is it's in there. I wouldn't say we have a specific number in there related to the Targa plant coming on. The plant is evidently still planned for the very end of September and from our standpoint, we understand that's on schedule.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good, and then one just follow up on M&As. It seems like from my talks of privates out in the Midland Basin there seems to be a number, I don't know, I don't want to say potentially for sale of some decent-sized Midland Basin companies. Would you have interest in any of these given your already-existing large inventory position?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think you got it right in that last part of the question. We have such I think an extreme amount of inventory to work on and we're doing it as fast as we can that our main objective in terms of adding value when it comes to anything related to what you're talking about is actually the exchange of acres, the trading of acreage. That's where the real value comes in with when you have such an extensive portfolio that we have and we are still in the midst right now of multiple set of transactions to exchange acreage to trade acreage. And we're talking about millions of lateral feet added as our goal, and million lateral feet adds $1 billion worth of value essentially so that's where we see the real value.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good thanks for the answers, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel Financial.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Tim, with the understanding that you're better protected from inflationary pressures than most of your peers, how do you see the service price environment playing out over the next several quarters if the industry is faced with Midland netbacks that are less than $50 a barrel? Do you think the service companies are trying to look through that potential period of weakness?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, I think first of all, we've had a more significant increase in cost issue than we would have assumed. Now, as we started the year, we were of course talking about 5% to 7% increase. Now, oil prices have gone up, take hedges out of the mix but they've gone up from $49 to $69 so a 40% move in oil prices. So from that standpoint, having the inflation we have is not unexpected. I think though as you look forward and you realize with pipeline constraints, that is to say on both oil and gas, coming to fruition, it'll probably lead to a slowdown in completion somewhat. The rigs in general are contracted for longer periods of time than the fracked fleets. So I think the rig count you see is relatively stabilized and not moving.","That makes sense when you get into multiple years or several year rig contracts. But I think what's going to happen is the slowdown on the completion front. That's naturally what makes sense if you have essentially full pipelines. That does not bode well for increases in costs when activity levels are coming down. And you see some of the big service companies now saying we're not bringing additional, for example, frac fleets into the basin while margins are not improving any more than they are. And so I think we could have a situation where if we can stagnate oil prices where they are today, we might be able to put more of a lid on service cost increases and cost increases in general in 2019 as compared to this year, just a product of a slowdown in relative completion activity.","There's a lot of ancillary aspects of completion activity that would also slowdown. I think the other side of the coin though as we look at 2020 and 2021 when the pipelines are now in place and in full in terms of their ability to take volume, that could be another period of inflationary activity to the point where everyone is trying to get their DUC count reduced. And so I would say the bigger risk inflation-wise is really past 2019. It's really 2020 and 2021. Everything else equal.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That makes sense, Tim. And as a follow up to your comment on the customization of your Version 3.0+ design, could you speak to the level of customization that is applied by zone, by area across the field? And what I'm really trying to do is get a better sense on the degree of variation in proppant loading and fluid loading and cluster spacing.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure. Joey?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Derrick, I wish I could quantitatively answer your question but as you see us explain 3.0+ completions, even my team begins to get confused on which ones we're referring to. I would say we have a dozen plus different recipes. And even if you look at the stack bury test, for example, the way I'm completing my Middle Spraberry is with 2,500 pounds per foot, the Jo Mills with 1,400 pounds per foot, so nearly half, and then the Lower Spraberry Shale with 2,500 pounds per foot. And then with the 3.0+, they're 2,500 pounds per foot plus. We're still doing some that are 1,700 pounds per foot. Again, when I go back to my description of how we do the Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B, the recipes just vary greatly across the field and there's just no way I can characterize it by zone or even by area necessarily. There's just literally a dozen-plus recipes that we're using.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","It's a good reason why we have area teams who are very specifically located in their areas where things change and it's their job to decipher what's optimal.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. That was very helpful.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani from NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. Just wanted to ask a little about some of the infrastructure bottlenecks you guys saw in the second quarter here. It sounds like from your comments that you've kind of baked some downtime in here in the third quarter but just trying to get a sense as the Targa plants come online in September and then I guess a couple more next year, do you guys generally see those problems starting to disappear as we head into 4Q in 2019?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, I think we've baked in, as I already commented on, Leo, some impact in the third quarter. We can relatively clearly estimate that just by basic run rates today of line pressure issues, it comes and goes. As we put new compression in the field with Targa, you'll see reductions in line pressures in those areas and you'll see them increase in other areas. But the big fix is to get the new big plants on and what that allows us to do is to reduce the system line pressure. There's other ways, of course, to solve it in the interim, which is take some gas off the system and so on. But the fact is we have it baked into our third quarter guidance. I think it's really less of an issue in fourth quarter. It certainly becomes a relatively minor issue after the first half of next year when we have dramatic increases in Targa processing capacity.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just jumping over a little bit to CapEx, just trying to get a sense of how much you guys actually had spent in Q2. And then additionally you guys added about $400 million to $500 million to the budget. Is there any kind of high-level way to break that down just in percentages in terms of how much was cost inflation and how much was sort of new activity?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, if you look overall at the impacts of the adjustment to the budget, we would calculate that activities are somewhere between 35% to 40% of the change and cost changes are probably 50% to 60% of the changes. That's probably the way it breaks down. Second quarter D&C would be at the current run rate of the 3.3, 3.4.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Beard from Coker, Palmer.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. Appreciate the time.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure, David.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","Just a big picture question relative to pricing differentials. You could make the guess that you'd bet on better export pricing when you set up your infrastructure. So would you care to share just your thoughts longer-term on Brent differentials and\/or Midland differentials just as it relates to how you've positioned the company infrastructure-wise? Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, David. I think if you look at the long-term, if you have plenty of pipeline capacity to the Gulf Coast and you also have plenty of export capacity to go to world markets, then you should see WTI or the Houston market, if you want to call it that trading, at basically a discount to Brent, which is associated with basically the transportation cost to move WTI to foreign markets. In this case, you'd probably expect it to be $1.50 to $2.00 off Brent in their longer-term without pipeline constraints. To get prices elsewhere such as the Cushing or Midland at that point you just back off the cost to move the oil.","And so if you look at our current cost on FT to move oil from Midland to Midland Tank Farm to the Gulf Coast is about $2.50 roughly on average. So that ought to help you with trying to frame up what the long-term thinking is. Now, what we're doing right now essentially is taking advantage of short-term anomalies and we just happened to have the oil in the right place at the right time. Having it on the Gulf Coast is where the money is being made and that's the benefit we're seeing today.","David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.","That's great. Appreciate the clarity, and congratulations on the quarter.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, David.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Tim Dove, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I want to thank everybody for spending time with us and being on the call. I hope the rest of your summer is enjoyable for you. Stay out of the heat, and we'll be seeing you in the fall on the road. Thanks very much.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Scott will be the first speaker. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the third quarter of 2012. He'll then follow up by giving you an update of the company's production growth outlook and capital program for this year. He will then provide a progress report on our joint venture negotiations for the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale and provide some color on our planned divestiture of our Barnett Shale properties.","After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will discuss our drilling results and plans for the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale, the Spraberry vertical and the Eagle Ford Shale. He'll also comment on the 2 horizontal wells we drilled to test the Jo Mill interval in the Spraberry field, and he'll update you on the upcoming winter drilling program in Alaska. Rich will then cover the third quarter financials in more detail and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. And then after that, we'll turn the call over to the people on the call for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Thanks, Frank, good morning. I do echo Frank's comments about the Hurricane Sandy. Highlights on Slide #3. Third quarter adjusted income of $104 million, or $0.82 per adjusted share; our production, 159,900 barrels a day equivalent over the range that we gave out for guidance for the third quarter. When you adjust it for the Barnett Shale going into discontinued ops, we were 153,000 barrels a day equivalent. Above the end of the -- top end of the range of 155,000 to 159,000 barrels a day. Production over the last year, up 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or 28%; and also the oil growth is up 52% over the last 12 months.","From second quarter 2012, oil growth is up 5%, production's up 10,000 barrels a day, or up 7%. Again, strong growth primarily attributed to Spraberry vertical program of going deeper, horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play and the Eagle Ford Shale drilling programs. We're continuing to see tremendous performance from going to the Strawn, the Atoka and the Mississippian and co-mingling with the Spraberry Wolfcamp zones in all of our deeper vertical drilling in the Spraberry field. And again, continue to see strong Eagle Ford performance and achieving record production levels.","We're narrowing our 2012 production growth guidance range from 25% to 29%, to 27% to 28% based on year-to-date results. That's taking the Barnett Shale out for discontinued ops. When you add that back in, we're at the high end of that range of 28% to 29%.","Going to Slide #4, our highlights. We continue to see tremendous success from our successful horizontal Wolfcamp Shale program and our southern 200,000 acres are meeting essentially our type curve of 575,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We're continuing to drill at wells now in Midland County, we'll be going to Martin County shortly, which Tim will talk more about as we move up north.","We'll talk more about our joint venture. We're pursuing the joint venture partner to accelerate our horizontal Wolfcamp Shale development in our southern 200,000 acres. The data room is still open today as we speak. We're increasing our 2000 (sic) [2012] drilling budget by $100 million primarily to accelerate the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale appraisal activity. We essentially have a -- started a fifth horizontal rig drilling the Midland and Martin County horizontal wells and we actually had a 6th rig for a period of about 30 to 45 days drilling 2 very successful Jo Mill wells, which is in the Spraberry section in our Spraberry Trend Area field. We had 1 well over 550 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It's still increasing, both wells are still increasing. And essentially, the Jo Mill has been our main producing formation for the last 30 to 40 years and essentially covers our entire 900,000 acres. Very, very excited about those results.","We announced our Barnett Shale divestiture. The data room is open, allows us to reallocate capital. In addition, the last 2 months, when oil ran up about 30 days ago, we have added several hedging positions from 2013 to 2015 and added more gas positions from '14 and '15 using primarily 3-way collars. We expect to call our convertible senior notes, 2038, that are due 2038 for redemption, the first time we have that right in early in 2013 on January 15 based on a September 30 closing stock price of $104.40. Conversion of the notes would result in paying $480 million in cash and issuing 3.3 million shares. The $480 million cash we would just borrow off our facility. The interest rate would go down from 2 7\/8% to approximately 2%. In addition, our last VPP will be running out at the end of December, it expires at the end of 2012, provides 3,500 barrels of oil a day, increased production volumes and without increasing our op costs.","Slide #5, our continued strong production growth continues in 2012. And again, our range going into the fourth quarter is 154,000 to 158,000 barrels a day. We're taking Barnett out. In addition, we're showing a 27% to 28% range, but when you add Barnett in, we're essentially at the high end of 28% to 29%, again, driven by the Spraberry vertical program, the horizontal Wolfcamp program and the Eagle Ford Shale program during 2012. We also note, we've gone up from 47% liquids in 2010 to 61% liquids in the third quarter.","Going to Slide #6 on capital spending and cash flow. Our capital program, as I mentioned already, we increased the drilling capital by $100 million from $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion primarily by the 5th horizontal rig drilling in Midland and Martin County, and also we drilled a -- we had a 6th rig for a period of a few weeks drilling the 2 Jo Mill wells. Funded by all the items below, combination of the cash flow, equity proceeds, liquidated derivatives and inventory reduction, credit facility borrowings to balance it in regard to cash flow spending.","An update on the Wolfcamp Shale joint venture opportunity. As you recall, we're offering anywhere from 1\/3 to 50% of Pioneer's work interest in the southern 200,000 acres. It's over 4,000 potential horizontal development locations. It does exclude downspacing. The -- we're currently drilling on 140-acre spacing. Most of these oil shale plays are going down to somewhere between 50 and 60 acres, so that's additional upside. It's a 2 billion-barrel gross resource potential; liquids content about 90%; and again, our type curve is 575,000 barrels of oil equivalent for a 7,000-foot lateral. Tim will talk more about some recent activity on some longer laterals. And a great IRR of 45% at $85 oil and $4 gas. We've had participants from all over the world come in to our data room. It's been open about 2 months. We expect bids in the month of December and we expect to announce a successful JV opportunity during the first quarter of 2013.","Going to Slide #8, an update on the planned Barnett Shale divestiture; 120,000 net acres, 2\/3 are located in the liquids-rich Combo Play of the Barnett Shale.  We reported third quarter production of 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We're already up over 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, being 55% liquids, a combination of oil and NGLs; 181 wells on production; over 1,100 total locations to drill.  We currently have 1 rig operating, continuing to grow production with just 1 rig, and the reason is we're allocating the capital to Pioneer's higher return core assets in South Texas and West Texas.","Data room just opened this week. We expect bids in the month of December and expect again to announce the successful divestiture during first quarter of 2013.","Last slide, investment highlights, on Slide #9. Pioneer now has a -- just a total U.S. asset base. We have one of the highest exposures from proved reserves and estimated net resource potential of over 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Again, the 2012 drilling program, in going forward, focused on the Spraberry vertical deep program, the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale program and the Eagle Ford Shale program. The joint venture obviously will allow us to greatly accelerate going to '13, '14 and '15 the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale program on the joint venture properties. Again, the Barnett Shale divestiture will allow us to reallocate capital to our core assets in South and West Texas. Tremendous strong production profile; vertical integration continuing to improving returns; again, attractive some of the best hedged positions in the universe for 2012, '13 and '14 for the company; and again, a strong investment-grade financial position allows us to move forward. Now I'll turn it over to Tim to go over the operating results.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. First, starting on Slide 10, we'll give you an update regarding how the horizontal Wolfcamp drilling campaign is going, and suffice it to say, we continue to focus our drilling in the oval area, the southern 200,000 acres shown on the map, where we're focused on holding 50,000 acres that would otherwise expire by the end of 2013. Accordingly, we need to drill and have on production about 90 wells by then. We're well on track to get that done. We've already drilled 27 wells and have 17 of those on production. I'll show you some more data on those wells shortly.","Currently, we're running 4 rigs in the southern area, a total of 5 rigs. And I'll touch on the additional rig drilling to the north in a minute. We are going to be increasing the rig count to 7 by the end of the year, and those rigs are already contracted. As to the northern activity, this is the first wells we'll be drilling in Midland County. You can see approximately where the drilling is occurring by virtue of the arrow on the map. Those -- we are just in the process of drilling 2 wells, they're about 750 feet apart. The first will be in the A zone, and the second in -- sorry, the first will be in the B zone and the second will be in the A zone. The first of those has already been drilled. And actually, we're rigging up on the second well as we speak. When both of the wells are done, they'll both be frac-ed essentially back-to-back. And so I anticipate we'll have results regarding these wells during the February earnings call.","As Scott mentioned also, we'll be marching to the north of that point, probably drilling a couple of wells in Martin County, perhaps followed by wells in Gaines County. The idea is to prove up our substantial acreage position in the north. And we believe these areas will be prospective in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale. We're still targeting a minimum of 7,000-foot laterals and we're testing longer laterals. In fact, we just recently drilled a 10,000-foot lateral in about 19 days. So where we have the leasehold, you'll see us extending the laterals significantly beyond 7,000 feet.","We have also been successful in drilling what we refer to as development-style wells. Those are wells that do not have any science. It would be more akin to what we'll be drilling as we develop the field, and we've actually confirmed that we can drill those for about $7 million. A lot of the reason we can do it relatively cheaply is the fact we're using 85% Brady Brown sand from Premier Silica, our sand mine in Brady, Texas, and that's a tremendous cost savings for us.","I'll now -- I'm going to turn to Slide 11. We've got a lot of detail on this slide showing the recent drilling results in the Wolfcamp Shale horizontal play. I'm certainly not going to read all this data to you, but as I mentioned, we've drilled 27 wells in the southern 200,000 acres, of which 17 are on production, 10 were added during the third quarter. All 17 are shown on the map. Now what we're showing on this map is data pertaining to 24-hour IP rates. That normally would not be what we would do because we really believe that 30-day peak rates are much more indicative of the ultimate well performance. However, the reason we're showing 24-hour IP rates here is -- the fact is, several of these wells, in fact 10 recent wells, haven't been on production long enough to be able to establish a 30-day rate. So we thought the best thing to do at this point is to show 24-hour IPs because it's the only way to have an apples-to-apples comparison of the well results. When you look across the board, most of these wells are drilled in the B zone. Specifically, as you look to the northwest, those are the Giddings  wells. Those are really phenomenally strong wells. In the mix here, we have a predominance of B wells. 15 of the 17 are B wells, but 2 are in the A interval. One of those was drilled in the center part of the map, a very strong well, 585 BOE per day. We also drilled 1 well to the north and east that was actually drilled into a fault. This was a well that was drilled prior to our acquisition of 3-D seismic in the area. And as a result, it was drilled in a location we otherwise would not have drilled had we had the 3-D in advance.","However, having drilled it into a fault, it's really unable to get a substantial frac on this well, and therefore, the results are, as expected, poorer than what you would normally look for out of the A zone. We're very positive on the A zone. In fact, we've got 2 more wells that are actually been drilled and are waiting on a frac. It's probably going to commence very shortly, later this month. And those 2 A wells are showing actually a University of 10, and they'll have about 7,500 foot laterals.","So I can say definitively this drilling has gone exceedingly well. You can tell because if you look at Slide 12 and compare the production from these wells, particularly 12 wells here where we have adequate amount of historical production data, that the wells are doing very well in terms of lining up versus our type curve pertaining to the 575,000 BOE, and this is the oil portion, of course. But the orange line shows these wells that have been on for quite a long time are tracking beautifully with that type curve. Actually, if you look to the green line, these are the 2 Giddings area wells that I mentioned on the prior slide. And one of those wells, the Giddings 2041 has just reached its 1 year anniversary from first production a couple of weeks ago, and it's produced 133,000 BOE. To give you a frame of reference, our typical Wolfberry vertical well would normally make 140,000 BOE in a 40 or plus year period of production. So this bodes well that we really are on the mark in terms of our type curve. The production is coming in very nicely on these wells on average, and we're very pleased to say that the horizontal Wolfcamp play continues to meet our longer-term expectations.","On Slide 13, this is just a depiction of our view that there will be upwards of 5 potential zones in the horizontal Wolfcamp play as we develop the drilling campaign from the A all the way through the D as shown on the log. And you'll see us be drilling 5,000 to 10,000 foot wells in various of these zones as we go forward. We have as yet not even drilled a well into the Wolfcamp C, for instance. And the only Wolfcamp D well we've drilled was in Midland County well over a year ago.","Shown here, the vast majority of the wells are in the B currently, 15 wells currently on production and the 2 A wells I already mentioned having been drilled and ready to be completed shortly. We are also testing for the first time a lower B Wolfcamp well. And we'll -- this is just an example of us continuing to go down the learning curve in terms of all the intervals that we can access in the horizontal Wolfcamp play.","Importantly, we drilled a couple of very highly successful wells in the Jo Mill Sand, which is, as you see on the log, just above the Lower Spraberry Shale. We've drilled thousands of vertical wells of course over the years that drilled through and completed in the Jo Mill, so we have an immense amount of data. These 2 wells were only drilled at roughly 2,500 feet laterals, but they've made excellent rates. And as Scott mentioned, these rates are actually increasing, but over 550 barrels a day on a BOE basis and another one over 300 BOEs per day. So we got some work to do as a result of these successful wells, and that is to pursue an analysis of the well results and what they mean in terms of where we go with the Jo Mill. We're taking core in this well and we'll tie it to petrophysics and we plan 2 additional wells to follow up. It does prove to us though that the area where the vertical wells were drilled, this is in basically northern Upton County, that these vertical wells in the area, were not adequately draining the zone, and that gives us significant running room for the future in terms of Jo Mill horizontals. It's just another example indicating that the Permian Basin horizontal potential is really in the very early stages of understanding in terms of all the various zones for which horizontal drilling will be available.","And in our case, since we control the vast majority of the acreage, it really bodes well for the future of horizontal drilling in the area.","That said, if you turn to Slide 14, you start looking at our production performance in the Permian Basin, you can't forget the contributions from vertical deeper drilling. In fact, about 2\/3 of our wells access resources below the Wolfcamp. And as shown and particularly related to the average IP rates of these wells, that we can add anywhere between 120 and -- have 120 to 180 BOE per day wells versus your typical Wolfcamp completed vertical which make typically 90 barrels a day on IP. So we know we're adding a lot of reserves and a lot of potential to these wells. And perhaps, the deeper drilling can add, in various areas, up to 100,000 BOE above that 140,000 BOE Wolfcamp-related type curve. And vertical drilling is the key to performance.","And if you look at Slide 15, you can see it very clearly. The results we see here are predominantly due to the impact of the deepening and the impact on our overall performance. In fact, we came in at about 69,000 BOE per day in the third quarter and that allows us to tighten our range and actually move it to the top of the range to 67 to 67 -- 66,000 to 67,000 BOE per day for the year. And you can see our fourth quarter range of about 69,000 to 71,000 BOE.","Just a little bit of detail on what happened during the quarter pertaining to the NGL situation. You may recall, we built quite a large inventory of NGLs in the second quarter pertaining to Mont Belvieu fractionation limitations. So in the third quarter, we did draw down about 1,800  barrels a day from that inventory. However, we did have a production loss due to the fact that we had these constraints due to the ethane rejection. As a result of that, we had about 90,000 barrels still in inventory. However, that will be principally offset by the fact that we have line fill requirements for the new Lone Star NGL pipeline, taking our Permian volumes down to Mont Belvieu in the fourth quarter.","The other effect we're seeing is as offset producers and ourselves continue to drill a significant number of wells. We're getting to the point where our Spraberry gas processing facilities are nearing their capacity as we get near the end of this year. And that has an effect to us of actually not causing ethane rejection per se, but reducing recoveries of ethane. Essentially, as the plants get more full, ethane recovery rates go down. In other words, you're just less efficient in the plants. So we're going to lose probably 1,000 to 2,000 BOE per day due to reduced ethane recoveries in the plants. That will be alleviated, of course, as the new driver facility is put in place at the end of the first quarter, early second quarter, another 100 million cubic feet a day capacity adding to the existing 260 million. In addition to that, there's another 100 million a day plant due to be put on production probably in the end of next year or early in the following first quarter. We are running currently 25 vertical rigs.","Turning now to the Eagle Ford Shale, well, suffice it to say, we set a new production record in the third quarter, as Scott already mentioned. On Slide 16, we have a recap of the activity. We drilled 38 wells in the quarter, and put 35 on production. As I mentioned, last quarter, we're back-weighted a little bit this year. We had more wells being put on production in the second half than we did in the first half and that's leading to outstanding production results. And we're on schedule and on pace to drill the 125 wells planned this year, with only a very small handful of those targeting dry gas as expected. We continue to push the envelope in terms of the use of white sand as opposed to more expensive ceramics. In fact, the well results look very strong for the use of white sand and we think we'll continue to push that envelope. We have actually been drilling dry gas wells with white sand as well to help reduce the cost of the wells. And if you look at the net cost savings, it's something like $700,000 to use white sand as opposed to ceramics. So we'll continue to push the technical envelope because of the significance of the cost savings. We're essentially built out with our CGPs. We have a couple more to build next year, but essentially, with 11 online, we've got a great first mover advantage in terms of processing our volumes.","We've also improved efficiencies, if we turn to Slide 17. The depiction here is showing the drilling cost per foot decreasing substantially, in fact, about 18% over the last 5 quarters or so, while at the same time, the drilling feet per day is increasing -- has increased about 28% over the same time period. It goes to show, as we continue to learn more and continue to push efficiencies, that we'll be also hopefully controlling and\/or reducing well costs.","Looking at Slide 18, here's another reason to expect we can do so. In 2012, this year, the predominance of the wells as shown about 70% -- we're drilling primary wells or primary acreage to hold the acreage as we went through the process of drilling to preserve a leasehold that would otherwise expire. We're coming to a close on that as we get to 2013. In fact, next year we'll be about 80% multi-well pad drilling as opposed to single-well drilling up and down the space. And so that's going to give us a tremendous cost savings of probably $600,000 to $700,000 per well going into 2013. That will be somewhat offset by the fact that we probably will be using bigger fracs as we improve efficiencies, as well as increased lateral lengths going forward. And one more additional concept we're using in the field is choke management as shown on Slide 19.","I won't go into all of the details here other than to say you should look at this slide and notice the green line, it's the smallest of the chokes being used and what these lines depict is cumulative production from the wells under different choke sizes. And what you can see is with a 12\/64 choke, the cumulative production crosses over the lines of the larger chokes within about 5 or 6 months. And that has the effect of, I think, increasing longer-term EURs of the wells and does reduce production declines in the wells, especially in the early time frame. And ultimately, what it's doing is sustaining higher wellhead pressure and enabling more stable flow within the well. So this is actually proven, I think, and we'll continue to use choke management to make sure we're improving the EURs of these wells. Ultimately, on Slide 20, it's -- the proof's in the pudding on production and the results of all the efforts of our South Texas team has led to record production in the field. Again, about 29,000 BOE per day during the quarter. And here again, it leads us to move up to the top of the range, the forecast for the year to about 27,000 to 28,000 BOE per day and about 32,000 to 35,000 expected in the fourth quarter.","Well, you can tell how well we're doing just by checking out public data, particularly from IHS. And if you study that data across the whole trend, you can see that the Pioneer wells are exceeding expectations and our strong well performance is one of the reasons this production growth is doing so well. In fact 50% of our wells are in the top quartile of all the wells in terms of EUR drilled in the Eagle Ford Shale. And at the same time, 80% of wells are above the median EUR, the mean, and so this just goes to show that our wells are among the best. We think we're in one of the best areas in the Eagle Ford and that's the reason that these wells are performing so well.","And finally, the last slide for me is Slide 21, it's on Alaska. Our production has done very well. Our N1 well, that was the Nuiqsut well with a mechanically diverted frac from last year, continues to produce well and is leading us to actually have pretty good production results this year from Alaska. We continue with 1 rig on the island. It's drilling Nuiqsut and Torok wells. We're going to follow up that successful mechanically diverted frac-ed Nuiqsut 1 well that was frac-ed last year, with a total of 4 wells to be frac-ed this winter season. 3 of those will be Nuiqsut wells, 1 will be Torok wells. To prove out that, that style of frac actually is the way to go and it will lead to a lot of running room for our Alaska operations. We'll start tracking those wells probably in February or so and will take a couple of months to do that. And as a result, we won't see any results on this until well into the second quarter. But the fact is, I think we're going to have some good success here frac-ing these wells with Lower 48-style completions. We're also in the midst of planning and are ready essentially to drill a second Torok well from the shore. Recall last year, we drilled quite an excellent well from the shore, it exceeded our expectations. And we're drilling an offset to that well this winter and progressing a pending future development from the shore and in the FEED study that's ongoing. We think as a result of the well we drilled last winter, we've added about 50 million barrels of oil or so in terms of resource potential to the Torok.","So it was a great quarter of operation. I give credit to all our operations teams for their performance and particularly a couple of teams we haven't even discussed, that being Raton and West Pan and Hugoton. Those contribute also mightily to strong performance that enabled us to beat our production forecast for the quarter.","With that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich, and he can discuss the third quarter financials and the fourth quarter outlook.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim, I'm going to start on Page 22. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $19 million or $0.15 per share. That did include unrealized mark-to-market derivative losses on an after-tax basis of $146 million or $1.19 and included 2 unusual items, significant items. One, discontinued operations, as you guys are familiar, we did close our South Africa sale in the third quarter, and so this reflects the effects of that during the quarter. We did have, on a pre-tax basis, about $29 million gain on that sale. So the $32 million on an after-tax basis was included in earnings or $0.26 per share. Also, as we talked about -- back in August, we did unwind some 2014 and 2015 gas derivatives. And we also unwound some interest rate swaps so we recognized a gain of $28 million after-tax or $0.23 related to that. So adjusting for the mark-to-market unusual items, we're, on a clean basis, at $104 million or $0.82 per diluted share.","Looking at the box in the middle of page, the guidance, as you recall, included Barnett Shale activity and so we wanted to put it on a comparative basis with actual results. So the middle column there is our results, including Barnett Shale, but excluding the unrealized mark-to-market derivative losses and unusual items.","So Scott and Tim both talked about production did extremely well at 160,000 BOEs a day for the quarter. Production costs above guidance range, I'll talk more about that here in a minute. And then if you look at the rest of the items, for the most part, they're in line with expectations for the quarter -- as we went into the quarter.","Turning to Slide 23, on price realizations. Looking at the bar charts there, you can see oil. We're up 1%, so essentially flat for the quarter. NGLs continue to have weakness, so we were down 5% on the NGL front. And on gas, as you guys have seen the forward curve move up, we're up 30% relative to the second quarter, up $2.62 for realized prices. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the impact of the VPPs. As Scott mentioned, that does go away up to the end of the fourth -- this quarter, so looking forward to that being done and gone and adding the 3500 BOEs a day back into production. And then you can see the impact of derivatives at the bottom as well.","Turning to Slide 24, talking about production costs. Production costs for the quarter were up $1.54 per BOE. It's principally related to lease operating expenses in West Texas. As you guys know, the activity level's high out there, so we have mainly 4 items that impact us for the quarter. Higher salt water disposal costs I'll talk a little bit more about; higher electricity costs associated with the 30% increase in gas prices, which is used for power generation out there; higher repair and maintenance costs for the quarter; and then as Tim talked about the -- on a per BOE basis, losing the 4,000 BOEs per day of sales during the quarter impacted us on a per BOE basis. On the salt water disposal costs, we did have 2 salt water disposals that were hit by lightning during the quarter that caused incremental hauling, which was at a cost as well as incremental third-party disposal costs. And so those have both been fixed and those are behind us. But to further address the growth in the field, we have added 3 new disposals out there during the month of October and we've drilled 6 more disposal wells. They're in various stages of completion, but they should be up and running by the end of this quarter or early in 2013. So that should help bring these costs back to a more normal basis as we move into the first part of next year.","Turning to Slide 25. Guidance for the quarter. All this guidance does exclude Barnett, reflecting discontinued operations. Scott and Tim both talked about daily production for the fourth quarter being 154,000 to 158,000 BOEs per day. Production costs we have moved up the range just to reflect some of those costs will still roll into the fourth quarter before we see less salt water disposal costs going into the second half of the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. The rest of the items here are consistent with past guidance, I'm not going to go through each of those individually, but they're there for your review. And so with that, why don't we open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Looking at the Jo Mills wells that you reported, can you give us any flavor for kind of costs and maybe what you guys are thinking about with respect to IRRs? And then lastly, you made comments about it doesn't seem like that area is depleted from the vertical drilling. If you think about the 800,000 to 900,000 acres you referenced, do you feel confident that, that's something you can deploy across the whole portfolio?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, first of all, on your first question on cost, we've done some work -- of course we had a bunch of science on those first 2 wells as you might expect, so we've done some work to look at normalizing the cost of the wells, excluding science. If we were to be in that 2,500-foot range, I think we would say they would be $4 million to $4.5 million. You start moving them out to 5,000, which I think will be the next wells we drill, will be 5,000-foot wells, they look like they're $5.5 million. In terms of aerial extent, as I mentioned, the Jo Mill is ubiquitous across the play. We need to do a little bit more work of course from a petrophysical standpoint. But what we really need to do is identify the sweet spots. And every shale play, of course, has sweet spots, and it's true of this play as well, although, this is a silty sandy zone, it's surrounded by shales. And so we just need to do some more petrophysics to exactly know where to go and where the sweet spots are going to be. But suffice it to say, since the -- the Jo Mill we've completed several thousand wells. We've got the data. We just need to do the work on it, Dave, to understand exactly where we're going to go with it. But it's a material well, set of wells, considering they came in well above our expectations for 2,500-foot laterals. So we're pretty excited about it.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And just kind of thinking about that relative to the IRRs and the rest of your portfolio, it would seem like, based on those production numbers, that, that would be probably one of the more attractive things you're pursuing right now.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, you'd have to say that, although, I think at this point in time, we'd say we don't have much data, we don't have much time under our belts on these wells. So we really don't have an EUR estimate, and we certainly don't have an EUR estimate pertaining to longer laterals in the Jo Mill. So I mean, on the surface of it, with this kind of production, at least in the early stages, the economics look positive.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then maybe a cleanup question. With respect to the Barnett Combo divestiture in your guidance, you take the production out of your forward forecast, but it doesn't look like CapEx is adjusted for that. When we think about the CapEx increase, am I thinking about that correctly, that CapEx is still in there and it represents maybe what percent of the $100 million?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the CapEx is still in there.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","What percent of the $100 million increase would maybe be captured by that?","Scott D. Sheffield","0. That's all Wolfcamp. $100 million increase, strictly Wolfcamp, primarily.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then just one last cleanup item. With respect to the $7 million well costs you talk about in the Wolfcamp, how does that increase when you start looking at 10,000-foot laterals?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. The $7 million as is depicted on the slide is for a 7,000-foot lateral. I think you get, if you're at 10,000 feet, right in the $8 million to $9 million range, something like that. We're drilling the wells very fast though. As I said, 19 days on a 10,000-foot lateral is pretty impressive. So I think it's a couple of million more once you go out to 10,000 feet.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Cameron Horwitz with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Tim, you guys talked about last quarter on the Wolfcamp, horizontal Wolfcamp, flowing those wells, upcasing before putting on artificial lift. Did you do that with this last batch? And how are you kind of seeing -- are you seeing any kind of early indications there are difference in well performance?","Timothy L. Dove","Right now we're actually focused on one particular style of completion, and that is the 200,000, 250,000 barrels of water, 7 million pounds proppant, 85% Brown sand, blowing the wells up, up tubing, gas lifted. That's basically the style today.","Cameron Horwitz - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then -- I know you briefly touched on it in the Jo Mill formation, but can you give us maybe just a quick compare and contrast on the rock properties there versus what you see in the Wolfcamp?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, again, the Jo Mill, is a sort of sandy, silty zone. It's more of traditional reservoir pay zone as opposed to a shale. What we needed, we've done some microseismic on that well, and it's very clear that the well has access, by virtue of the frac, probably some of these nearby shale zones. We have shale above and below the Jo Mill. We are doing a lot more science to understand that, but I think we're actually accessing reserves in production, not just from the Jo Mill per se, but also from some of the nearby shales. It's going to take us more time to really get our arms around that, but clearly it's a significant resource. As Scott mentioned, the Jo Mill is one of the primary zones in vertical drilling over many, many years. It and the upper Spraberry have over 50% of the well in place in the traditional way the wells used to be drilled. It's a large resource. And what I think we've proven, as I've mentioned, is we really haven't been adequately draining it with 40-acre wells. Now compared to shales, you have much better reservoir rock here. So you're landing the wells in the Jo Mill in the reservoir rock and perhaps -- we're studying this more -- actually accessing some of the shales with the frac.","Operator","We go next to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just question here on, sort of, rig counts. You talked about going down to 25 rigs in the Spraberry vertical program. Is that kind of the spot we would expect it to stay into next year? And I guess you guys talked about going to 7 horizontal rigs in the Wolfcamp by the end of the year. Do you see that increasing further next year? Obviously, it sounds like you're getting ready to get pretty decent cash infusion from the Barnett, as well as the Wolfcamp JV. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you might deploy that money.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, Leo, we're going to wait until we get our answers in December. I've looked at the current whole [ph] strip going into 2013 and forward, and make a final decision on both the horizontal rig count. We would expect the horizontal rig count to be higher than the 7, obviously, with a very successful joint venture. In the horizontal side, we'll have to decide how many horizontal rigs to drill up in Midland and Martin County, where we own 100% of the acreage where we're drilling now based on those tests, and then we'll back into what the vertical program should be. So at this point in time, it could be 25, but we don't know. We'll look at it. We'll announce our CapEx sometime during the first quarter, January or February of 2013.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. In terms of the Gaines well that you guys talked about, it looks like the production performance on those wells extremely strong. Have you guys put out kind of an EUR estimate for what you think the Giddings wells might be? It looks like they've kind of done sort of the 2 best wells in your portfolio there.","Timothy L. Dove","Well, they are excellent wells. I think realizing these wells are only 5,300 feet in terms of lateral length, you have to adjust for what eventually will be drilled in that area, which would be more 7,000-foot plus. But at the 5,300-foot lateral length, these wells look like they're probably 650,000 to 675,000 BOE roughly. And, like I say, I expect to the extent we drill longer laterals, we'll exceed that in that area.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. Kind of a question around the, kind of, senior convert notes that are coming due here. You guys talked about cash payment and then some shares. I just wanted to make sure, so those shares, I think you said it was 3.3 million, those are definitely going to be issued as part of redeeming those notes, is that correct?","Richard P. Dealy","Yes. How the convert works is we would pay the principal amount of notes with cash, which is the $480 million. And then depending on where our stock price trades around the redemption period, we would issue a number of shares and at the 104 level it's about that 3.3 million shares.","Operator","We go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of quick ones hopefully. If I could jump very quickly back to the Jo Mill, what are the implications on the 20-acre downspacing of a successful Jo Mill program? I'm just wondering if it's a trade-off between one and the other. And maybe some cost on those wells would be appreciated.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, Doug -- is that a Scottish accent there?","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm afraid so.","Scott D. Sheffield","Okay. I think if the Jo Mill really plays out like it could, in the horizontal Wolfcamp, then it's going to lead to more horizontal drilling and less vertical drilling over the next 5 to 10 years. So it depends on how massive the Jo Mill horizontal could be. So the question is, we're eventually going to try a horizontal Atoka, we're going to try a horizontal Mississippian, and so the big challenge, can you recover more oil long-term by drilling more horizontal wells? We don't know at this point in time, but it's something that we're going to have to look at. And so we have to be careful of how many vertical locations we drill. We know we can drill them down to 20-acre spacing safely. They're probably only draining about 10-acre spacing. The new Railroad Commission rules allows us a lot of flexibility to drill a maximum number of horizontal wells, but it does impact as we drill the current vertical well program pretty aggressively. It could impact where we put our horizontals if the Jo Mill plays out. So it's just something we're going to have to watch and drill some more Jo Mills like we plan on in 2013.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What was your approximate cost you expect those horizontals to come in at?","Scott D. Sheffield","Tim mentioned they should be around $5 million to $6 million, depending on the horizontal length.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My second question is really kind of a double-edged one, and forgive me for this one, but I'm really interested in your discussion around choke management in the Eagle Ford. You seem to have kind of thrown yourself into the middle of a debate there because some of the, I guess, some of the aggressive operators are running sort of 34. I've seen as high as 40\/64 on their chokes, and the IP rates as pretty impressive. Now you guys are coming out and saying, well, we kind of prefer this approach. Could you maybe just offer some thoughts around that? And if you could layer into that what you're doing in the Wolfcamp by way of choke management. I'll leave it at that.","Timothy L. Dove","I think the difference that we're citing is the fact that we're not really focused on IP rates. Yes, we could flow these wells really hard. We could actually be substantially increasing our current production if we just got off the concept of choke management. We're really more focused on EUR, the long-term performance of the wells. And by virtue of the data that I showed from various wells for which we're comparing choke sizes, we think it's pretty definitive from an empirical standpoint that EURs are positively affected by basically choke management. And I think higher choke sizes has the opposite effect. And so you'll see us continue to do that. We're just not really about IP rates. They really have very little meaning in terms of the ultimate recoveries of the wells.","As to Wolfcamp, generally speaking, we're bringing these wells on with I think 20\/64 chokes. And then we increase them through time. But it's really not a choke management process there as much as it is just basically controlling the flow rates.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Those 3 wells you showed in this presentation, were they all similarly completed in terms of frac stages and so on?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. Essentially, that's the way we do this analysis to make sure that they're essentially completed the same and essentially the same lateral lengths.","Operator","We go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Wolfcamp, the A well that you drilled, how close was the successful well drilled relative to an upper B well? Does the well say anything from the perspective of communication between zones? Or could you talk to at what point you would test an A on top of an upper B or a B -- an upper B on top of a lower B to have confidence there's not communication between the zones?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we haven't done the latter. We have not actually drilled an A on top of a B as we eventually will if you start looking towards the future, where you have stacked laterals. In the area we're drilling the 2 new A wells, we are basically drilling an A and a B within 700 feet of each other, so we'll have a better answer as to whether we see any interference as it relates to those new A and B wells in the north shortly. But it's going to take us, of course, as I mentioned, a few weeks to get that data. But we're just now in the process of developing the concepts of drilling closer stack laterals, and we'll be able to give you a lot more data later. I mean, the fact is we have been spending a lot of money on science, we have a lot of microseismic data from these wells, and that'll be the case going forward on these northern wells. We'll be doing microseismic on those as well. We'll know a lot about frac propagation and potential for any kind of interference issues. There's a theory out there that actually frac-ing the wells and having interference might be a positive actually, but we don't know that yet. But the fact is, we'll be getting more data as we go through time.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in the Eagle Ford, how are you thinking about your activity level into next year based on the efficiency gains that you have gotten, and then the conversations you're having with your JV partner given that the carries are running out?","Timothy L. Dove","We are currently the process of evaluating the budget for 2013. We haven't really determined exactly the number of rigs we're going to use. And as a result, the number of wells, really, dictated by the number of rigs. The fact is, we are getting more efficient. The whole premise of the plan for 2013 is really not based on the number of rigs per se. It's getting the number of wells drilled. I think it's very likely in 2013 we'll get by with less rigs to drill the same number of wells we otherwise had planned. But suffice it to say, that's the subject of our negotiations and discussions with our partner. Those won't be concluded until a little bit later this quarter.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You would expect your net CapEx then to rise given that you've got less JV proceeds coming in next year versus this year with a flat well count?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. The carry is essentially over here at the end of 2012. And so to drill the same number of wells, again, we're focused more on wells than we are on rigs, it's going to be a substantial higher net Pioneer cost. Those dollars are already being spent as we speak, but the vast majority of those are not our dollars. In 2013, we'll be on a more of a JV basis where we'll have spending coming out of the Pioneer account.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then lastly, I know you don't want to put too many specifics on the 2013 program, but can you just talk broadly when you think about where you want your level of spending versus cash flow next year and your expectation for JV proceeds? Do you anticipate any other asset sales of meaning beyond the JV and the Barnett Combo sale, or should we think about any equity as an option next year?","Scott D. Sheffield","The answer to your last question is, as I stated in the last call, is no. And the first part of the question is, the goal is to spend the cash flow with our budget. And look at the proceeds that we anticipate to get from both the down payment, say 25% down on the JV plus the Barnett Shale, and I would anticipate that we would spend a portion of those cash proceeds over and above our cash flow for 2013.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Can you guys put some context around your expectations for the northern side of the Wolfcamp? And should we expect similar results to the Giddings wells adjusted for lateral length? And Scott, before you ask, yes, that's a South Louisiana accent.","Scott D. Sheffield","Both Midland and Martin County look as good as the Giddings area. It's in the center part of the basin, so all of our maps we expect and would hope would be as good as the Giddings area, both in Midland and Martin County, as we drill these wells, both in the Wolfcamp A zone and the Wolfcamp B. And so the depth -- they'll be similar depths, which gives us higher reservoir pressure, which gives us higher recoveries. So that's what we expect, but we won't know until we start producing them, so give us a few weeks to months.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Sure that's understandable. And then moving back down to the south with the various holes you punched around the southern acreage, can you guys just talk a little bit about the variability and whether or not you've -- like you've kind of proven up some core areas, tested the boundaries, et cetera?","Scott D. Sheffield","We haven't -- we just drilled -- I think Tim mentioned that we drilled what we call a couple of rocker B wells, which are the further southeast wells in the joint venture area. They'll be coming on soon, so there'll interesting tests. Most of our acreage is in what we consider the oily area. It's not in the gassy area toward more gassy, where EOG and Approach are. We are planning on some Wolfcamp D -- lower Wolfcamp zones, Wolfcamp D. I think Tim mentioned we'll have a lower, what we call a B3 or Lower Wolfcamp from the upper standpoint. It will be coming on. More A wells will be coming on, and we'll eventually be planning a C well in 2013, so we want to get all 4 zones tested. And obviously the better quality is in the Giddings, but we're still making very, very good wells in the center part of the joint venture and at the bottom of the acreage also.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, let me just comment just briefly on one additional aspect of this and that is, it is a statistical play, so we're really looking at the mean of these wells as opposed to any individual one. But I can tell if you look at the map on Slide 11, you can see that some of the drilling to the very southwest actually has the least amount of production. And actually, that's exactly what we expected. What we're doing is drilling periphery of the acreage in the southwest. We drill actually as far as you can go on our acreage to the southwest. And as expected, the well results aren't quite as good as when you go north of there. And so what we've actually proven is our modeling and mapping is quite accurate in terms of the aerial extent of this play and the prospectivity on our acreage. So I consider that to be a positive that we're at a point where we can actually pretty much delineate the type of expectations from individual wells based on where they're being drilled. That bodes well for the future as we get out of this mode of just preserving leasehold and getting into development drilling, where we can focus on the best areas first.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's good context. Last for me. Just in terms of the processing constraints that you outlined for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year, are we to expect production from that area to continue to grow, or do you think that's going to be limiting in terms of your ability to grow at least through the first quarter?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we have, clearly, a lot of activity in the basin. That's led to these facilities getting closer to capacity. I think the fact is, as we get into the winter period, we do burn gas in the field for heating. And so I anticipate we have any kind of a decent winter, we're really not going to have a situation in which we have any kind of constraints that are all that significant. If we didn't have a very cold winter out in the West Texas area, it might be more of an issue. But I think what it will be -- we can cram more gas into the system. The real issue is as we do so, we get less efficient and we'll have lesser ethane recoveries. This is a marginal problem. We get recoveries in that plant typically at 65% or so. So they'll be moving down perhaps to 55% or 50% in the case of more capacity being eaten up by additional gas. But this is really just a marginal issue, and it could actually be alleviated by a cold winter. We'll have to see how that goes.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Going back to the Jo Mill, I think you guys touched on this a bit. But it sounds like those wells may have been just recently completed because the oil rate is still on the way up. Do you have a view that you'd care to share on where you think that peak 24-hour IP is going to go?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we are moving lots of water also, load water. Tim didn't mention I think there, they did have smaller frac jobs in these but we are producing a lot of load water, and so we're not pumping -- well, I guess they're not -- based on the current choke size, we just can't get the system unloaded, so they're continue to increase, the total fluid continues to increase. So it's going to take a while, probably another several weeks just to watch it. So they've only been on about 2 or 3 weeks.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. That's the color. But you don't have a sense on whether those oil rates are going to go up by another 50% or anything like that?","Scott D. Sheffield","Just a week ago, the 550 well was down about 300, so it's climbed up pretty good in the last just 7 to 10 days.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","That's really impressive. What -- how much frac stages did you guys do on those wells?","Timothy L. Dove","Those are basically each 15 stages or so. We're pumping 2.5 million to 3 million pounds of proppant and only about 40,000 barrels of water. So this is a lot smaller frac jobs by design in the early stage of these wells, as we're trying to understand how the fracs propagate. But I think it could easily be the case as we get out to 5,000-foot wells, you're going to get into the 30, 35 stages, and we could actually get it to where these are drilled and completed similarly to the Wolfcamp wells that we're doing in the south potentially.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Well, that's all very tantalizing. And do you have -- I realize this may be getting a little too far ahead. I know Scott mentioned that you're going to try horizontals in some of those deeper zones like the Strawn, Atoka and the Mississippian, but do you have, kind of, a next candidate for one of the traditional field pays that you're going to try with a horizontal like maybe in Upper Spraberry or something like that?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, right now, we're just getting our handle in looking at the science, doing more geological work. And then we'll plan a couple more longer Jo Mill wells next year would be the next step. Nothing planned right now in the Upper.","Timothy L. Dove","I will tell you, Charles, as you look at the logs though in the Spraberry field area, there are quite a large number of targets that are actually shales that look nearly as good as the Wolfcamp within the Spraberry section itself. So I wouldn't put it past us, at some point, to test those, just not in the current plan.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then last question. I think this will be a quick one. Is the -- as you have more ethane rejection going on, is it reasonable for us to expect the NGL price realization to move up a bit relative to benchmarks because the residual stream is more biased to the heavy end? Or is that not something that we should expect?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think you're still seeing a lot of drilling out here, and we're producing more ethane every day with these wells. And so the amount of ethane -- this isn't rejection per se it was referring to, it's really recovery rate -- is really not that significant compared to the new ethane being brought on production, whether it's in the Permian or the Eagle Ford or other fields, ethane production is definitely on the incline, so I don't necessarily link what's happening here at all to higher ethane prices for sure.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Eli Kantor with Iberia Capital Partners.","Eli J. Kantor - Iberia Capital Partners, Research Division","I was hoping to get a little bit more color on your Permian opportunity set. You talked about 24,000 gross vertical locations in the past. When should we expect to hear a horizontal Wolfcamp count? And I want to make sure that I understand your commentary earlier correct in that you don't expect any kind of degradation in the vertical inventory as you shift towards horizontal development, is that correct?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. On your first part of the question, we have. If you look at our total proved resource potential slide, we show the horizontal Wolfcamp 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 8,000 locations. And that's only giving credit for about 400,000 acres of our total of 900,000 acres. And so depending on what the 2 wells do in Midland County, those 2 wells at Midland County that we're drilling and competing soon, if they prove up, then we'll be substantially increasing that along with the Martin County wells. And the second part of your question was?","Timothy L. Dove","The effective vertical wells, the horizontals.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Right now, we're still carrying -- is it 25,000?","Timothy L. Dove","23,000, yes.","Scott D. Sheffield","23,000 vertical locations. Right now, we are -- and that's high-graded substantially. Right now, we do not -- I mentioned long term. We could look at potentially the more we add on horizontal, reducing the vertical, but right now, we feel like they're very, very economical. We just have to be able to lay out a vertical and horizontal drilling program. If it turns out we're drilling 4 to 5 in the horizontal Wolfcamp, and we're drilling in the Atoka, we're drilling in the Mississippian, we're drilling a horizontal in the Jo Mill. And so the more you develop these resources horizontal, it'll lend to potentially reducing the vertical program over the next 5 to 10 years.","Eli J. Kantor - Iberia Capital Partners, Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of your Northern Wolfcamp delineation activity, how many results should we expect on the Q4 call? And are you going to be testing both the A and the B zones, did I hear that correctly?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, the first of the wells has been drilled. It's an A zone well. The second is a B -- sorry, I got those mixed up last time, too. The first is a B zone well, the second is an A zone well. Those are just in the process shortly here to be completed and they'll be put on production. So we will clearly have data on those 2 for the fourth quarter call. At which point we move to Martin County, start doing some drilling up there, but to the extent that you sort of roll the clock forward, we'll have very little to talk about in terms of production from those wells by the time we get to early February just because of the time required to get them on production and see some production results. So most likely, it's going to be the 2 Midland County wells. Needless to say, it'll be questionable how much data we'll really have on the Martin County wells.","Eli J. Kantor - Iberia Capital Partners, Research Division","Okay, great. And in terms of your oil field services and equipment that you have in the basin, again, as activity shifts from vertical development to horizontal development, how much of your oil field services need can be met with the 15 rigs you have in-house, the frac fleets that you have in-house, and how much will be fulfilled by third parties?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, right now, at our current rig count in the Permian basin, we're using 100% Pioneer green. And as long as we just continue at the current rig count, that would be the case. We can also accommodate the additional 3 or 4 horizontal rigs that I mentioned coming on with our existing equipment. If we were to get into a JV case that went to 15 or 20 rigs and a substantial northern campaign, we'd probably need more, and we'd probably bring in some outside services at that point. But for right now, our internal equipment is sufficing.","Eli J. Kantor - Iberia Capital Partners, Research Division","Got it. Last question for me is on the horizontal Spraberry activity in the Jo Mill. How big of a program do you expect to have in the fourth quarter in 2013?","Timothy L. Dove","Right now, we're evaluating 2 wells, and we're doing a bunch of science work, as I mentioned, in terms of petrophysics. And we actually got cores being evaluated. So we have a plan to drill a couple of wells early next year in the Jo Mill following up on these 2, probably in a different area and probably with a longer lateral length. But to say more than that in terms of activity, we really aren't going to chart out significant activity changes until we understand from several wells what the productivity of these are going to be.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Sven Del Pozzo with IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Basically, just got real couple of short ones. Relative to what you were saying before about being able to save on completed well costs by not doing as much R&D work for your horizontal Wolfcamp. Could you just help me to understand in layman's terms what you can afford to not do in your development-mode wells on a risk-adjusted basis that would make you feel comfortable with going into development mode without spending that extra money for, say, cores and correlational logs on the cores and so forth that you understand better than I do anyway?","Timothy L. Dove","I don't know about that, Sven, but I will tell you that as we now are in the process of finding out more and more about the different zones we're drilling, and that would include going into C drilling, into D bench drilling, upper and lower Bs, I think we're finding we have to do more science than less as we understand the productivity from those different zones. That's certainly true as you go into Jo Mill or you go into Atoka horizontal. You're going to be doing science on all of these wells, and you have to, to be able to understand where we're going with regard to how these wells are going to get completed, how the fractures are propagated and so on. But suffice it to say, at a minimum, we put $2 million extra into these wells. And the way you compute that is about $700,000 additional drilling costs, principally related to pilot hole drilling; about $500,000 for coring typically; and then about $400,000 for both microseismic and the more sophisticated logs suites. So when you're all said and done, it's a minimum of $2 million that we spend to make sure we learn what we need to about rock qualities and understanding where to go with the development.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And when you say moving into development mode, maybe I'm thinking that within localized areas or once you discover those sweet spots of which we already have a couple. It wouldn't be going into development mode everywhere, it would just be on an area-by-area basis across your large acreage position, where you might be drilling pilots at the beginning and then moving into a development mode in that localized area, is that fair to say?","Timothy L. Dove","That's exactly the way to think about it. There's science wells in various locations of the field because recognizing these shale plays aren't ubiquitous in terms of the quality of the rock and\/or the performance. And so we do microseismic work, we do quarrying and so on to understand the rock qualities in specific areas. Once we understand that and we can tie it to the other data we have, then we're sort of done in terms of science, and we can get off into development drilling. So you're exactly right. We have to have science wells in roughly each of the different areas where we're drilling to get a handle on these properties.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And just more macro basis for the basin as a whole, the Midland Basin. You're seeing some Cline shale positive wells coming in Central Eastern Glasscock County then even other operators even farther north. I guess right now, are you informed enough to say anything about whether the clients also are going to work on your acreage? Or just overall, how come most of the industry operators have drilled mostly these B laterals so far in the southern Midland Basin, and we've seen more Cline activity to the northeast of you and also directly north?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, Sven. Our data shows that the most oil in place is in the A and the B zones. That's why we're focused on the A and B zones. The D is very prospective, but it's probably about half the amount of oil in place as the A and the B. So we're focused on the A and the B. We'll eventually drill D wells. As you move east, where you're discussing, the people are completing D wells. The A and B goes down significantly based on our data points. And so they only have the Wolfcamp D to go after, and they're making, looks like, some pretty good wells. So we'll eventually drill some D wells, but right now the A and B has so much more oil in place, and that's why we're focused on the A and the B.","Timothy L. Dove","Now you'll recall, Sven, we drilled a D zone well at Cline well effectively in Midland County a couple of years ago now, it seems like. And the well seemed to be a disappointment. It made 250 barrels a day on a very small lateral, about 40,000-foot lateral. So you look back on that, we've somewhat proved up to be in Midland County just by virtue of that well. Now then we'd have to come back and drill longer laterals and prove it up from the current style of completions, but that's definitely encouraging.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And just finally, I can even send an email for this one, but were there any sales proceeds in the third quarter that came through?","Richard P. Dealy","Yes, we had -- in our unusual items, we had the closure of the South Africa transaction. And we closed on a small piece of land in Alaska that we called in our unusual items.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Can you give me a rough estimate of what the net sales proceeds were from that?","Richard P. Dealy","Yes. The net cash for South Africa was around $16 million after the -- we'd gotten the cash flow for the most part of the year. And on the Alaska one, it's around $10 million.","Operator","And we go next to Gordon Douthat from Wells Fargo.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions from me. First, as you ramp up horizontal drilling, to what extent do you have 3-D seismic coverage across your acreage?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we're shooting 3-D, as we speak, in the south still. We'd probably have that done early next year and have most of the area covered. A lot of areas to the north we already have 3-D.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. And then one last question for me. You kind of hinted at this early in one of your responses earlier, but just want to make sure. As you get down to 25 rigs in the Spraberry, the vertical rigs, and looking at your location count in that play with 4,700 PUDs booked, how do you think about those PUDs with the 5-year rule, recognizing that you're also picking up some of the deeper zones now and you're drilling a lot bigger wells with the horizontal wells? How do you think about all those factors as we look into reserves coming -- head into year end?","Scott D. Sheffield","E","Yes, we'll just have to, over the next 5 years, manage the ones we are adding deeper rights in several key areas on the vertical program. So that allows us, by adding those zones, to -- if we do lose them, we can rebook them at some point in time, if you add deep rights as we co-mingle with the deeper zones such as the Strawn, Atoka. So we're doing some of that. And if we lose any because of the 5-year rule, then we just got to replace them with all the horizontal wells that we're drilling which has a much, much bigger impact.","Timothy L. Dove","The way I would look at that also is, I mean, these reserves we're talking about here are essentially 0 risk, and they're essentially proved technically. So the 5-year rule really has nothing to do with how proved the wells will be. They are already proved technically. So that's just another insight, I think.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as far as the deep rights go, is it your intent to cover your -- to scoop up all those where you don't have them?","Scott D. Sheffield","We've gone -- from the last 3 to 5 years, we've gone from 50% up to about 80%. And so we like to try to get it higher and higher, the entire position.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Sheffield, I will now turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again thanks for all the interest. We're looking forward to the next quarter. We hope everybody has a great holiday. And again, our hearts and prayers are for the ones up in the Northeast. Hope all goes well with you and your families. Again, thank you very much.","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference.

After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will discuss our 2016 capital program and provide more color on our production forecast for 2020.","He will also provide an overview of our recently announced Midland Basin Acreage acquisition from Devon and review our continuing strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency improvements in this Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. Rich will then cover the second quarter financials and provide the earnings guidance for the third quarter and after that, we'll open up the call as always do for your questions.","So with that I'll turn the call over Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. This is the first call since my announcement to retire as CEO, I want to give you few comments before I go over the first two slides. I\u2019m maybe setting a record but I am getting close to 100 earnings calls since 1991. So 25 years of earnings times four, it\u2019s about 100 years with one left. I think here to be a leader wants to retire and pick the best time, I thought that 2014 was that time. But seeing what the company has done to this is downturn last two years 2016 is obviously the best time.","The company has the best rocks, deepest inventory with the lowest cost basis in the industry, the best balance sheet, what is more important with Tim and the management team is been with me over 20 years. We got the best management team in a bit I'll make a few comments on the best long-term growth profile of any large GAAP company out there.","I have only got a couple of slides as I transition to Tim, so can we turn off with slide number three. With the quarter the company had adjusted loss of $37 million or $0.22 per diluted share, production way above guidance, second quarter was 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 58% oil that\u2019s up from 55% oil in the first quarter. Again, above the guidance an increase of 11,000 barrels per day or 5% versus first quarter, oil production up 12,000 barrels per day or 10% versus first quarter 2016.","Growth driven by the Spraberry Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. We placed 69 wells on production in that field to the second quarter with continuing strong performance, 37 of those wells benefited from the version 3.0 completion optimization. Continuing to see and realize significant capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, longer lateral lengths, greater optimization program, continuing to enhance well productivity. Continuing to see cost coming down on per lateral foot, which Tim will talk about.","Again, a great achievement, we are continuing to see production cost per BOE by 26% from first half of 2015 to first half of 2016. You will see Rich talk more about it and also Tim, but what is an amazing to me is that the horizontal well operating cost excluding taxes is down to almost $2 per BOE. So definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has.","A lot people are asking why with the deep inventory, why we acquiring 28,000 net acres in the Midland Basin from Devon for $435 million. It's simply, because it's totally integrated among our acreage. We did not want somebody to come in. The most competition couldn\u2019t bid on this, because it couldn\u2019t give longer laterals.","We had it totally surrounded, allocated 14,000 per acre and what is the interesting right after we've made the announcement on the acquisition somebody is paying 58,000 per acre right next to this acreage. Closing expected in third quarter and you will see from the slides, this is the best area in our horizontal being Wolfcamp area, wells will be between $1.5 and $2 million BOEs.","Going to slide number four, the company plans to increase its source horizontal rig count as we announced already from 12 to 17 rigs in the Northern second half of 2016. First rig in September followed by two rigs in October and two more rigs in November. Three of those rigs would be dedicated to Sale Ranch area, once locations are permitted.","We already talked about the slight increase in capital expenditures about a $100 million to $2.1 billion, and again obviously is it takes us to 125 to 135 days to bring wells on. Production, we won\u2019t see any production until 2017. But we\u2019re increasing our 2016 production forecast from 6% to 12% to 13% plus. At the end, due to higher forecasted growth rates from the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp well productivity.","The 2017 rig activity is expected to deliver production growth ranging from 13% to 17% in 2017. Again funded by our strong investment grade and really to bet balance sheet in the industry, a strong derivative position and forecasting cash flow assuming mid July strip prices.","Just last comment, before I turn it over to Tim, is probably what is most important in this whole slide deck. The Company expects deliver compounding your production growth of 15% and maintain debt to operating cash flow below one to 2020 and mid July strip prices. And what is most important that the strip price is at 2017 or 2020 has only dropped about $2 to $3. So what has happened obviously the front month has dropped about $10 from $51, $52 down to $42.","So obviously we could ask all the time do we have any plans to reduce our rig activity? The answer is no. This long-term forecast is version 2.0, so it doesn\u2019t have any upside from 3.0, doesn\u2019t have any upside for further cost reductions or optimization improvements. And even though we could talk about it, but the company is well on his way to grow on 15% well past 2020.","We expect to spend within cash flow in this plan, once oil prices gets to $55,that could be in 2017, it could be in 2018, could be in 2019 , we are using 2018 here. That\u2019s also what is amazing for me. So I prefer long-term that the strips stays where it is. Somewhere in the $50 to $55 this pioneer and outperform every indefinite, especially the large cap.","I\u2019m going to now turning it over to Tim to give you more detail on the CapEx.","Timothy Dove","Thanks Scott and I\u2019m turning now to Slide five, the capital spending program for this year, remains intact, as Scott already mentioned we did have to increment the D&C component to $2.1 billion another $100 million or so to account for the five rigs or so that are going to added here in the second half for the year.","Pad drilling as he mentioned, will have the effect of having, this is not impacting 2016 production but rather it will start to come into 2017 and when we add new production from these rigs. Essentially rather than going to the details in the slide, I would simply say all other capital item remain essentially same for the year and they are easily funded by our cash on hand and improving operating cash flow as we see commodities improve from here on now.","Turning to Slide six, we\u2019ve updated our production guidance going forward that really simply reflects several consecutive quarters of outstanding performance from the wells and this is the third in a row, I think we could say so. Looking first at all the quarter, as Scott already mentioned we substantially beat our production guidance range at 233,000 BOE a day or so. And the result of that of course is bumping the year total production right up to about 231,000 BOE per day.","Again just tweaking it up, by virtue of the most recent results. Third quarter we see essentially flat or slightly up in terms of production. There is a lot of mechanical reasons for that, but some of them have to the fact were are going to lower the number of wells we put on production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter just by virtue of the schedule. We are currently planning to pop 50 wells in the third quarter versus 69 in the second quarter.","And we have a larger number of offset wells in this particular upcoming quarter that it will be shut in waiting while we are fracking nearby wells and had been the case in the second quarter. And then in addition to which we are seeing longer periods of utilizing chokes to reduce water flows in the early life of the wells to make sure we don\u2019t over burden our facilities. All those were just coming in 2016s thirds quarter, 2016s fourth quarter looks extremely strong. So this gives simply a scheduling related matter that has this effect.","Finally, as a result of what Scott has mentioned with the five rigs that we are adding and if those are maintained through the balance of 2017 that will yield a growth range of 13% to 17%. And finally if you look at the most right hand bar, our internal data shows that we can generate that 15% CAGR just by adding a few rigs per year or over the period 2018 through 2020.","And as he mentioned, it does not include anything other than version 2.0 completions and does not include anything in terms of further efficiency improvements. I think this growth trajectory is very doable from the operational standpoint and we plan to execute accordingly.","Turning out to Slide seven, the recently announced acquisition I feel like is very opportunistic and has the effect of further high grading our portfolio with some of the best acreage in the Midland Basin. 28,000 acres or so in the Midland Basin, our associates are spread from Sale Ranch all the way down into Northern Upton County, but the main focus and the main reason to do this was focused on the Sale Ranch acreage, where we are adding about 15,000 acres as shown on the map in the black circle.","This is the area we've drilled essentially our most productive Wolfcamp B wells. You can go out on the railroad commission site and find this out for yourself, but this is where we've made really simply outstanding, I have got a graph to show you the results of those wells coming up. And what this transaction does is, it adds 70 long laterals in the Wolfcamp B at high working interest, each of those we feel like based on where the return metrics look today at $10 million with an NPV. So right there that translates into $700 million of value just in drilling those locations, which goes show you I feel like economics of this transaction are really outstanding.","It also adds other locations about 80 Wolfcamp B locations, but have lower laterals length and a lower working interest, we need to go to work on these areas by acquiring additional interest as well as potentially trading acreage to increase the length of those laterals, but we've been very successful on that and would expect to be successful going into the future.","The 13,000 acres principally you see in the south would be used as trades to further consolidate our own acreage and allow longer laterals to be drilled, but people do ask us all the time does this transaction is signal so we might do more of this type of transactions. And the first thing I would say is opportunities like this don\u2019t come around very often that would accrete value to our existing portfolio of acreage.","However, you never say never, but the more frequent deals you will see us doing will involve the trading and consolidation of the acreage that I mentioned a minute ago in order to drill longer laterals. In fact, since early part of 2015 we've traded 19,000 gross acres and have a required $3.2 million growth lateral length in terms of feet for no cash exchanging hands. And so this is where there is huge value added and you will see us continue to be heavily focused on improving our lateral lengths by virtue of these trades.","Going to Slide eight, this is the Sale Ranch data, I mentioned a minute go across all of our acreage of course continuing to build on our success when it comes to completion optimization, but first to the Sale Ranch this is the main focus of course of the Devon transaction. Overtime in this area of the field we have placed 41 Wolfcamp B wells on production that\u2019s over the last two years, that\u2019s wells that are over 7000 feet.","The graphs kind of show the performance of these wells. The first 16 or so wells were almost all version 1.0 completions and you can see that they in the grey line R&D above the 1 million barrel type curve, but not significantly. It's when you start looking at the 23 wells performance in the blue or we start to see the benefits of optimization. Many of these wells that of the 23 were subject to version 2.0 completion. And you can see as a results, these wells on average are exceeding that million barrels type curve by about 60%.","And finally, when you look at the most recent long lateral wells, these are wells that are on average 11,000 to 13,000 feet in terms of lateral length, these are phenomenal wells. We only have two of those wells currently on production, but nonetheless you are looking at wells that look like they are about 2 million barrel wells at least in terms of early stage production.","So I think we are very confident in this year and we have drilled a lot of wells in the area and that\u2019s why we think the Devon transaction accrete such great value to us. And as we learned and continue to refine this completion optimization in the area I think this Sale Ranch acre is expected to show very strong results going forward.","Turn on Slide nine, this is more granularity, especially on competition optimization. In the Wolfcamp B this is both in the North and the South. You will noticed that the graph shows some early results about three months of results are so on version 3.0. First in the North, at the top part of the slide you can see that we had about 14 wells that were subjected to version 3.0 style competitions.","The first 45 days are so of that data really needs to be tossed out as NA, simply because during the period of our choke management. It's not unusual now to have some wells choked for two months. Just as we wait the ability to handle these significantly increase volume of water being pumped into these wells. But if you take a look at the version 2.0 results, they are outstanding course probably 35% improvement over the million barrel type curve.","But we are looking forward to see the fruition of all the version 3.0 wells. You can see we have had wells on improving on production. Only on production without being choked back for about a months. So they are starting to show results that exceed the 2.0, which is what we expect and those results I feel like are encouraging so far. You have to stay tune as we get more data over the next couple of quarters.","We are seeing similar results in the southern JV area. Where you have a mix again of version 2.0 and 3.0 wells and the graphs look essential the same. We don\u2019t see quite as much pick here in the version 2.0 case of about 25% in the South, just a product of less pressure as further you go to South.","But nonetheless we still are encouraged as we look at the 3.0 line again a situation where the early part of the well was choked that we were now starting to see peaking above the 2.0 line and we will be really interested to see how this works out. But I think we will know a lot more over the next couple of quarters about what version 3.0 can attribute, on a per well basis, but sufficed to see these early results are positive.","Now turning to Slide 10, here we\u2019re talking about completion optimization in the Wolfcamp A. The Wolfcamp A verses is a zone which have not drilled nearly the same number with a large sample size of wells compared to the B, but we\u2019re showing similar style results. Wolfcamp A early day 2.0 wells now after having been on productions, in some cases almost as long as a year, they have showed about 25% productivity improvement.","While the 3.0 wells are in a similar position, as we seen in the Wolfcamp B that is early days, just completing their choke management period. In the Southern Wolfcamp areas there is only the one well drilled, you can see it looks like a roughly 1 million BOE type curve, we have not yet done any 3.0 style wells in the South for the Wolfcamp A.","But based on all these results that we've began the see for revision 3.0, we\u2019re evaluating whether to expand the current 80 well campaign to a larger of number wells as we add rigs here in the later part of the year into the next year. We will be getting back to you with more details on exactly how many wells we are expand that to as the team completes their work.","Turning to Slide 11, this is lowest grade rate shale data, just to update you on that. You can see that all 24 wells are show and drilled with 2.0 versions style completions. They still show about a 10% improvement over the one million BOE type curve. I think the take away from all of these slides are significant in the sense that we now have a 150 wells with version 2.0 data and we can pretty definitely say, that\u2019s going to be the new style of completion at a minimum.","We have this 80 well campaign going 37 of the wells of the 80 are on production, with various styles of version 3.0 optimization. They are looking good, but we have to cease more time before we can really tell you definitively how good they are going be.","Choke management occurs, still impinges upon our ability to see early well production results. But I think is the case that not only will we put the 43 additional wells on, using 3.0, but we\u2019ll look at actually increasing the size of that campaign as we get into the later part of this year and to next year.","Slide 12 turning to cost efficiency, Scott covered some of this but I'll try to be brief with it, but sufficed to say that even with more sophisticated and costly completions because of going from version 2.0 to 3.0 during this time period, where the cost are higher as a result for that. we have continued to more than offset that cost increase and continue to drive down overall D&C cost.","You see year here over the last year and half or so, the 35% decrease in our D&C cost, despite effect that we\u2019re adding costs, and that\u2019s not in significant cost when we\u2019re doing version 2.0 and 3.0 completions. There are lot of reasons for that. You may recall last year, we ended the contract for both our tubular and cement pricing, substantial reduction this year, probably 30% to 35% reductions.","We also see continual completion efficiency gains, one way to do that is to reduce our non-productive time where we just simply reduced the number of days on the job and that reduces all of the cost that are driven by time, including things like rentals, supervision and labor.","So we are seeing a lot of improvements when it comes to that period of the business as well, but we have room for further improvement. Our rig rates today are still based on the old contract rates that will start peeling off as we get into the 2017 and 2018 where we can then expect to see spot rates for rigs, which we have been waiting for some time.","I'm going to turn now to Slide 13 to give you some details regarding the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp drilling campaign, as it proceeds, it's really on pace other than for the adding of the fiver rigs coming up here in the next few months, we expect to place 230 wells on production. You can see the splits there, it\u2019s still predominantly Wolfcamp B and to a lesser extent Wolfcamp A.","We believe as I mentioned that the 2.0 style completion is now essentially the standard design, but you will know a lot more about 3.0 as we go, but we reduced our D&C cost about $7 million that's assuming a 9,000 foot lateral and the combination of the new completion techniques. Really importantly and Scott alluded to this is our production cost per horizontal well is really coming down nicely. Even in the last quarter we were talking about this ranging from $5 to $7 per BOE, which includes both LOE and taxes.","Now we see that its $4 to $6 per BOE and this is a product of gas lift being used in most wells and doing a lot of work in terms of centralizing maintenance and reducing labor cost. The results of which is very high IRRs, even though we are in this price deck that we face, in this case 50s low 50s and in past really in the low 3s.","But the fact we haven\u2019t been able to reduce our cost and improve our efficiency to the point, but these wells still are highly economic and I think we would say that to the extent that we get upside on version 3.0 and\/or any improvement in commodity prices those returns only improve.","Turning to Slide 14, it's my last slide. This is a slide show on how all this translates into production growth. We did have a tremendously good second quarter. This is just specifically Permian Bain 167,000 BOE per day that allows us to bump the whole year up to an average of 168 despite virtue of that early good performance did put 69 wells on production, but the vast majority on the Northern area we are completing on the Southern area wells.","We will have those mostly done in this quarter, and we did complete more wells ahead the plan and pushing some completions from the third quarter into the second quarter that number is lower as we get into the third quarter as I mentioned about 50 wells to be put on production.","And then to the extent that we have shutting volumes from offset fracs is where we shut in wells next door to wells being completed. That number is going to be about 35% higher as estimated compared to the second quarter. All those lead to notion that the third quarter would be more flattish than we would have expected compare to the second quarter. But it has to do with all these reasons including the curtailment of the wells with choke management.","So overall, I would say this was a very strong quarter operationally and I think just as a thing as going forward as we shift to see outstanding results from these assets in the future. And with that, I'm going to pass it over too Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and the third quarter outlook.","Richard Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 15. Where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $268 million or $1.63 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher commodity prices at the end of June versus at the end of the first quarter. So those losses after tax basis totaled $231 million or $1.41 per share.","So after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses we are at $37 million loss for the quarter or $0.22. If you look at the middle of the page where we show the results for the quarter versus or guidance, you are going to see that production as Tim and Scott mentioned was very positive. Our cost initiatives are bearing fruit and coming down. So we are on the positive side of the guidance and a number of these things are within the guidance. So really, an overall exceptional quarter financially, one of the point to mention is we have just under $410 million of operating cash flow for the quarter as well.","Turning to Slide 16, look at our price realizations on the bars there you can see that oil prices were up 47% to $41.43 for the quarter, albeit a low reference point for the first quarter. NGL prices were up 38% to $14.21 per barrel primarily with higher ethane and propane prices that we expensed during the quarter. And then if you look at gas prices, they were down 7% although we did see gas prices jump towards the end of the second quarter. So we hope that third quarter will better than the first and second quarter.","If you look at our oil price differential for the quarter it was down $1.21 from where we were in the first quarter, that\u2019s really from the two things. I think we mentioned these in on the first quarter call, was one, our Eagle Ford condensate contract, we had new contract. It was effective April 1, so that reduced our differential on eagle Ford condensate, so that helped on that front and we also saw tighter Midland cushion differentials for the quarter.","Looking down to the bottom, you can see the impact of our derivatives, we still had a great quarter from a derivative standpoint, $132 million added in cash flow during Q2 form derivatives and brings our total to $349 million through the first six months for the year.","Turning Slide 17, look at production cost. Once again, Tim talked about it, but the assets teams are really doing a great job on lowering our cost structure and improving our margins. You can see there in the second quarter our production cost per BOE are 9% from the first quarter, base LOE was down about 5%.","Centralizing our maintenance, the cost initiatives of the asset teams have going on, reducing our salt water disposal handling costs, labor cost were down as we are really covering the increased activity with the same headcount. We are using gas lift versus electricity or submersible pumps to support our wells and lower fuel and electric cost as well.","The other thing that you will notice here is when you look at our third-party transportation cost on a per BOE basis, those were down really due to our decline in Eagle Ford production, which is the bulk of our transportation cost. And so on our weighted average basis as the company continues to drilling and it becomes a smaller portion if it, you will see that go down on a per BOE basis.","And then probably lastly as Tim also talked about with the Spraberry horizontal Wolfcamp wells coming in and they are low operating cost $2 to $4 before taxes, and $4 to $6 in total on a more weighted average basis and our production cost will continue to benefit from those well as we add more of that production in the future.","Turning to Slide 18, it really sums up the last two slides from a margin standpoint. A new slide that we have added. It really highlights why we had 90% of our capital budget focused on the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, and why we are comfortable adding rigs going into the future and its really tremendous that its cash margin in the premier horizontals are more than twice any of other assets and the low operating cost that Scott talked about really just drives the great returns that we can generate from these assets.","Turning to Slide 19, look at our liquidity position, excellent position, probably we are the best in the industry today with the net debt at the end of quarter of $300 million and undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had net debt to forecasted cash flow and 0.2 times. So just a terrific financial situation for the company as we continue to invest in these horizontal wells to grow our production and generate great returns.","You look at the timeline in the middle there, you will see the 2016 debt maturity that it was actually due in mid July, so that was paid with cash on hand. We also have their maturity that\u2019s due in March of 2017 and then also was free funded with the bond offering we did last December and we paid-off it with cash on hand as well.","Turning to Slide 20 and really focused on third quarter guidance, daily production 232,000 to 237,000 BOE, as Tim just recently talked about. It is primarily flattish for the quarter up a little bit, due to the reduced wells that we are going to place on production during the quarter and offset wells, they will be shut in as we frac those wells during the quarter.","Production cost of $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE really reflects the lower run rate and the effort to the asset teams to continue bring those cost down. The rest of the guidance is consistent with second quarter results and prior quarter guidance. So won\u2019t go through those in detail, but they are there for your review.","And so with that, Rachel we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","On the big cost reductions that you all had during the quarter despite the bigger completion jobs that you are doing, you mentioned some of the things that drove that in terms of efficiency gains and just some less downtime. But anything specific that you could point to make just such a meaningful change in just a quarter?","Scott Sheffield","Well, of course we are seeing John, some of the cumulative effect of things we have done in the past as well. In other words, we\u2019re just now to the point where we would say we\u2019re full run rate at lower tubular cost, as well as cement cost I mentioned, of course it took us a while to burn off inventory from what we had at the end of the last year.","So now we are at a run rate, which just reflective of spot pricing, which is very low compared to last year, but there is really a lot more of the same as what already captured it. I know that we very substantially reduced our non-productive time completions, which as I mentioned, I think our non-productive time was down about 52% in this particular quarter and it has to do with all aspects of the completion.","So it has to do with reducing time on the wire line as an example, reducing mechanical failures where we can, and when you start reducing non productive time, that substantially has a very positive effect on things that we get charged on a daily rental basis.","And for that matter its supervision, the job is on, you don\u2019t need labor out there, you don\u2019t need any transport, you don\u2019t need a lot of things for as many days as you did before. So those are very much cumulative effects and then in essence what happens is, they just have the effective offsetting the fact that completions are more expensive.","John Freeman","Great. And then my follow up question, when you talk about the 2017 and the longer-term guidance, and you mentioned that it basically reflects like the 2.0 Version but not Version 3.0, I'm just curious. Like when I look at like the Version 2.0 impact on the Wolfcamp A and B, kind of 25% to 35% improvement over the type curve, does the longer-term guidance like fully reflect 2.0? Is it some sort of a risk kind of case of what you have seen on the 2.0? Is there still some additional upside just based on what you are already seeing on 2.0 before we even talk about Version 3.0?","Frank Hopkins","Hey John, this is Frank. I'll try to answer that for you. I think it's fair to say that it is in that 25% to 35% range, but we tend to be conservative particularly in areas where we haven\u2019t drilled yet. Obviously going forward, we will be going to areas as we expand out of our current drilling areas, but generally we have assumed version 2.0 type results.","3.0 would be an upside and I think as Tim mentioned when you look at the capital spending and what our cost will be that our cost right now reflect what we've done to date we haven\u2019t baked in any additional efficiencies even though I would tell you that I think the teams are very focused on improving further.","John Freeman","Okay, that helps. Thanks again guys. Well done.","Operator","Okay, we got a next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Hi good morning everybody. Scott, I know we are going to see each other later in the year, but congratulations. We're looking forward to seeing what happens next with the Company post your retirement. I think my question really is a follow-up to John's on the medium-term guidance. Is it kind of an activity level, meaning like a rig trajectory, that you are using to cap your assumptions? I'm really trying to understand what the constraints are. $55 oil is obviously fairly modest I think by most people's long-term expectations. So, what happens if oil prices are substantially higher than that? Let's assume $65, $70. What would Pioneer look like there??","Scott Sheffield","Yes, Dough I mean I think what is amazing to me that we can achieve 15% production growth up to 2020 in average $52 to $53 oil price environment. And obviously in a $60, $70, $80 price environment the company will have to bring forward more of their locations, and the growth rate is going to be that much higher.","What you got to factor in though is what is going to happen in the service cost and we saw what happened in 2014. So, that's why I said that personally looking at the models with rather oil stay in the $50 to $55 range and keep cost in check, but as a large shareholder and so - but obviously as a curtailment the group have the lot of access cash flow then they will bring forward more and more of those 20,000 locations.","Doug Leggate","Maybe as kind of an infill question to try and frame out what I'm really trying to get at is obviously there's been a lot of chatter over the last three or four years about what the infrastructure implications are in addition to the drilling capital and so on. And obviously that became a focus issue a year or two ago. So that's kind of what I'm getting at. What are the constraints over the activity level? How would you choose to move forward? Would growth be the top priority, or in a $10 higher oil price environment, would you choose to do something different?","Timothy Dove","So, Dough the way I would cash it would be in a $10 higher oil price environment, number one our cash flow is dramatically higher, which would enable us to spend more and still be within cash flow in that period of let's say 2018 to 2020. So I would say we want to put the rigs to work to do that to utilize that capital to the extent the returns are as good as they are today even at a lower prices. Right now, we have baked in adding three to five rigs per year in 2017, 2018, 2019 probably in that range and when we do that we have some dramatic growth increases that we have already shown you.","I think if you look then at what would you do to the extent you are higher than that we can actually put more rigs to work out with three or four year that\u2019s clear. There is a point at which we had 45 vertical rigs running in the Permian basin at one time. So I think we can actually physically get this, I think it's just a matter of deciding how much to this PV that we want to bring forward. We certainly do have the cash wherewithal to do it. And I think it's just a matter of getting boots on the ground.","We would have to spend more on infrastructure that\u2019s clear. Right now we have baked into internal modeling $250 million, $300 million a year, of other PPNA for just that. We would eventually bump into the need for expansion of our sand plant, at that rate and that would probably be a 2018, 2019 scenario. We would probably also be in a position where we would want to add another gas plant out there in 2018 or so if that were to occur. Just to deal with the additional volumes, which come from a more accelerated campaign.","And the water system of course is pretty clear that we are building out a substantial water system for higher a rig count than is there today, we might need to accelerate some of that spending. Of course that\u2019s we feel like going to pay-off really well in the long-term. So there is more of the above we would need in terms of infrastructure, of course in a higher cash flow model we need to be prepared to fun all that.","Doug Leggate","Alright, I have taken up enough time. I'll let someone else jump on. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Pierce Hammond with Simmon.","Pierce Hammond","Good morning guys, and congrats on a great quarter.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks Pierce.","Timothy Dove","Thanks Pierce.","Pierce Hammond","So, my first question is do you think, being vertically integrated provides you a competitive advantage in the beginning of a cycle when all producers are seeking to increase activity? And to pick up a little bit on Scott's comments for sort of a preference for $55 where you guys can grab share at other producers\u2019 expense, I mean do you think you have better service cost price insulation than other producers because of your vertical integration?","Timothy Dove","I think that\u2019s definitely the case Pierce. If you look at the immediate advantage we have is when things improved, today we only have five or even fleets working essentially full-time. When things improve and\/or maybe you get back to Doug\u2019s case where you have $10 higher oil before adding rigs, we have got two fleets already to go, at a point where seven fleets could handle a higher rig count.","The issue the industry is going to face in terms of getting warm bodies out into the field is substantial. We are by virtue of this vertical integration in public services 100% insulated from that. So we can go to work immediately when we are ready to accelerate and not have to stumble around and find people to go operate our facilities and our equipment.","I would say the same thing about our sand business. We have ready sand available especially until we expand to meet a substantial amount of our needs. So we don\u2019t have to be dependent upon when things get crazy on sand of having to haul in a bunch of white sand from Wisconsin. It will be in that scenario twice as expensive as local Brady sand.","So I think as we emerge from the downturn, I think we are actually better prepared, because of vertical integration and not. That said, we are not making any money at vertical integration now that\u2019s clear. That\u2019s true to all our service companies. But we will also be protecting ourselves in terms of rate increase going forward by doing almost or a substantial amount of that work ourselves.","Pierce Hammond","Thank you for that Tim. Then my follow up if I thought Slide 18 in your presentation deck was very illuminating as it illustrates the very low production costs for your Permian horizontals. Just curious why your Eagle Ford production costs are so much higher.","Scott Sheffield","Its mainly the biggest component I mentioned is the gathering and transportation down there. So that\u2019s basically as you know around $6 a barrel for condensate and mid $0.60 for gas.","Pierce Hammond","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Hi, good morning guys and congratulations to both Tim and Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks Calio.","Evan Calio","The two new elements that I see in the presentation really are the cash margins per play where horizontal Midland is a standout, and the reintroduction of this 2020 growth within cash flow at low leverage. Is the message here really to emphasize your differentiated growth profile is achievable without issuing additional equity, at least on the strip? And in disclosing the horizontal Midland cash margins, do you see that as an indication of material corporate return improvements as those Midland 2.0, 3.0 become an increasing mix on production?","Scott Sheffield","Yes I mean that\u2019s defiantly the case and that\u2019s the main point we\u2019re trying to make that\u2019s we can live within cash flow, keep a great balance sheet, company issue equity don\u2019t need to sell assets.","Evan Calio","And maybe a follow-up there, how do assets fit into this longer term outlook? Future sales for the Eagle Ford or less core Midland would appear to bolster both those elements, both returns from the cash margins that you disclosed as well as - I mean, clearly, it would reduce any funding needs.","Scott Sheffield","As I have already said, the last the several years, on the company with all assets are up for sale at the right price and if somebody offers us a great price at the right time, the company will always look at it and redeploying that capital into the best performing assets.","Evan Calio","That makes sense. One last if I could. On the growth guidance, I know you have one times leverage. Is that commodity dependent, or is that something you would target longer-term regardless of where oil prices ultimately trade?","Scott Sheffield","As we said before Evan, it\u2019s going to be - we are going to drill based on returns and so it will depend where commodity prices are, we are going to always give returns, but based on where the strip is, we\u2019re very comfortable with the program that we in place.","Evan Calio","So that could increase is I guess what I'm trying to understand.","Scott Sheffield","Well I think as Tim said, yes, we saw $10 increase in commodity prices and yes we could increase to use that cash flow for high return projects.","Evan Calio","Great. That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Wolf Research.","Paul Sankey","Hi guys. Thanks. A long-term one and a short-term one if I could. Scott, I will go to your first for the long-term. In the past, you have talked about I think as much as a $100 billion need to develop your own acreage. I think the time frame was 2025. You have gone through quite a lot of detail on the outlook to 2020. Given what you were saying about the length of your career, could you just think forward for us into the very long-term about how the Permian has developed and where it sits and how much Pioneer is going to have to spend in order to do that? Thank you.","Timothy Dove","Yes, I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going on the website, next week in next slide deck, but I\u2019m speaking to 3000 engineers and geologists in San Antonio taking about the premium and so there is a interesting slide deck that will come out next week in their presentation. But I'm not firm belief as the Permian is going to be the only driver of long-term oil growth in this country. And it\u2019s going to grow on, that\u2019s about 5 million barrels a day from 2 million.","Even in this current strip, $55 price environment. So it\u2019s got the best rock, obviously the best margins and it will provide essentially the only growth long-term. I mean the stack play and the scoot play, may be Niobrara do a little bit, but the Bakken and Eagle Ford I think there is no way they can recover to the level that have already had. so that's why I'm confident that world needs the Permian, the Permian is going to be the future of the U.S. and help in world supply.","Paul Sankey","That number that you have made, I may have misquoted you and I apologize, but did you had sort of $100 billion kind of number that you talked about for Pioneer alone?","Timothy Dove","We still show it down, just taken the well cost $7 million times 20,000 locations that\u2019s the $140 billion. It\u2019s an easy number to get to.","Frank Hopkins","This is Frank. The good news is it's actually coming down from where it was before.","Paul Sankey","Well that was somewhat why I was asking Scott, because obviously this is a shifting dynamic. And yes. I look forward to looking at the presentation. The short-term question is just how rig rates and how your contractual structure is changing. Is there anything to add on whether those costs are coming down as you roll off contracts and how are you reshaping contracts, anything you could add on that? Thank you.","Scott Sheffield","I think Paul the current rates that we understand are being marketed up on roughly a $14,000 today in terms of rig rate. Our contracts typically if you look at the things we signed over two to three years ago that were intended to deal with the higher price than we're dealing with today. In terms of commodities were struck at roughly 25 to 26, so I think there is a dramatic improvement in the waiting for us. I think the fact is, a lot of those rigs don\u2019t come off till as we get into the later part of this year and particularly into next year. So next year is when we are going to start seeing peeling off of existing contracts and then starting to revamp the platform of the rig campaigns at the spot prices.","Paul Sankey","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott Sheffield","Good morning.","Brian Singer","And Scott, congratulations on the retirement. And Tim, congratulations as well.","Timothy Dove","Thanks Brian.","Brian Singer","Given the higher water needs as you move more towards Version 3.0 completions, can you give us a little bit more detail as you mentioned water infrastructure a bit earlier from a higher oil price acceleration perspective, but can you give us an update on water infrastructure plans, how capital could evolve there in 2017 and 2018, particularly if you do move to 3.0 completion? And would that open the door at all to changing the managing of chokes to opening the choke down the road?","Timothy Dove","Well you have got two to three questions built in there. I would say that we have a big multiplicative effect going on right now, because in combination with one in the front more volume of water per foot, were also increasing average lateral lengths. So the amount of water we're pumping has gone up dramatically, it's easy to calculate some of these wells that would have gone up roughly a third compared to where it was done in the past, and we're already pumping quite a bit of water.","So, I think the answer is water is going to be a key, I think we had identified even a couple of years ago if you recall, when we talked about building out at that time what was a massive water system. In response to the downturn, we have curtailed some of that spending and postponed it, but there may be a day racking for that as we move forward especially in the scenarios of higher prices.","But sufficed to say we are taking water from these city of Odessa, this is effluent water as we speak, and we still plan on an agreement with the city of Midland to do the same, then contract with the city of Midland has us investing capital in their water infrastructure. We are spending many this year on some of our main line systems, but what we would want to do further work on our main lines and some of our secondary storage systems basically frac ponds as we move forward.","I think we can do it in a relatively piece meal basis, but as I said, as we're pumping higher volumes it becomes more problematic, in terms of volume needs. One thing we are doing is trying to get of course to where we are not using any fresh water. We are making big strides right now in expanding our recycling programs. So to where we can get there I think in a matter of couple of years to where we are not using any freshwater.","We are doing a lot in terms of drilling new saltwater disposal wells on one hand, but also this is brackish water sources. On the saltwater disposal front, you can kind of the other side of the coin, which is to say this water is when you start turning the wells on for production. Coming back to you, we are pushing more water down in the system of another completion of how that water comes back and you got a have a place to put it.","Rather than overbuilding the facilities at least, this is tank batteries for saltwater production, which had been generally speaking designed for lower volume. Now we have dramatically higher volumes of water just produced water coming back at us. Rather than overbuilding the infrastructure and in doing so basically creating a situation where you never would be able to use a peak capacity, we would rather choke these wells back.","In some cases, they have been choked back for roughly only a couple of weeks. Now we are seeing you know in some cases you saw in the data that I showed you 45 days or 60 days and when the water starts coming off a system, then you would get to a point finally where the facilities can handle it. So I think we would rather [indiscernible] on the side of not overbuilding facilities and just gradually put these wells on production than the other side of the coin.","Brian Singer","That's really helpful. And if there is a day of reckoning just based on the increased water needs down the road in Version 3.0, is there still room on the balance sheet from the equity offering of a couple years ago for that expansion, or would that be something that would be kind of incremental as a major infrastructure project?","Timothy Dove","I don\u2019t think the only that we would look at to wow this is going to blow the doors of the balance sheet from the standpoint, cost requirements from infrastructure. We use an example our Midland contract probably will roughly require $100 million of investment and we are spending $50 million to $100 million probably every year any way on the water systems. So that\u2019s not that substantial.","You look at gas processing facilities typically in our case they run $140 million or so, we have 27% interest so that\u2019s not very material. So I think you will see us still go about it in somewhat of a piecemeal fashion considering we are not at the point where we were in 2014. 2014 we were forecasting going from 25 rigs to 100 rigs over eight year period. I would say, today we are at 12 going to 17 and hoping to go to 30 over the next three year or so.","So we are really not in the same scenario we were in, but nevertheless we are pumping more volumes and so there is that affect. But it will be something we have to continually spend money on, but I think we will still do it more piecemeal, you are not going to see us coming out with a huge multi $100 million water project any given year.","Scott Sheffield","And Brian that\u2019s built in our five-year plan too, so if we factored that in and we are talking about this the five year growth profile.","Brian Singer","That's helpful. Last quick one, how close are you to actually taking the EURs up based on Version 2.0, or are you still waiting and watching?","Frank Hopkins","Well hey Brian I'll answer that, this is Frank. I got this question last night from one of your analyst brother and I think when you say taking the type curve or the EUR up, I think we pretty much signaled that when you look at the performance on our wells the 25% to 35% type improvements. I mean we are basing our forward program on that. So however, you want to couch it in terms of taking the type curve up, I think we signaled pretty loud and clear that we comfortable with the performance we have been seeing and we expect to see in the future.","Timothy Dove","I would add by just simply saying we are now saying that 2.0 is the standard.","Frank Hopkins","Right.","Brian Singer","Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Mead with Johnson Rice.","Charles Mead","Good morning Scott, Tim, and to the rest of your team there. If I could, I would like to go back and ask one more question on that compelling data point or stake you guys put in the ground about 2018 and being able to grow - keep the growth rate at 15% while spending within cash flow at 55%. What I'm curious about is, if you had done a similar analysis, or a similar scenario, back at the beginning of this year, say six, seven months ago, what would that - what would the oil price have needed to be then to get that same 15% growth rate? And do you have a sense of whether the biggest gains are behind us, or are perhaps still in front of us?","Timothy Dove","Well I think Charles, sufficed to say we were looking at 60 to 65 case to be able to achieve the same type of scenario, we\u2019re looking at here, if you look at a year ago or so. And all we\u2019re really saying is our model now has changed dramatically. So in this sense regardless of the commodity prices, our cost levels have come down, our productivity has come up to the point where, the old 60, 65 is basically now at 50 to 55, that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying. And this is from data, this isn\u2019t just from smoke okay. This is from the well result we see and the cost we had been able to achieve and so that\u2019s how its answers the question.","Charles Mead","And any thought on the size of what's left in front of you, or that's just the unknown and we will find out when we get there?","Timothy Dove","I don\u2019t know I mean, I'll leave that answer, I guess the question is going forward. We can actually grow it almost any rate we wanted, we have spend so much capital we want to put to work.","Charles Mead","Got it. Thank you Tim. And then my follow-up I guess dovetails big with Brian's question earlier. As you have changed this completion style, as you have gone to not just longer laterals but more water per foot, that sort of thing, have you had to - I think you have already answered this, that you have decided you are not going to change your surface facilities in response to that. But I'm wondering. Is there - is that the correct read and is there a trade-off implicit there between, if you are going to keep your surface facilities the same way, that you are going to have to wait longer to learn what you would've learned earlier with\u2026","Timothy Dove","Yes I think on trade, I think I mentioned that Charles, there is trade off , it has to do with not over building, when you only - we see this all the time in guess prices to give you an example, where you build a gas plant. And if you are not careful, you would build it for the capacity that exist one day and you see production declines and you only to use the capacity you built out and the extra cost for the minimal amount of times.","So there is this tradeoff between over capitalizing a project and\/or the need for current production. I think we are in the range of 30 to 40 or 45 days in terms of choking the wells back. That\u2019s really in material, I mean it does postpone our knowledge base for whatever that is 30 days, but we really six months or so anyway of production day to figure out and how these wells are going to do. We are not there to worried about the postponement of thirty days of knowledge that\u2019s doable, and that\u2019s reasonable cost to the trade.","Charles Mead","Thanks Tim. That's good detail.","Timothy Dove","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe if I could ask, maybe starting off with a question on long-term kind of, again, another longer-term development type question. As you eventually turn to a more holistic development plan across multiple horizons, I guess the idea of developing effectively a large three-dimensional cube is a as appose to just one, one or two horizons at a time. Any thoughts on what you may be able to capture in terms of capital efficiency longer-term via the more efficient use of surface infrastructure and so on?","Timothy Dove","Yes, the catch there would be first of all as you know we have it as a sort of a goal to drill a series of Wolfcamp B wells and then come back on delayed A's in the Wolfcamp. So that's just dramatic approach we are taking, that means we also need to come back later on for example lower strip ratio's zones and so on, but in terms of - as you look at the capital requirements of all that, what we do know is we need to build tank barriers here for 60 wells essentially.","So the cost efficiency comes especially on the last, let\u2019s just say half of those wells. The first set of wells would be subject to several million dollars worth of the capital just to put the facilities out there, the last wells are subject to 150,000of capital, because the fact the facility is already there and we have to just put in some production equipment. So you actually do see improving returns, if you look at simple, identical well metrics the further you go into the program. We are building for the future. What we are saying is as we don\u2019t want to overbuild for the future.","Ryan Todd","Alright, thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe on lateral length, do you have a view at this point of what the sweet spot is in terms of lateral length? You have gone as long as 12,000 feet. Is it the longer, the better? Is there a trade-off at some point that you have seen between lateral length and completion risk? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what percentage of your overall northern portfolio is conducive to I guess 9,000 to 10,000 foot laterals?","Timothy Dove","The answer to that question the last question is about 60% would be amenable to 9,500 to 10,000 foot laterals today. We're building that inventory up as I mentioned vis-\u00e0-vis trades and another methods to make sure we could increase the lateral lengths, but as you look forward and you look at what lateral lengths seem to be optimal. Our average in the Wolfcamp B I think this year is now being edging up to about 9,500. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that number go up from here just on the basis of what I just mentioned.","However, there is probably a limit which we would call it today horizontal link, probably in the neighborhood of 13,000 feet maybe a little bit more than that just based on for the massive hydraulics. It's you have a lot of line losses that you pump volumes down that long as a horizontal pipe and so the risk you have is not getting of proper fracs especially at the toe of the wells.","And so I think we kind of are in a position of having tested this out that we believe we start to get diminishing returns potentially at let's say 13,000, we probably avoid any kind of diminishing turns all the way up to let's say 11 to 12. So when we start seeing diminishing returns, I think it's where we sort of call it a day, I think that's why we're going to call that. It's not a technical limit it is more of a economic limit.","Ryan Todd","Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning guys. Thanks for getting me in. Scott, for you, or Tim, just wondering, when you look at Version 3.0 or 2.0, I guess I'm just looking at sort of Slides 9 and 10, and not only obviously are they well above that type curve that you had set out. But I guess what I'm getting at is kind of comparing that Version 3.0 and 2.0, it looks like initially they're relatively the same, and then you start to see some pretty nice expansion in 3.0 over 2.0 later on. Is that more just because the demand choke program you have initially and basically throughout you start to see a pretty good difference between the two versions?","Timothy Dove","Yes let me just say the straight part of those curves is the period during which the wells are choked, which means we are limiting on a daily basis. When you open the choke, you start to see thing bump up and go above the line. So that\u2019s precisely what you are looking at.","Neal Dingmann","Got it. And then just lastly very quick, just on the production guidance that's given out there, with five rigs coming on and obviously this enhanced completion, how - and I don't think you have given the exit rate but how do you think of - I know you have got, Scott, the 2017 sort of guidance out there. You have obviously got the 2016. Should we think of it just being a bit pretty linear or because of the five rigs coming on, you will have a bit of a bump the first half of next year?","Scott Sheffield","Yes, I think you know we are in at 13 to 17 and we may see a quarter or two bump up, but it\u2019s going to be fairly close to that very consistency.","Timothy Dove","It\u2019s just going to be waves kind of depending upon when you put rigs on. The wave comes six months after you put a rig on just because of the completion time, our drilling and completion time. So I think you will see a wave , this will get you get in the part of 2017 a positive wave. And it just depends on we add any further rigs in 2017 where you get other waves in the rest of next year.","Neal Dingmann","Analyst : Makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeb Bachmann with Scotia Howard Weil.","Jeb Bachmann","Good morning guys. Just a couple of quick ones. First on I guess the Eagle Ford, any communications from Reliance on resuming activity with the uptick in the commodity and the improvement in your differentials down there?","Timothy Dove","So Jeb we are in the middle of discussion on that, so we are sort of precluded from giving you much detail as we are evaluating 2017 capital budget. But sufficed to say Eagle Ford is sensitive to needless to say oil prices, because we produce condensate there, so that has an effect, but also NGLs particularly ethane. Of course that's improved some as well, natural gas prices are important peers as well. We will be watching all of those with our partner and evaluating how many rigs to run if any for next year. of course, I think we would prefer to run some rigs and I think our partner would too, but that\u2019s just simply matter for JV to come to conclusion on.","Jeb Bachmann","Okay, great. Tim, any update on storage for the Permian volumes down in Midland and maybe in Corpus Christi?","Richard Dealy","Its Rich. Well in Mainland the tank is up and running and so we have got 600,000 barrels of storage capacity down there and we\u2019re using it today and mostly selling in domestic market today, and then in Corpus Christi that one is still not suppose to be until later this year?","Jeb Bachmann","Any idea on the size of that one?","Richard Dealy","Its Oxy\u2019s facilities so I don\u2019t know the exact size of the top of my head, but its big.","Jeb Bachmann","Great. I appreciate it guys.","Operator","And that concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Sheffield, at this time I will turn the conference back to u for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Sheffield","Again thanks. I will be seeing most of you over the next two weeks as we get out these last energy conferences over the next few months. Looking forward to the last call for myself. I'm turning it over to Tim here in what is it November?","Timothy Dove","The calls in November.","Richard Dealy","Dates December 31st.","Scott Sheffield","Yes, yes.

Please go ahead, sir.","Neal Shah","Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be up first. He will discuss our strong second quarter results underpinned by solid execution and our reduced capital guidance for the full year. After Scott concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance optimized for rate of return. Rich will then update you on the benefits of our downstream planning for both oil and gas. Scott will then return with a brief recap and commentary. After that, we will open up the call for your questions.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Neal. Good morning. On Slide 3, on creating value. The first key point is we continued to buy back stock. And obviously, where the stock is today, we'll be continuing to aggressively buy back stock third quarter on averaging our price down. What's great is that we had the best balance sheet of the independents in the business to allow us to do this.","We lowered the top end of guidance of our capital by $150 million with capital efficiency. We increased our dividend up to $1.76 per share with a yield of about 1.5%, and we moved to a quarterly distribution. We achieved our G&A savings much quicker than expected. Third quarter, we'll be down to about $2.25 of BOE. On a cash basis, we'll be below $2, moving toward a target established for the company toward $2 in 2020 and below $1.70 on a cash basis -- on a BOE basis. ","We did achieve free cash flow when you add back in our restructuring charge for the second quarter based on the strip of about a week ago. We're establishing significant free cash flow second half of 2019 based on D, C & F on Footnote 2, continuing to show great cash flow uplift for our vision about exporting crude oil several years ago to the Gulf Coast and exporting around the world. $81 million, second quarter; $230 million, the first half. ","Going to Slide 4. Again, we're at the top end of guidance on production and with significant improved capital efficiency. Next slide, Slide 5. Again, I mentioned that we're reducing our capital guidance at the top end by $150 million. Our drilling and completion teams are performing at very high levels around the clock. We've accelerated our West Texas annualization and reducing our infrastructure cost spending by about $50 million, lowering the top end of guidance approximately 4.5%.","Slide 6. Outlook is still great. Our $3.5 billion would have been increased over $3.6 billion without the restructuring charges. Again, I'll mention -- congratulate our D&C teams for executing at a very high level of efficiency throughout the company.","Slide 7, on improving our cost structure. I've already given the highlights, moving our targets down significantly. We're already in the top quartile of our peers. The goal is to stay there. As I said, the goal -- long-term goal is get below $2 per BOE, on a cash basis to be below $1.70 and continuing to drive it down over time.","Slide 8. Our priority is aligned now with our shareholders, returning $825 million already to shareholders, including when you pro forma the dividend yield of 1.5% and buying back over 2% of our stock already with future buybacks to occur in the third and fourth quarter, increasing the dividend already, as I mentioned, to 1.5% yield and going to a quarterly distribution. It's up 2,100% already from first quarter in '17. When you look at buying back our shares pro forma dividend and growing mid-teens, we're giving 20% back to the shareholders.","On Slide 9, 10, 11 and 12, I'm going to go ahead and give some comments on the big-picture items and hit a few highlights on those four slides, on 9, 10, 11, 12. After returning and studying recent reports put out by Rystad, WoodMac, IHS, S&P Global and some sell-side reports, I'm convinced Pioneer has the most productive wells and the highest returns in the Permian Basin with the most contiguous acreage position that's been drilling the widest-spacing wells more than anybody else over the last six years. We do not have to downspace due to our contiguous nature of our position in the Midland Basin.","From these reports, the Delaware is being drilled aggressively by many more operators. Rig count and Tier 1 acreage is being exhausted at a very quick rate. Similar reports have Delaware peaking in 2024 because of the aggressive drilling and downspacing because companies are essentially running out of inventory. The same reports are showing that the Midland Basin will not peak until the mid-2030s.","I am lowering my expectations of the Permian, reaching 1 million barrels of oil per day growth annually as it did in 2018. I'm still convinced the Permian will reach 8 million barrels a day at a much slower pace with the Midland Basin as the only growing basin in the U.S. past 2025.","Going back to Slide 9, 10, 11, 12 just to make a few key points, and we'll turn it over to our next speaker. On Slide 9 obviously are just points to make. As I mentioned already, I think they're mostly obvious on why the Midland Basin is the best place to be with our acreage position in regard to well cost, oil quality, OpEx and commodity mix.","Going to Slide 10. This is a slide from the sell side showing that we have the best returns in the business, and I'm convinced by reading these other reports that we do have that. Also, to help with those returns, Rich will talk more about the fact that we've aggressively hedged with the ramp in price several weeks ago, up -- with Brent up into the mid-60s. We're aggressively hedged in 2019 with swaps and also -- for the second half and also in 2020, which will help our return on capital employed growth. Over the next several years, the goal is to get our ROCE up to the mid-teens over the next 3 to 5 years in a $60 Brent market or $53, $54 WTI market. ","Slide 11, the key there is the fact that we already have taken positions of exporting most all of our crude. We're getting the highest prices. And the fact that WTI in Midland, 41 degree gravity is getting a premium price to Delaware crude. ","And Slide 12, again, we have an unmatched footprint, probably the highest net revenue interest among all the independents, low royalty. And it's interesting, the fact that we saw a couple of things happen. One with us, we sold some noncore assets this quarter for $20,000 per acre. It's the first time we've seen a cash deal coming in from private equity over the last two years. We'll continue to do that as we see great opportunity to deliver on noncore asset sales. In addition, we saw noncore assets go for $31,500 per acre with a deal that Oxy announced recently.","I'll now turn it over to Joey for Slide 13.","Jerome Hall","Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to be picking up on Slide 13. And I know there's been a lot of discussion recently about well spacing and the resulting parent-child effects. And as Scott just noted, Pioneer is in the enviable position of having approximately 680,000 mostly contiguous acres. And it's our acreage position that allows us to prioritize returns and capital efficiency rather than artificially increasing our inventory through tight well spacing, which, as we know, increases your exposure to the parent-child impacts. It's this development strategy, combined with advances in our completions methodology over time, is what has allowed us to improve well productivity year-over-year, as you can see there on the right-hand side. ","Now I'm going to be moving on to Slide 14. Here, we're illustrating an additional factor in our ability to sustainably deliver strong margins. Looking on the left-hand side, you can see that based on gross production and normalizing on a two stream basis, Pioneer has consistently delivered the highest oil percentage in the basin since 2016. And then on the right-hand side, you can see that Pioneer also has the best 12-month cumulative oil production in the basin. These two facts, combined with our development strategy discussed in the previous slide, should lead to the best margins and the highest returns in the basin over time.","Now moving on to Slide 15, my last slide. Here, we're highlighting another successful Wolfcamp D appraisal. This was the Wolfcamp D 2-well pad in Western Glasscock County. And after 180 days, it is outperforming previous wells in the same area by 82%. We did POP 83 wells in Q2, and it's important to note that we deferred some facilities projects until the back half of the year. Once again, as Scott noted, a solid quarter of execution for the Permian team. Congrats to all. ","And now I'm going to turn it over to Rich.","Richard Dealy","Thanks, Joey, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 16 where you can see that we had realized oil prices of $60 a barrel for the quarter that did include a significant uplift related to the firm transportation Scott talked about, moving our oil to the Gulf Coast where we get Brent-related pricing. This increased our price by over $4 for oil for the quarter and, as Scott mentioned, provided about $81 million of incremental cash flow or $230 million year-to-date through June. Based on our forecasted prices for the third quarter, we are expecting an uplift of about $25 million to $75 million in the third quarter from the ability to move our oil and export it on the Gulf Coast.","During the second quarter, we moved about 90% of our oil, roughly 200 -- over 200,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast, of which 80% of it was exported with roughly 60% of that going to Asia and 40% to Europe. Longer term, our firm transportation commitments increase to about 250,000 barrels late into 2020, which is consistent with our forecasted production growth.","As I discussed in prior quarters, we try to move all of our products to higher-priced markets. And during the second quarter, we moved about 60% of our gas out west and priced it up the SoCal index. During the second quarter, this provided about $20 million to $25 million of incremental cash flow and improved our gas price realizations relative to other Permian players.","Once Gulf Coast Express comes on in the fourth quarter, we will move about 300 million cubic feet a day to the Gulf Coast and price that on a Ship Channel price index. And at that point, virtually all of our gas will be sold outside of the Permian Basin.","As Scott mentioned, before the pullback in commodity prices, we did aggressively hedge for 2019, 2020. So now we have for the remainder of 2019 72,000 barrels a day of oil hedged at Brent prices around $67 and 67,000 barrels a day of 2020 production hedged at roughly $64 per barrel, each of those with upside. ","Turning to Slide 17. I think this slide highlights two key financial benefits that Pioneer has. First, it highlights the fact that we have the strongest balance sheet amongst our peers. And you can see that by -- measured against debt versus EBITDA basis. And then secondly, it highlights the quality of our wells and our cost structure as we have the highest EBITDA per BOE of our peers. This does not reflect the recent restructuring that we went through and the annualized $100 million savings. And so that will just further improve our margins. Both these point to our industry-leading financial position and our efforts to continue to improve margins and corporate returns.","So why don't I stop there, and I'll turn it back to Scott for a few closing comments.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Rich. On Slide 18, I think all these key points speak for themselves. But my primary goal is to get the company to free cash flow as quickly as possible as I came back. And I'm surprised how efficient, and all 2,000 employees are working around the clock and got us there already second quarter when I made the comment about getting free cash flow when you add back the restructuring charges for second quarter. So that's what I'm most proud of. We're going to continue to deliver free cash flow, and it's going to be a balance between growth, returning -- increasing dividends. As I mentioned earlier in the past, the goal is to get up to the average of the S&P 500 as quickly as possible and then also continuing our share buyback program. So again, I think all these key points speak for themselves, so I won't go over detail. Again, thanks. We'll turn it up over now to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll now take our first question from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram","This first question perhaps for Joey. I was wondering, Joey, if you could maybe discuss the optimal project or well packet size that you think is there to optimize returns and free cash flow generations from your asset base.","Jerome Hall","So from an execution perspective, the three well pad is what has been our bread and butter through and through. But as time is going on now, we're increasing that to four and six wells, and we're getting extremely good at that. But it's kind of hard to explain it as a package because sometimes we drill these larger projects with one rig and sometimes, we drill with same two rigs. But I would say going forward, it's not going to be uncommon for us to see 4, 6, 8 and 10 well pads. And probably, the sweet spot, somewhere in the six well pad size.","Arun Jayaram","Great. And just to my follow-up, Scott, in the press release, you guys highlighted how you believe that executing on the mid-teens oil growth outlook is the best or optimal in terms of generating top-tier returns and optimizing your free cash flow generation. My question is thinking about the next couple of years, you started the year running 24 rigs. You're down to 19. I think your guidance called for a rig count between 21 and 23 this year, and we thought you needed to add two or three rigs kind of per annum to support that growth. So just wondering how you're thinking about the next couple of years, particularly with Brent prices now moving towards in the mid-50s.","Scott Sheffield","Yes. First of all, I just don't think the world's going to -- it could, but I don't think the world's going to be $55 for the next three years. That puts WTI down to about $48, $49 net prices to people or $45. You're going to see a significant fallback in Permian growth. You'll probably move toward no growth for most people. But on that basis, we've got a great balance sheet. We have cash in the balance sheet, and we can drill through the cycle if we choose. So we're sticking with our mid-teens growth long term, adding two to three rigs per year. So I have -- we haven't changed our opinion at this point in time even if we go to the mid-50s.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas Leggate","Scott, yourself and your offspring are the two only stocks green in the screen this morning, so congrats on the progress you've made since you got back.","I've got two questions, if I may. First, on the commentary in the press release about acreage sales on longer-dated stuff that you might not get to in this slower rate of growth, I guess, versus what we had previously thought of Pioneer. How is that process evolving? Do you expect meaningful asset sales period? And if you can maybe just give us a broader update on how things are going with Targa and maybe your considerations around water infrastructure.","Scott Sheffield","Yes. In regard to all three, both infrastructure items you mentioned, natural gas, midstream and water and also on drillco, we will update when we complete those three items. So I expect two of them will be done by the end of the year. And then water, as we mentioned in the past, we're evaluating it now and we'll make it -- the Board will make a decision in 2020. So all three are being evaluated, proceeding as expected.","In regard to acreage sales, we will continue -- as I mentioned in the past -- over the last two years, there hasn't been much done, except for the Oxy transaction, which people have established acreage costs somewhere between $40,000 and $55,000 per acre for that transaction by various sell-side and external reports. We've seen this recent transaction for Ecopetrol doing a deal with Oxy at $31,500 per acre. In our treasure maps in the Midland Basin is where the experts, only 15% of that acreage was in core, 85% was noncore. So it seems like a very, very high price for noncore acreage. We would sell noncore acreage all day long at $31,500 per acre. Hopefully, we'll get continued asset noncore acreage for $20,000 per acre. So we are excited about that transaction.","And so far, the drillco process, as I mentioned earlier, if we decide to pursue with that by the end of the year, it's established around the same prices I've already mentioned, somewhere in that $20,000 to $30,000 per acre is what we would be selling that piece of the acreage for when you look at their expected returns. So hope that helps, Doug.","Douglas Leggate","Yes, it does. My follow-up is maybe for Rich. And it is kind of a philosophical question, I guess, because tripling or stepping up the dividend the way that you've done really starts to address an issue, I guess, that oil industry has been challenged with, which is how to value your sector that you in particular and obviously the general E&P space almost to the point of thinking along the lines of a dividend discount model with the depths of the acreage that you have in inventory and so on. So my question really is in order to help the generals do something like that, you need to have an idea what your thoughts are on future dividends strategy, payout ratios, trajectory for how that growth might follow your underlying capacity for cash flow growth. So I'm just wondering if you could share with us, now that you've reset the dividend to remain competitive as to how the growth rate with -- how do you think about that?","Richard Dealy","As we've demonstrated and Scott talked about, increasing from $0.08 on an annualized basis over the last couple of years to $1.76, it's clearly a focus of the company. And as we move to a free cash flow generative model, as we think about it longer term, I think we want to get to a dividend level that's competitive with the S&P 500. We'd like to do that as soon as possible, but we've got to be prudent about it where commodity prices are at. And as I said before, I mean returning capital to shareholders is an important part of our value proposition and is something that we'll continue to do over time.","Douglas Leggate","But is there like a payout target that you would consider like keeping it less than 10% of cash flow or something of that ilk?","Richard Dealy","I think, Doug, over time, we want to evaluate that. Clearly, we want to be free cash flow positive, and a chunk of that will be designated to go back into returning money to shareholders.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. We'll see how it evolves. Sorry, Scott, go ahead.","Richard Dealy","The exact percentage today, I just can't tell you what the exact percentage will be, but it will be -- a fair amount of that free cash flow will be returned to shareholders.","Operator","I'll now take a question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.","Jeanine Wai","So in terms of the rig additions potentially in the back half of the year and trying to best position Pioneer operationally for 2020, can you talk about what the primary considerations are for deciding on whether you do add those rig fleet in the year and maybe how much lead time you need for planning purposes and how quickly you can actually pick up rigs?","Neal Shah","Jeanine, it's Neal. In terms of where rig count average, we put out in the beginning of the year in terms of rig budgeted, we have that average of 21 to 23 for the full year. We started the year for 24 -- at 24 rigs. We averaged roughly around that 21, 22 during Q2. We're exiting at 18 to 19. So we're expecting we'll remain well within our guidance. Q3 will roughly be, from a rig count perspective, flat with Q2. Q4 activity will be based on our thoughts on final 2020 plans, which we're still evaluating currently. But historically, as you've seen from last year, we -- it's all encompassed, as we know, as we discussed within the budget. So there would be no increase whatsoever to CapEx as we think about Q4 rig adds or activity adds in advance of 2020. But again, we're still in the process of formulating our 2020 plans.","Jerome Hall","And Jeanine, I'll just add that as far as advance notice, we have rigs that are available to us. And we just need 30 to 60 days advance notice to get those rigs back on again and mobilized.","Jeanine Wai","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, switching gears. Your marketing strategy is a big differentiator for Pioneer and you transported 205,000 barrels a day to the Gulf Coast during Q2. And I believe that amount of firm transport ramps as you ramp your own production over 250,000 barrels a day over the next couple of years. And there's been some debate in the industry on the status of just kind of new dock, new tank build-out in Corpus Christi, the status of port dredging and all those other stuff. Do you think you can generally comment on your thoughts on this industry-wide? And then if you can provide any details on Pioneer's incremental dock and tank capacity that supports going from the 205,000 to 250,000 and whether there are any changes in your existing associate infrastructure over the next couple of years, too. So just trying to evaluate the risk\/reward of your marketing agreements.","Richard Dealy","Sure, Jeanine. I think when you look at it and look at what's happening on the Gulf Coast, particularly in Corpus, there is a tremendous amount of export capacity being added. And so we don't see that as really a restrictive thing. And we're glad to see those are being added, we're glad to see the SBM projects that are -- hopefully get approved to take oil offshore and load bigger ships offshore. So I don't really see a bottleneck from that perspective really to what the growth of the U.S. crude market will be because most of that has got to get exported.","What I would say in terms of Pioneer's contracts, when we built our profile going from when we started at 15,000 barrels a day up to the 250,000 by the end of 2020, we built in all the -- in those agreements that we would have storage capacity and dock space for all those barrels. And so even past 2020, as that 250,000 continues to grow, we have dock space and contracts to storage as well. So we've matched all those things together to make sure that we don't get stuck without being able to get on the water.","Jeanine Wai","I guess after the -- part of that is there's some debate on whether there's delays in new capacity with dock space and tanks and things. So can you just verify that everything you have is existing? Or are you relying on new projects?","Richard Dealy","No, ours is all existing. So we're not relying on any new projects to meet our trajectory of production growth and moving those barrels offshore.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman","Last quarter, you highlighted that one of the initiatives was on reducing field facilities capital spending partly due to higher utilization of existing facilities. So when I look at Slide 5 and about half of the reduction in the CapEx guidance was driven by the reduced gas processing and water infrastructure spending coming down by about $50 million, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that is -- I guess, should be like a permanent reduction as opposed to some of that spending just being pushed to some outer-years.","Richard Dealy","Yes. I would say as it relates to timing on that -- well, I'm just thinking -- I know on gas processing, it's really just timing and it's when the 2020 plant was going to get built, so it's just really timing there. It will eventually get done. It's just because of the little slower growth that they don't need to build those plants quite as fast. On the water side, really, that's really our subsystems. And so as we reduced our growth profile a little bit and changed from where we were previously in how we maximize utilization of existing facilities, we were able to just push some of that capital out. And so it's going to get deferred, so those subsystems will get built in later years. But we don't need to build them in 2019.","Neal Shah","So John, I was going to say that being said, tagging on Rich's commentary, we have talked about our water spending coming down next year as well, so it's not that you're going to see an increase in water spend for 2020 over 2019. While it is deferred, that water spend will still come down in 2020.","Richard Dealy","The Midland water treatment, the facilities are -- capital for 2020 is significantly less than what it is in 2019.","John Freeman","And I guess, sort of along those same lines is my follow-up. The facility in Midland, the wastewater treatment facility upgrade, it looks like that's a little ahead of schedule from what you all had planned last quarter where you said sort of early 2021 and now it's late 2020. Can you just remind us what the cost of that upgrade was?","Richard Dealy","The total cost of that facility is roughly around $125 million. And I would say, John, there's really no changes on timing. It's on schedule and on budget.","Operator","I'll now take a question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","You mentioned, Scott, in your comments that you have the flexibility to spend through the cycle, and the balance sheet is certainly at a very low leverage with minimal debt. Can you talk to how willing you are to use the balance sheet and where your leverage thresholds are, either to drill through a down cycle or to buy back stock above and beyond internally generated free cash flow?","Scott Sheffield","Yes. I mean obviously, we got to have various views on commodity prices, but I just think the long-term goal is to have the flexibility. And you can't have the flexibility without having a great balance sheet. So like I was asked earlier about $55 Brent, obviously, at $55 Brent the next three years, I think Arun asked the question, we probably wouldn't change our plans. But we have the flexibility. If it drops too low, then we could reduce -- we have the flexibility to reduce the rig count. We could stay with the rig count, but we've got to combine that with achieving free cash flow.","So our cost under those scenarios would come down significantly from the service companies. As oil prices drop, so that's going to have a big -- so it's hard to answer the question if you do have a severe drop in commodities for several years. Generally, what's happened is that I just don't think the OPEC countries and the rest of the world -- lower oil prices will generate generally higher demand, then things will pick up fairly quickly as we've seen through the various cycles. So it's tough to really answer that long term, Brian, but the most important thing is that we have the flexibility to do any of the above that you mentioned.","Brian Singer","I guess, what I was kind of hoping for maybe was is there any upward leverage ceiling by which you would say, you know what, it's not necessarily worth drilling through? Or is there upward leverage ceiling that you would be tolerant to buy back stock regardless of the commodity environment above and beyond what you're getting post-dividend from free cash flow?","Richard Dealy","Yes. I'll say, Brian, we wouldn't want our -- from a leverage metric outlook and a debt-to-EBITDA basis, we wouldn't want it to be above 1x. We're just thinking in this business that we need to be below that level. So I think that would be what I would say the upper limit would be.","Brian Singer","Great. And then my follow-up is with regards to the Wolfcamp D results on Slide 15. Can you just add a little bit of color on what's different about the completions or the well performance of the locations chosen that drove the performance you're seeing here?","Jerome Hall","Yes. So all three is in the Wolfcamp D that we reported on here recently are relatively far away from each other. I think in one instance, about 10 miles; in another instance, about 18 miles and actually 50 miles away from our previous pad in the south area. So what we're doing is we're testing different areas. The completion recipes are relatively the same. We've done some testing of different cluster spacing and different amount of clusters because the pressure is higher, and our ability to create those fractures, it takes more energy. But for the most part, the completions have been relatively the same.","But again, we're not really testing different methodologies. We're testing different areas. We've got four other future Wolfcamp D tests planned, and they're also -- and two of them are in similar areas to the previous three and the other ones are in new areas. So again, we're mainly testing areas and appraising areas, not necessarily the completion technique, but we are making tweaks as we go.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Just wanted to ask as you think about -- you talked about the rig plans going into next year, your sensitivities around cash flows, I guess just -- or commodity prices rather. As you think about the 21 to 23 rigs, should we still be thinking about that sort of flat split of 5 rigs in the south? Or I guess what are you seeing there recently that -- is that going to compel you to increase allocation? Or should that be kind of steady state there?","Jerome Hall","No. I think you could expect to see kind of a similar level of activity in the south as you currently see.","David Deckelbaum","Okay. And I guess just -- I know part of the capital budget tweak down was realizing some of the -- or adopting some of the in-basin sands a bit earlier than you had budgeted. I guess all else equal now, how do you think about your well cost trends going into the end of the year from where we are today? And do you still see some fat to take out going into '20, I guess, on a percentage basis?","Jerome Hall","I would say the big chunks, we realized them the first half of the year, that namely being the ProPetro transaction and also the West Texas sand. The -- and some of those relate to other changes that we've made related to the type of chemicals and moving from gels to less gel and even to slick water. So those changes for the most part have transpired.","So I would say moving forward most of what we'll see are efficiency gains. That's what we've seen both on the completions and on the drilling side. So I would say the big gainers have mostly happened in the first half, and we'll just see efficiency gains in the second half of the year.","David Deckelbaum","And if I could just ask one more. Scott, high level, you talked about how, in your view, we don't see any other basin in North America, I guess, of size growing beyond 2025 other than Midland. Just given that view, does that -- how does that square with your thought process around pursuing some drillcos or selling acreage? And wouldn't that inherently kind of increase the scarcity value for your company over time? You already have a free cash projection out there that's achievable in the mid-50s. You're already growing in dividend. I guess how are you balancing that as you think about just managing this business over the long term?","Scott Sheffield","Yes. As I've said before, David, the drillco acreage is focusing on acreage that is expiring over the next five years. And that's where the main focus of it is. And so it's lower returns. It's still worth drilling today, and we drilled a few wells on it. And outside -- I mean offsite activities have shown that there are some other operators that are drilling in the area, but it doesn't meet our current hurdle rates above 50%. And so that's the acreage that we're focused on, on drillco, so that's the main difference.","But I think you're right. Based on the scarcity, if Midland Basin is the only basin growing past 2025, it will make Pioneer's properties worth twice as much money or 3x as much money at some point in time over the next 5 to 6 years.","Operator","I'll now take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wanted to ask a question. You guys have already spoken quite a bit on your marketing arrangements. So I wanted to ask a question perhaps for Rich. If you guys see -- there's already -- there's been some emerging differentiation between grades coming out of the Permian. Do you guys see more differentiation, I'm talking -- both in how you market and the pricing that you receive going forward?","And looking way further down the road, you guys have this 41-degree crude. My understanding there is that's where we're going to be relatively short in the U.S. compared to these lighter, more condensate grades. And so long term, do you guys anticipate that actually that crude is maybe going to make it to the Gulf Coast but stay there?","Richard Dealy","No. Whether it gets -- I mean it's all going to get to the Gulf Coast, for sure, and -- but I still think a big chunk of it is going to get exported. But clearly, the Midland grade, 41 degree gravity grade is getting premium pricing. For the last four months or so, it's averaged about $1.50 relative to the lighter crude coming out of the Delaware. And with the Delaware growth exceeding out of the Midland that Scott talked about, there's going to be more of the lighter quality step-on, which should make the value of our 41 degree barrel that much higher. So I think you're going to continue to see that price move up.","On the gas side, I think it's important to have takeaway out of the basin because I think any gas in the basin and there's not demand there, so it's got to get elsewhere and most of it's got to get to the Gulf Coast around California markets and mainly into LNG markets. And so we're aggressively moving our gas via whether it's Gulf Coast Express or Whistler down to the Gulf Coast as we continue to grow and getting it locked into LNG facilities or exported to Mexico. So I think both of those are important things.","Charles Meade","Got it. And Scott, I've always enjoyed your macro comments and your willingness to offer your opinion on that. I have two quick questions for you. You mentioned Delaware peaking in 2024 and Midland maybe in the mid-30s. I was wondering what the Brent price assumption was for that. And then the second piece, as I'm watching the Permian volumes through 2019, I'm starting to -- the way it looks to me is that there's going to have to be more growth in the back half of the year than we've seen so far to reach some of these estimates for Permian growth is in 2019 as a whole. And I'm wondering if you can offer your thoughts on Permian growth in the back half of '19.","Scott Sheffield","Yes. Most think tank groups are lowering their Permian growth from last year to about 600,000 to 700,000 for this year. And they're also lowering it for 2020 and going forward for all the reasons that I've said. So -- and that's due to the fact that people are drilling aggressively. They're downspacing. Now people are going to have less cash flow if we stay in the lower oil price environment. People don't want to build debt in this environment, so there's a lot of reasons why I just don't think we're going to see the long-term growth. So the majors are the only ones that are drilling aggressively. I don't see them slowing down. They've made some comments on their calls that they're having some issues. But -- so right now, I just don't -- growth is coming down for the reasons I have mentioned, so I'll stop there.","Operator","I'll now take our next question from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.","Robert Brackett","A question on the maturities of debt coming due in sort of '20 and '21. They're relatively modest relative to your enterprise value. But how do you prioritize either paying those out or refinancing them versus using the available funds for share buybacks?","Richard Dealy","Yes. I think right now, the current plan is we really look at it on a debt-to-EBITDA basis and where our leverage sits. But currently, right now, into the 2020, we're targeting to pay that off with cash on the balance sheet and still evaluate what to do in 2021.","Robert Brackett","And then a somewhat separate question. Scott, you mentioned earlier that you'd be happy to sell noncore acreage all day long in, say, $30,000. Can you just sort of contrast what you mean by noncore? Is it really high-quality acreage that you wouldn't get to in a timely fashion? Or is it the geologically sort of less core?","Scott Sheffield","Well, the piece that we sold for $20,000 per acre was an extreme North Martin County. If you remember, we did an asset sale about three years ago, and that was on the Dawson, Martin County line. It's in that similar area. It was isolated. So those are the type pieces that are noncore. It's a question whether or not you call the stuff we're looking in drillco area. I sort of call it lower-tier core. But that's the acreage that we're focused on, on the drillco. And so we've got an extensive acreage position. But -- so that's the difference between the two. So I can't tell you exactly how much noncore we have, but we do have some pieces that if we can't trade or block it up, we're going to sell somewhere between that $20,000 and $30,000 per acre range.","Robert Brackett","Is it fair to say it's more non-Pioneer core versus nonbasin core?","Scott Sheffield","Exactly. Exactly.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sheffield at this time for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Sheffield","Again, thank you for participating. Great questions, and we'll talk to everybody over the next three months. And see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"17170":["Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  3, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank E.

Hopkins","Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly go through the agenda for today's call. Scott will be the first speaker. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2012, another solid quarter for Pioneer. We'll then update you on the company's outlook for production growth, capital spending and cash flow growth. ","After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will discuss our drilling results and plans for the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale, Spraberry vertical program, the Eagle Ford Shale and the Barnett Shale Combo. He will also update you on our recent drilling success in Alaska. Rich will then cover the first quarter financials in more detail, and he'll provide earnings guidance for the second quarter. After that, we will open up the call for your questions. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Thanks, Frank. Good morning. On Slide #3, on our highlights. As Frank said we had another great quarter. We had adjusted income of $153 million or $1.23 adjusted per share. On production, we were over our range on the production side first quarter at 147,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's a pickup of about 10,000 barrels a day for the quarter versus the previous quarter, at a 7% increase, primarily related to our production growth in Spraberry, Eagle Ford and the Barnett Shale Combo play. ","Oil represented 74% of that quarterly production increase. We're still highly encouraged by the entire play that we're seeing in the horizontal Wolfcamp play. We still feel like it will be probably the biggest oil play in the U.S. over the next several years. We're up to 4 rigs in that play. Most of our activity now is focused on the southern portion where we have university lands that's expiring over the next 18 months to 20 months. ","We just brought on 2 recent wells on artificial lift: one is on jet pump and one is on gas lift. They're making mostly water at this point in time. We are still continuing to have great success by going deeper to the strong Atoka and Mississippian intervals in the Spraberry field, one of the primary reasons that we're seeing continued great success this past quarter in the Permian basin. ","In the Eagle Ford, we added our ninth CGP, expect 2 additional CGPs online by mid-year. In Alaska, we had recent success with a couple key wells, one was onshore, the Torok, where we've drilled several wells on the island. We did a plug and perf technique onshore and got a 2,000 barrel a day IP rate. That well has been suspended, and we'll look at testing it longer next winter and most likely, drilling another appraisal well next winter up there in the Torok, essentially it will give us about 50 million barrel a day discovery. ","And secondly, what's maybe even more important is that we did a plug and perf for the first time on the Nuiqsut. Nuiqsut is our main producing formation reserve-wise. We got a 4,000 barrel a day rate there. Tim will talk more about this later on. ","We completed our acquisition of the sands business. We renamed it Premier Silica. The integration has gone tremendous. Everything is going very fine there. We added frac capacity totaling 25,000 horsepower in Spraberry during April and expect additional 45,000 by midyear for a total of 300,000 horsepower for the company. ","We added some recent oil derivative positions, primarily in 2014. We'll continue to increase the percentage in the later year, 2014, on the oil side. And then, as we have mentioned before that we were close to an agreements. We have an agreement now to sell South Africa to the national oil company, PetroSA, for $52 million before tax and expect closing later this summer. ","On Slide #4, production growth targets. We're still on track of hitting first quarter at 147,000 barrels a day. Our guidance, 148,000 to 153,000 for the year, on track to deliver our 23% to 27% production growth. We're still on track to deliver our 20% CAGR over the next 3 years. One note, we are already up to 58% liquids in the first quarter of 2012, moving up to 65% liquids in 2014. ","Slide #5, on capital spending and cash flow. Our capital budget is going to remain the same: drilling, $2.4 billion; and about $400 million on vertical integration. We are front-end loaded on the first half of the year, primarily due to the Carmeuse acquisition of $300 million, in addition to our great efficiency in the Permian basin, with our frac bank people working 24 hours a day on several of our crews, getting our frac bank down. Obviously, we have a lots of sign-ups for the first half in a lot of our wells in the horizontal Wolfcamp play. ","Operating cash flow of $2.2 billion, equity proceeds of about $500 million, inventory reduction of $100 million will be within how we plan on spending our $2.8 billion. You can use your own price deck to look at the price. Obviously, the strip is a little bit higher than our $100 price deck. Hopefully, it will come in at least that high and maybe even higher. ","Slide #6. Great operating cash flow in the company, again $2.2 billion. That's based on $100 oil and $3 gas for 2012, coming on up to $2.8 billion next year for 2013 and over the next 3 years, at 25% CAGR, compounded growth rate. 80% revenue moving up to 90% revenue. I think we're estimating about 83% of our revenue be from liquids in 2012. ","Slide #7, we used this slide recently at a recent conference, so we did not show it at the last quarter's call. Just an update on our resource potential on Slide #7, significant proved reserves and resource potential. The big change is primarily in the Permian basin, primarily continuing to add deeper potential for the strong Mississippian and Atoka reserves, continued to see great results from our 20-acre drilling. And then, we added 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 3,000 horizontal Wolfcamp locations. This is only targeting the B -- the Wolfcamp B formation. Eventually, we'll be planning both A Wolfcamp and also, C Wolfcamp and eventually, some more clients over the next 12 to 18 months. So it's a huge upside potential to the 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent potential. ","Slide #8, investment highlights. With the divestiture of South Africa, we're now back to a solely 100% U.S. asset base. We have over 30,000 liquids-rich drilling locations, with over -- resource potential of over 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The third most active driller now, with our 2012 program, focused on 4 great plays, delivering one of the highest compounded annual production growth rate over the next 3 years and cash flow growth rate of 20% and 25%. ","With first quarter results, we expect easily to hit our target of 23% to 27% versus last year. Still vertical integration and doing a great job of saving cost. Whether it's pumping services, pulling units, drilling rigs, we're seeing substantial savings versus our peer groups on all the offset wells that we see, that we participate in. Then, finally we have a great set of hedges in place. Gas goes out to about 2014, great hedges in place. Oil starting to increase in 2014, but very high percentages in '12 and '13 and finally, a strong financial position, and we will continue that way. ","Let me turn it over to Tim to get into the operating assets.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. The first quarter, as he has already described, was a very strong operational quarter for the company. As opposed to the first quarter of 2011, we did not have any significant weather effects in the first quarter of 2012, and also, we  benefited because we maintained what was very close to the same rig count as we had at year-end 2011. So the result of that is we were able to bring out several operational efficiencies, such as Scott mentioned, for example, reducing the frac bank, which incrementally added production. ","My first slide is Slide 9, and on there, we were discussing the ramp-up in more detail regarding the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play. Scott has already alluded to, we're focused on the southern 200,000 acres where we're trying to preserve leasehold. Importantly, our first 2 wells in the Giddings area, shown in the red stars on the map, continue to flow naturally at very strong rates. In fact, the first of those 2 wells has already made 77,000 BOE in a little over 200 days. ","So that bodes well considering the vertical alternatives drilling into the Wolfcamp.  Generally speaking, we use a type curve of 140,000 BOE. So that gives you a view that these are very, very strong wells, and we still calculate that they are making roughly 7x what a vertical well would make in the same time period. That's for each of the 2 wells. That's very positive news. These wells continue to hold up, and actually, it's really an outstanding result. They continue to flow naturally at such strong rates. ","As Scott mentioned also, we drilled 3 wells in the first quarter in the horizontal play. And as he mentioned, we put 2 of those on production just in the last several days. We had some delay in putting infrastructure in place, and we're providing for the jet pumps and the equipment necessary for gas lift, and those are now in place and producing. As Scott mentioned, they're mostly producing water, but we are seeing oil cuts increasing on a daily basis. So we're excited to see how those wells finally work out. ","In a bigger picture sense, we're going to be drilling 9 more wells in the second quarter, as we ramp up with our 4 rig program, and we think it'll be about 2 or 3 of those wells will be getting on production by the end of the second quarter. The rigs that are coming to the rest of the year are already contracted. We plan to be at 7 by the end of the year and 10 in 2013 on average, and what that will allow us to do is to drill those 90 wells that would be necessary by the time -- the end of 2013 comes to have those wells on production. ","We did successfully add some bolt-on acreage, about 17,000 net acres in the southern area of the play. Some of that, of course, is necessary to provide for longer lateral lengths on the horizontals. So in a lot of cases, we're just acquiring adjacent acreage to current leasehold. So I will say overall, the horizontal Wolfcamp play is going extremely well. The drilling program is ramping up on schedule. ","Slide 10 then is regarding the vertical campaign. Vertical campaign is really the backbone of our current growth in the Spraberry Trend Area, and we continue to see significant contributions from the deepening of the wells. This slide, Slide 10, shows results from each of the 3 different zones that we're targeting. So for example, on the Strawn, we have 81 wells on production, with Strawn having been completed. We have always been in the thought area that we will be 30,000 barrels incrementally from the Strawn, and we continue to believe that. ","What has happened though is we now believe it was prospective on a little bit more of our acreage than we once thought after some new mapping. We originally had it targeted for about 50% to 60% of our acreage, and now we believe it's prospective along somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% to 70% of the acreage. Very strong results have been seen in the Atoka, where we put 29 wells on production, so really phenomenal zonal test we were just producing in the Atoka. ","You can see on the chart that we've had IPs in the 150 to 250 BOE per day rate from the one zone. So that gives you the idea they can have really significant potential in terms of adding to EUR, and we think the results we've seen to date still suggest a 50,000 to 70,000 BOE EUR add for the Atoka completion. And we still believe it's in the neighborhood of 25% to 50% of our acreage in terms of its prospectivity. ","Less activity in the Mississippi and about 8 wells put on production. We still see 15,000 BOE to 40,000 BOE, and it being prospective of something like 20% of our acreage. So the vertical campaign is very critical to our go-forward plan and particularly regarding deepening. You can see on Slide 11 that we've got a massive campaign in place for the deepening program, as we complete the rest of this year. ","As we have already discussed, we're currently running 40 vertical rigs in the play and will eventually decrease that to about 30 during the second half of the year, with the idea of accommodating the expansion of the horizontal campaign, which is much more capital-intensive. On the graph you can see the deepest interval to be completed. About 50% of the wells, for instance, will be  completed, with the Wolfcamp being that deepest interval. And you could see the rest of the table, the actual cost on a blended basis, and the returns are very strong. The cost incidentally is still being helped very considerably by our pumping -- Pioneer pumping services. We're saving over $200,000 per well by pumping our own wells. ","Now turning to Slide 12. Well, the bottom line is as a result of what I've just been discussing, this asset is hitting on all cylinders. You can see first quarter production about 62,000 barrels a day on a BOE basis. That's up 9,000 from the fourth quarter of 2011, which is at 53,000. Some of that, of course, is attributable to efficiency gains. During -- quite a bit of that period, we were running our frac fleets 24 hours a day, and also, to the extent we had a flat rig count, we were able to really bring out efficiencies, and related to that, we reduced our frac bank something like 40 wells, which added to the production in the first quarter. ","You can see here looking forward, and I think the first quarter is representative of this, we have an asset here that can grow substantially on a low-risk basis, predictable basis. That's why if you look forward to our planning numbers production, we think that we can either exceed these targets. ","Going to Slide 13 and turning to Eagle Ford. Well, the Eagle Ford Shale is also humming along, I would say. We drilled 28 wells in the first quarter. We have 26 wells on production. We still have a flat rig count, which is helping, again, from an efficiency standpoint. We're running 12 rigs. At one point, we thought we'd move into 14 rigs, however, we've dropped 2 rigs in consideration of low natural gas prices. ","In fact, of the 125 wells we're going to drill this year, only about 15% will target dry gas in strategic areas where we can preserve a lot of drilling locations for the future. That was originally going to be 25%. So in response to low natural gas prices, we have adjusted the well count and the rig count. We continue to see a lot of benefits from using white sand as a proppant. 45 wells have already been stimulated using white sand, and they look good as compared to their ceramic-stimulated offsets. It saves upwards of $700,000 or more on each well. ","So combining that with our vertical integration where we have 2 frac fleets running in the Eagle Ford Shale, we have a substantial cost advantage compared to our peers in that play. And importantly, we're on top of the infrastructure game, too. We added one more CGP, central gas processing facility, and have 2 more planned for the midpart of this year. ","And so we have really no bottlenecks that are in our way to grow production, as shown on Slide 14. We were up to 23,000 BOE a day in the first quarter, up from 20,000 in the fourth quarter of 2011. And so as I look forward to this, we think that we're on target with this year's guidance, and as we go forward, our rig count will be increasing as the current plan to 14 in 2013 and then upwards of 19 rigs in 2015. And so I think this growth is achievable in the Eagle Ford Shale as well. ","Turning to Slide 15, the Barnett Shale Combo play. It had a good operational quarter as well, drilled 9 wells, put 10 on production. That continued to be very consistent. We're doing some work in terms of making sure we can get water off these wells on a faster basis. We still plan to increase to 4 rigs next year. You may recall we held off, for the time being, moving to 4 rigs simply because in a low gas price environment the economics are affected negatively in this play since about 40% of the production is gas. I think we will probably move to 4 rigs next year in consideration of the need to preserve leasehold. ","And then the results of that, Slide 16, is about a 7% sequential growth in the Barnett Shale compared to the fourth quarter where we produced, in the first quarter, still about 6,000 BOE per day. But that'll be growing as we continue in the drilling campaign this year. We're on target for our full year guidance. And as the slide shows, we are contemplating going to those 4 rigs in 2013 ","I would note that all 3 of these key growth areas, we were talking about Spraberry Trend area, vertical and horizontal; Eagle Ford Shale; and Barnett Shale are all on target for the production growth, which gives us confidence in this year's forecast. ","Finally, some positive news. We have 40 in Alaska. Scott has already alluded to this, but I'll give you a little more detail on Slide 17. The Torok well that he mentioned, where we had a success, was drilled on 100% working interest basis to Pioneer. If you look at the map on Slide 17, you can see where this well was drilled as designated with a star, and this tested the southern extent of the accumulation. And to the extent this is a very positive well, one of the best wells we drilled on the Torok, making an IP rate of about 2,000 barrels a day. It gives us confidence we've added pretty substantial resources, maybe 50 million barrels of oil. ","We produced the well for several days, and we're, of course, forced to move off the ice in the face of the breakup as the weather was warming. But as Scott mentioned, we probably will look at potentially producing this well next winter and testing it further in doing so and potentially drill another well in this area to firm up our development planning. ","The Ivishak exploration well was unsuccessful. The principal target being the Ivishak zone was wet. It did have some gas in another zone, but gas in this area is basically noncommercial, so this well was P&A. The drilling campaign on the island continues where we have one rig drilling a series of different zones, including the Torok. Interestingly, the most recent Nuiqsut well, was completed with a mechanically diverted frac, made 4,000 barrels a day, by far, our best Nuiqsut well. And that's very encouraging looking forward because we think this style of drilling and completion we can also use in applicability for other Nuiqsut development wells going forward. ","So in summary, I'm going to stop there. But the first quarter was a very strong operational quarter for Pioneer, I didn't mention it and we should mention it more. But we couldn't have accomplished this kind of production growth without a very solid performance in our other gassier areas, so here I'm speaking, of course, of Raton, Mid-Continent and our south Texas Edwards teams, which all did a phenomenal job in the quarter. ","So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Rich for a discussion of the first quarter financials and the second quarter outlook.","Richard P. Dealy","Great. Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 18. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $215 million or $1.68 per diluted share. It did include a couple of unusual items that are listed on the page, as well as unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains. If you adjust for those items, our earnings was $153 million or $1.23 per share. ","Looking at the bottom of the slide, Scott and Tim both talked about production and the good results there. A couple of items just to note, exploration abandonment for $53 million for the quarter does include the unsuccessful well that Tim talked about in Alaska for $19 million and included seismic that we acquired in the horizontal Wolfcamp and Barnett Shale for $11 million. ","G&A at $63 million really reflects the increase in staffing that we've done to support our growth and then some restricted stock retention awards that we've done, as well as the timing of some Cherouq [ph] donations that were front-end loaded in 2012. On current income taxes, the only difference there being $12 million as we now are projecting to pay some AMT tax in 2012, and that's the reason for the increase. ","Turning to Slide 19, price realization. On the bar charts there, you could see that oil was up 8% from the fourth quarter to $99.15. NGL prices were down 8.5% to $41.81 per barrel, really reflecting lower ethane and propane prices throughout the quarter. And as you guys are aware, gas prices were down 26% to $2.51 per Mcf. ","Now looking at the bottom of the slide, you can see the impact of the VPPs. And as you recall, they do run off at the end of this year so those will go away, and then there's a small impact that's related to derivatives that are included in our prices, and those also run off at the end of the year. So really after this year, all we'd be left with is derivatives, and you can see the impact based on our derivative portfolio. ","Turning to Slide 20, production cost. The message here is that production cost has been flat for the past year. The asset teams continue to do a great job in managing those costs, and so we look forward for that to continue. ","Turning to Slide 21, on guidance. Production guidance for the second quarter, 149,000 to 154,000 BOE per day, so we continue to ramp up on the production side. Exploration abandonment of $25 million to $50 million does reflect some carryover activity on Alaska, that unsuccessful well that was -- activity in April that will hit the second quarter, and then incremental Wolfcamp and Barnett Shale seismic that will be shot in the second quarter. The other items are consistent with first quarter results or past guidance, so they're there for your information. I won't go through each one individually. ","But that really concludes my comments. So at this point, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly with respect to the inventory of wells in the frac bank that came online, can you just give us an estimate of what that meant to quarterly production?","Timothy L. Dove","The 40 wells that I've discussed, Dave, contributed about 1,000 to 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then with your comments on Alaska and the success you guys had with the Torok well, comments that you're going to go ahead and continue the drilling program next winter. Previously this, I guess, has been discussed as a potential divestiture candidate. Is that off the table?","Scott D. Sheffield","We're finding out that the diverted fracs on both the Torok, and also Nuiqsut. We have several more candidates on the Nuiqsut, and we are going to be evaluating that over the next several weeks and months to determine if there's a strong potential we could really ramp up production growth in that area. And it looks like that we may definitely be needing to drill another Torok well next winter.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that. And then just one kind of thinking more about the service cost side of things. Obviously, you're vertically integrated both in the Eagle Ford and the Permian and feels like there's pockets of softness on the service side in the Eagle Ford but definitely firmness in the Permian. Can you talk about whether you would or could redirect your vertical integration teams, efforts, equipment from the Eagle Ford to the Permian so you could take advantage of any kind of cost weakness that's taking place in the Eagle Ford versus the Permian?","Timothy L. Dove","Dave, this is Tim. Let me just say this first of all, we are noticing in certain areas a little bit of softness when it comes to pumping services, but in general, that's coming off a very high peak. We're basically insulated from that, as you might guess, mostly because in the Eagle Ford Shale we have 2 of our own fleets running, as well as a third-party fleet, which suffices for all of our drilling campaign this year. So those activities will take care of our drilling campaign there. In the Permian basin, we have 5 of our own fleets going to 6 here shortly this summer -- and actually 6 going to 7, I guess, when we consider the last one coming in. And my point there is we are self-sufficient to a great extent now in the Permian basin. So we're still making quite a lot of money on VI related to the fact that we can still do this cheaper than we're being charged by third parties. We still have very large savings after even a little bit of softness in both of these areas.","Operator","We'll move on to Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess just curious a little bit on the horizontal program in the Permian. Obviously, the thought process was to ramp that up while you kind of ramp down the vertical program. Is there any ability or desire to, I guess, accelerate those efforts at all in 2012? And if not to fully accelerate them, maybe just to pull forward some of the horizontal activity, is there any ability to do that?","Scott D. Sheffield","Well, we're already in the process of accelerating the horizontal Wolfcamp activity. We're moving up to 10 rigs fairly quickly over the next few months.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I'm saying about even further than current plans.","Scott D. Sheffield","Our focus right now -- I mean, obviously, we continue to make great wells like we have in Giddings, then we will continue to, going into '13, '14, '15, probably look at accelerating the Wolfcamp program. We'll eventually need to be going north in the Midland county. We need to be drilling some Wolfcamp A zones, C zones and D zones. So this is probably a good chance, but we need more data points. And we would like, at some point in time, if we see our oil prices, to be able to keep a good strong vertical program going. Right now, we're going to 30 rigs starting later in the summer on the vertical program, but we'd like to run a little bit more than that. We might be able to get back up to 40 sometime in the next year or 2. So we'd like to be able to move the rig count up on both sides over the next 2 to 3 years.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, in the Eagle Ford, I'm just curious on the 125 wells. Are all those planning to be tied into sales? And is there kind of a back-loaded nature to that?","Timothy L. Dove","No, I think we'll be doing it ratably throughout the year. You can see that we've had a good start on that first quarter, and I think that will just continue as we drill with the same number of rigs throughout the entire year. Kind of the frac bank there is -- we can easily handle our frac bank there with the 3 fleets, so it will be very steady as she goes.","Operator","From Stephens, Will Green has our next question.","Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you guys could help break down kind of the $8 million to $9 million on kind of the science wells for this horizontal Wolfcamps, how those get to $6 million to $7 million. How should we think about kind of, I guess, the sum of parts, for lack of a better term, with the 8 to 9 and then the same for 6 to 7?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, if you look at the science wells compared to what we consider to be more of a traditional development well, the way it calculates out is this, the drilling just because we won't be needing pilot holes and we can more quickly drill the wells, we think would be $700,000 less, especially when we're developing drilling mode. We also do cores in these wells typically from a science standpoint. That's about $500,000 or so. We have micro seismic typically done as we're trying to understand how the fracs propagate, and that's about $400,000. We do extra and very significant logging suites, which is about another $400,000 compared to what you were doing on a development well. So when you're done, that's $2 million, which is really not necessary in connection with just normal development drilling.","Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, how can I think about the drilling versus the completion side of that final cost?","Timothy L. Dove","What the split is, is your question?","Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes.","Timothy L. Dove","Where in a 6 to -- let's say, $6 million to $7 million well, it'll be about a $2 million completion is the current thinking. The rest of that will be drilling.","Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I wonder if you guys could touch on your current thoughts on takeaway capacity in the Permian. How should we think about the differentials in the Permian now? And then, going forward, do you think that there's enough midstream that's coming online to really take care of that? I wonder if you guys could just touch on that.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Over the next 2 areas, there's enough expansions right now with Plains All American Basin Pipeline and the Magellan line coming on the first quarter next year, and it was good to see -- I think you'll see something eventually come out of the Energy Transfer acquisition of SUN because that western gulf line could probably easily be expanded. I think that's the next major thing that you'll see once that acquisition is completed by Energy Transfer. We still need another 400,000, 500,000 barrels a day by 2020 to get to 2 million barrels today. But I don't see really any big issues for the next couple of years. So we need to get some other lines in place by 2015 really to solve the next big increase. The Permian is growing at about 150,000 barrels a day of oil per year. I think there shouldn't be any issues. The recent WTI, West Texas, versus Cushing has come back within $3 or $4. I'd like to see it get back to about -- obviously, it went back $0.50 to $1 dollar. But it has come back off that $8 to $9, and most of the maintenance projects turnarounds have been completed at the refineries that are in the area.","Timothy L. Dove","Just one more note related to that is on the gas side, you may remember we are expanding our Midkift\/Benedum facility with Atlas by 100 million cubic feet a day in early 2013, and potentially, that amount again by the end of 2013. So Scott didn't touch on the gas side, but we're well in advance of any issues on gas by those expansions.","Operator","We'll move on to Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Two questions for me. The first just on the 2 wells you've drilled so far on the horizontal Wolfcamp, do you have a preliminary estimate for an oil and gas mix on the EURs of those 2 wells?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, it's 90% liquids. We're still going with 80% oil, 10% NGLs, 10% gas on the reserve mix. And so it's only -- we haven't seen it change. It's been fairly steady at those splits for the first 6, 7 months, full months.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, just secondly, thinking about Q2 guidance as almost flat with 2012 guidance, how do we think about the back half of the year? Is there a reason to think that production will continue to stay flat? Is it just really vertical rigs going down on Spraberry offset by some Wolfcamp upside?","Richard P. Dealy","No, it's a combination of the frac bank. You remember the frac bank was -- came down significantly first quarter in the Permian basin. And also, we'll be ramping up the -- I mean, ramping down the vertical from 40 to 30 rigs. All the major items, that's why you're not going to see a big ramp-up second quarter.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on back half of the year?","Richard P. Dealy","Yes.","Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","So at the end of this quarter, how many wells were left waiting on completion in, I'll use the word, frac bank?","Timothy L. Dove","The Permian basin were 60 to 70 wells in the frac bank at the end of the quarter; Eagle Ford Shale, about 10; Barnett, 3 or 4, 5 wells.","Operator","Next question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Quick question on Alaska. Obviously, some nice drilling success this quarter. Do you guys expect production to go up at all this summer? Or is that something more we have to kind of wait for next winter? I know it's been hanging in there around 4,000 barrels a day.","Scott D. Sheffield","The Torok well that Tim and I mentioned, Leo, is -- it was suspended, so it's not producing. But the Nuiqsut well is still producing 4,000. We've been doing it for about 2 or 3 weeks. We just need to watch it. Obviously, if it does -- if it hangs in there in the 4,000 range or even 3,000, we should get a nice bump, obviously, over the next several months.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. In terms of your Wolfcamp program, you guys had originally talked about having 200,000 acres in the southern Midland basin, your big focus area. Visually, in your, slides, you've been saying 400,000 acres of potential. What gives you confidence in that additional 200,000 acres there?","Scott D. Sheffield","If you just move -- if you just count the Giddings. If you look at that map, our map of the 200,000 southern acres is sort of south of Giddings. So the Giddings well is -- essentially, if you move to east of Giddings and stay south of Midland county, that's how you get to the 400,000 acres. So the Giddings well sort of sets that up. The 200,000 acres originally came from all the offset operators: EOG, Approach, El Paso's drilling and Devon's to the south, so that was the original 200,000 acres. Those are in the, basically, the 4 boxes on Slide #9. But in Giddings, you can see we have a massive amount of acreage around Giddings and back to the east. That's how you get to the 400,000, adds another 200,000 acres.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, in the Wolfcamp you picked up more acreage this quarter. Any estimate of how much additional acreage you think you'll have to pick up over time in order to make all your drilling units?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's hard to tell. We have still some offers out there. I think a lot of deals over time are going to be farm-out and may be less acreage. I think some people have indicated they want to drill with this, but we don't want to put additional rigs to work. So I think it'll probably come-- I don't think we'll do 17,000 acres second quarter, for instance. It may come in third or fourth quarter some more acreage. But we'll probably see more and more farm-outs over time also over the next couple of years as this play develops.","Operator","Next question will come from Brian Corales with Howard Weil.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And maybe more big picture. I mean, as we look at the presentation, all the core areas in Texas move up into the right. And it seems like you almost -- could potentially have unlimited inventory in the Permian. I mean, how do you allocate capital going forward? And is there a way to accelerate that? And how willing are you to kind of lever up the balance sheet a little bit?","Scott D. Sheffield","As I've mentioned over the last several weeks, at Joe's [ph] conference and other people's conferences that first of all, we need to really prove up. We're excited about the Wolfcamp play. We really need to prove it up, and then we have, obviously, several items' access to us. Whether it's a JV or whether it's capital markets or whether it's potential divestitures down the road, we will look at all of those. And so it is going to be a good year before you make a decision on any of those items and decide, and it could be more cash flow from higher oil prices or better growth rates. So we're just going to evaluate all the opportunities, Brian, at this point in time.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And what's your comfort level? I mean, the balance sheet is obviously pretty clean. Is there a certain metric that you look at like debt to EBITDA? Or where the comfort level is for you guys?","Scott D. Sheffield","We're going to hit debt to EBITDA of 1 next year, in 2013, and so we like to -- most of our peers that are around us and above us, our at 1 or better. So we feel like that's a great target to stay within. So as our cash flow goes above that, then we don't mind using some of the balance sheet as long as it stays debt to EBITDA of 1 or less.","Operator","Next question from Stifel is Amir Arif.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. The 3 horizontal Wolfcamp wells you drilled in Q1, where those also targeting the B bench? Or have you started already targeting  some of the other benches out there?","Timothy L. Dove","Those were all B-bench-targeted.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, when do you start one? I know you talked about starting to target some of the others, does that happen in 2Q? Or is that a '13 event?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think it's about end of the year, the A.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The end of the year. And then, as you ramp up to 10 rigs on the horizontal side, that can be enough -- that should be enough to capture the 200,000 acres. But now that you're talking about 400,000 acres, do you need to accelerate further? Or is that held by production, the other 200,000?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. It's only 50,000 acres that we have expiring. So that's what the focus is. The 50,000 is within the 200,000 that we talked about, the southern part of the play. We do have 50,000 acres expiring by November 2013. So the rig count is designed to hold those 50,000 acres. It preserves about 400 drilling locations.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just a final question on the vertical rig count. As it goes down from 40 to 30, which kind of wells are you not going to be drilling, the deeper ones or is it certain geographical areas? Or how are you thinking about that?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's probably going to most likely be -- our returns are better as we go deeper. So if we do drop some, it will be wells that are targeting the bottom of the Wolfcamp.","Operator","Moving on to Sven Del Pozzo with IHS.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","My question, what are the main factors that make you think the C1 and the D bench of the Wolfcamp more localized than what you've been drilling so far in the horizontal Wolfcamp?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's primarily due to our extensive array of log data and core data that we have than most peers. We've been in the field for 50 years, and we just have the largest set of data. We've done lots of work over the last 2 or 3 years, and so we feel like the D and the C is more localized than certain areas. The A and the B is more widespread. And the A and the B have much more oil in place, also based on that same data.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","And what about silica content?","Scott D. Sheffield","Silica content, I think, we have a good slide, I don't know if it's in this presentation. Is it in back?","Timothy L. Dove","It's in the Doug [ph] Conference one.","Scott D. Sheffield","It's a slide that we show compared to other shale plays, and we have very, very strong silica content throughout, especially the A and the B. I can't answer about the C and the D zone.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And then 140 acre spacing I've seen for the horizontal Wolfcamp, is that just including one bench?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. 1 billion barrels is just one bench, 140-acre spacing.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. Then back to that previous question about the science wells versus development wells and the difference in cost. If you've already got course from older wells, are those -- is that $400,000 in savings right there for a development well?","Timothy L. Dove","We're coring wells in some of these newer areas to the south where we don't have as much data because we have not been doing as much vertical drilling. As you may remember the vertical campaign starts to pewter out as you go south in terms of productivity of the wells. And so therefore, we don't have quite as much data in the south. That's why we are spending money on science in the early part of this campaign. Most of the science drilling will be done by this summer.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. Depletion expense. It looked like DD&A just stayed flat or even down sequentially in the quarter even though production went up. Wondering why.","Richard P. Dealy","It's just on a per BOE basis that it stayed flat. And then as you recall, we had an impairment charge in the fourth quarter for south Texas and so that lowered that depletion rate.","Sven Del Pozzo - IHS Herold, Inc","Okay. And very last question, your NGL realizations still seemed pretty strong despite the spot market price decline. What are some of the reasons for that?","Richard P. Dealy","Really nothing out of the ordinary just business as usual. We've been selling  in the same market. A weak ethane and propane prices, but other than that everything else was -- we probably got a little benefit because oil prices were higher, so the heavier end of the stream was better realizations.","Operator","Moving on. From Global Hunters, Dan Morrison.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But the stage frac in Alaska, what was the cost on that well?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think we spent -- on the 2 Alaska wells, we spent a little over $50 million or 100%. 100% on both wells.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","You said you thought you had several more locations.","Scott D. Sheffield","That was on the Nuiqsut. Nuiqsut, we are reaching from the island. It's a primarily reserve base producing formation off the island, and the Nuiqsut well that made 4,000, it was a -- had plug and perf technique off the island, and that's where we have several more potential candidates we'll be looking at.","Operator","We'll move on to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.","First, on the Eagle Ford midstream, there's some people off to the west of where you guys are talking about problems with a Regency and a Kinder processing facility. Another is off to the west to you. But my question is will you, in any way, be affected by that? And if something like that would happen closer where you guys are, would your CGP going to insulate you from the effects of that?","Timothy L. Dove","The answer to your first question is no, no effect from any of their issues. Secondly, we're working with different set of parties in terms of offtake, and actually the big news for us is we're having our own oil pipeline midpart 2012 as opposed to being trucked today. But we don't have any kind of those infrastructure issues. We are, as you know, Charles, sort of have a leadership position because we're the first mover on all this infrastructure.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C.","Right, great. Good to hear. Second question, on the -- this is another horizontal Wolfcamp question. One of your competitors talked about a horizontal Wolfcamp well they drilled in southeast Ector County, so well to the northwest of the activity you and EOG and everyone else has been targeting. I believe they said it was in the Odessa south area. I know you guys aren't focused on that right now, but could you offer any commentary if you have a view if the trend would extend that far because if it does then you're talking about a lot more than 400,000 acres?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, that well, I think, it was about first 30 days, if I recall the note I read, our 2 Giddings wells is about 50% better than that well on the first 30 days. The rate looks pretty good but that's pretty much where the Wolfberry play was coined over the last 3 or 4 years on the west side of the play. And so the Wolfcamp does go up that far. We don't think the maturity and the depth is as good as the center part of the basin. There's also -- we've been asked there are several people drilling wells now in Terry County, way to the north. If they find it out in Ector County and find it out in Terry County, it's going to be in 3 million, 4 million acre play. So it's going to even -- the number is going to be even greater than what you're saying, so we just got to wait on results. So you got Glasscock and people moving east and Glasscock looking for the Wolfcamp. And they're going way north, and now they're going west. We still feel like the center part of the play, where our acreage is, is the best part.","Operator","Moving on to Rehan Rashid with FBR.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Have you got any thoughts on what portion of your acreage is exposed to the Cline?","Scott D. Sheffield","We have a lot of fine acreage in Glasscock County. I would estimate 100,000 to 130,000 acres. We have a good potential, but right now it's just -- we show less oil in place on our data points. It still looks like it could be a good play. But we're going to be focused primarily on holding this acreage and eventually drilling mostly in the center part of our acreage where we think the best maturity is, better reservoir pressures, less clay content, higher quartz, silica. And so that's where you'll eventually see us do most of our drilling, but that's going to be focused on the A and B. We'll let the other operators prove up the Wolfcamp D or the Cline on the eastern side.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And going back to Alaska real quick. So is that sometime next year where we had a point whether we decide to keep Alaska as a long-term quorum asset or kind of jettison it, any thoughts on timing to come to that decision?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. As you noticed the production has been flat or on a decline in the last 12 months. If the team up there can show us they have huge potential to grow production and frac several more Nuiqsut wells and look at some Torok, then we'll look at keeping and keep growing it. And so that's the key, do we have enough upside on growth to able to reinvest the cash flow and grow the asset. And we love growing assets.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But do you get to that point middle of next year, late next year in terms of making that decision?","Scott D. Sheffield","That decision we can make it down the road, yes. We have that decision in all of our assets.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, Brian Singer has our next question.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But can you just talk to where within your Permian position you're acquiring the 260 square miles of 3D seismic and what you hope to take from that? Is that within the 200,000 acres that you've already deemed prospective or is that towards expanding -- or 400,000? Or is that towards expanding that reach?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, it's mostly Upton, Reagan County right now, and it's obviously to identify faults to make sure we stay away from faults, primarily.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, on the Barnett Combo, can you just kind of talk about that asset in the context of what you're seeing in the Permian? And whether that -- you've identified a major -- identified that asset as a source of growth over the next couple of years, but how does that rank in terms of scale strategically versus the Permian? And in the context of potentially accelerating the Permian, is that a potential candidate for divestiture?","Timothy L. Dove","Brian, I'd just say that, at this point in time, we're in the process of ramping up Barnett, with -- the drilling campaign is going to increase next year. I really look at it as a fourth leg on a stool, if you will, in terms of production growth in Texas. And we've got an excellent team in the Barnett Shale Combo play that's uncovering a lot of the puzzle, and so we're doing an excellent job of growing production there looking forward. And I would really see it as 1 of our 4 growth assets in Texas and probably planning to keep it that way.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, lastly, you touched on this a little bit earlier in terms of the potential -- the cost reductions that will be coming in the horizontal Wolfcamp as you do less science. When would you expect to achieve that? Is that something that you think is a year out, 6 months out? When do you -- when should we expect that?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think by the end of the first half of this year, Brian, we will have most of the science wells drilled or we've collected data in -- where we're going to be drilling the majority of the wells in the south. And at that point, we'll go to more of a development drilling style of campaign.","Operator","We'll take a follow-up question from Dan Morrison with Global Hunter.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Back to the crude oil takeaway issues in the Permian. Have you all got access on the Longhorn system of any capacity? Or is that pretty much held by marketing companies?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. We do have some takeaway capacity. I don't know if we disclosed it . Have we?","Timothy L. Dove","No, we haven't.","Scott D. Sheffield","We can't disclose it due to our agreement with Magellan, but we do have -- we did take away specific takeaway capacity on that pipeline.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the conference back over to you, Mr. Sheffield, for any closing additional remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again, thanks for listening to another great quarter. We look forward to seeing you out on the road or the conferences. Or the ones -- we'll see you at the next quarter. Again, have a great spring, early summer. I hope it's hot in certain areas so we can burn some more natural gas. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Thanks Ebony. Good day, everyone, and thank you all for joining us again this quarter.","I am going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim's going to be up first. He will provide the financial and operating highlights for the fourth quarter of 2016 and in fact all of last year. As Tim commented in our earnings press release improving capital efficiency, strong execution and maintaining a great balance sheet, allowed the company to deliver one of the best years ever in Pioneer's 20-year history. Tim will also review our plans for 2017 and outline his vision of where he expects the company to be in 10 years.","After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp which is resulting from our successful completion optimization program and improving capital efficiency.

Lastly Rich will cover the fourth quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the first quarter. After that of course as we always do, we'll be glad to take your questions.","So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Dove","Thanks Frank and welcome to everyone to our fourth quarter and yearend 2016 conference call. As Frank mentioned, 2016 was one of our really best years. This summer will be the 20th anniversary of Pioneer as a creation. We look back at 2016 as one of the best years in that 20-year history where we met virtually all of our financial and operating goals for the year.","That's despite the fact, we're in a continuing downturn in commodity prices, but today we'll focus on our fourth quarter results, our year-end reserve data that was put out yesterday as well as our review of the 2017 capital budget that we also announced yesterday. Subsequent to that, I'll provide some commentary on a new vision for Pioneer for the next 10 years that we're very excited about.","So first I'll start on Slide 3, the bullet points are self-explanatory to some extent, but we had a great fourth quarter of adjusted income of about $85 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Our production for the quarter was 242,000 BOE per day. Once again for another quarter at the top end of our guidance range, in this case it was a range of 237 to 242.","We increased production again versus the third quarter. Importantly, that was our seventh consecutive growth quarter since the downturn began and that's important because we kept advancing the company during the downturn, making us even that more ready to efficiently execute the plan as pricing improves.","The total year production averaged 234,000 BOE per day increasing oil content to about 57%. That was also at the top end of our guidance for 2016. If you remember during the year, we continually up the percentage growth number and this was at the very top end of the range as it turned out for the year. Importantly oil production was up substantially about 28,000 barrels a day versus the prior year.","Our growth continues to be focused on the Permian operations. We had a great year there in 2016 with production up 36% and oil production up 42%. It just give you the vision of the massive underlying or organic growth engine that we have in the Permian basin.","At the same time, we're proud to say we dramatically reduced our production cost per BOE almost 30% compared to the prior-year. That's because of a substantial number of cost reduction initiatives while at the same time bringing on more low-cost horizontal Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells.","As was reported in a separate press release yesterday, we had a great year in terms of reserve replacement. Over 230% drill bit reserve replacement that's adding over 200 million BOE's last year at a drill bit F&D cost of about $9.59 that's essentially the cost of adding new reserves and a proved developed F&D cost just over $9.00. That's basically the cost of placing wells on production. So, this was really an outstanding year for reserve replacement for the company as will. Overall great year in terms of new reserves and production based on strong economics.","Let me turn to Slide 4, hedging has always been a very important part of our strategy. We added about $2.6 billion of value in the form of cash and since 2009 from the program and 2016 was another excellent year in that regard and that we provided incremental cash receipts of about $680 million.","We end the year with probably one of the strongest if not the strongest balance sheet in the entire energy complex with about $3 billion of cash on hand. Outstanding low debt numbers as shown on the slide with debt-to-book capitalization a net basis of about 2%.","We did as we discussed last year add rigs to the point we exited on the number at 17 rigs at the end of the fourth quarter as we had anticipated earlier. We did place 66 wells on production in the Permian area during the fourth quarter that was the expected number. Importantly, 38 of those were Version 3.0 wells. As we said, we increased the number last year of total 3.0 completions on the basis of how successful we had been and we'll show you some more results of that later when Joey covers his slides, but the fact is Version 3.0 completion continues to outperform our Version 2.0 wells.","We've done a great job I think if you look back in terms of completion optimization, adding longer lateral lengths, enhancing well productivity, the idea being capital efficiency gains in the field and we continue to drive down costs. That's extremely important even as we look ahead.","The 2016 drilling and completion expenses actually came in slightly below budget while production was above the top range of guidance. So, it gives you a feel that we're really hitting on all cylinders when we can say that.","We're really excited about having signed in December with the City of Midland a new water contract that has us upgrading one of their water facilities and in doing so this is really a game changer for our long-term water supply in that for the next 25 plus years, we'll be taking a substantial amount of water that's effluent water from this plant, some 240,000 barrels a day, which is really going to help as we look forward to prosecuting these many years ahead of us.","We are becoming a bigger exporter. We're glad the export ban is lifted because it's pretty clear as you look forward at Pioneer and the rest of the domestic industry will be significant swing producers in terms of worldwide supply and toward that end, we're exporting two 525,000 barrel cargoes to Asia in the next couple weeks and so we're beginning a period in which we are seeing this export becoming important part of our goals going forward. So, in summary 2016 was simply an outstanding year of accomplishments both from an operational and a financial standpoint.","Turning to Slide 5, here we're looking forward to this year's plan, this year's capital plan and it calls for us to operate to 18 horizontal rigs in the basin, 14 of which will be in the northern area. We have one more that will be added here shortly to make it 14 and four rigs in the Southern Wolfcamp JV area, that'll be a focus in the northern portion of the JV area where we see similar well results as in the actual northern acreage.","The Version 3.0 completions will be the predominant way the wells are completed. It's based on the success that we've already seen in the program to date. We will be at the same time beginning to process the planning for larger completions during 2017. I don't have a number for you yet of whether that's Version 3.5 or Version 4.0, but the fact is we're going to replevin more sand and allow these wells higher fluid volumes and continue to test cluster and stage length spacing in addition to furthering our well spacing tests.","And so, this is important and particularly important in scenarios where we are drilling only 7500-foot laterals. Our preference of course is to drill 10,000-foot laterals, but there are times when the lease configuration limits us to approximately 7500-foot laterals. This is where the larger completions could make a lot of sense going forward.","We'll begin with about 10 plus wells in that category of something in excess of 3.0. We are to be growing production substantially from the Permian growth engine. Production expected to grow 30% to 34% this year as compared to last year. Again, oil production being the predominant amount of the increase.","Ken Sheffield is going to be on here in a minute to talk more about this topic, but we are planning to complete 20 wells in the Eagle Ford this year, getting back to drilling in the case where the new drills 11 wells and we're going to complete nine wells that have been drilled earlier and complete those wells this year as well. So, we're looking forward to seeing the results of that and Tim will give you some more color on that in a moment.","But the objective of the program is to test longer laterals and put higher intensity completions on these wells. The idea is to make the completions in Eagle Ford more akin to our Permian style 3.0 completions then we have done in the past.","Switching now to our West Panhandle Field, our Fain plant throughput is in the Panhandle of Texas has fallen to the point where it makes sense for us to process this gas in third-party facilities and this will have the benefit for us of eliminating some of the plant upsets we've been experiencing for the last few months at Fain.","So, we're looking forward to actually transferring this into third-party facilities give us more consistency when it comes to processing. The 2017 campaign is going to add significantly again in terms of production. We're calling the range 15% to 18% and that's with a 62% oil content per production as an average for the company, but it really is the result of drilling horizontal wells with high oil content and high returns in this year's program.","And importantly our returns are IRRs are expected to range from 50% to 100% and that's burdened with facilities costs. So, the returns are excellent based on the fact that we've been able to improve efficiencies, drive down costs and expect that to continue.","Let me turn now to Slide 6, this is a little bit more discussion regarding the capital plan for 2017. We arrived at a $2.8 million capital program, which is $2.5 billion for drilling and completions and $275 million for various vertical integration projects. I'll touch more on that in the next slide.","We are assuming overall from the standpoint of what we've been hearing in the industry as being discussed an overall notional cost inflation probably in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% for the year. I believe we'll be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5% but the internal plan is to make sure that those -- that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains, which we've been able to prove for quite a long time now. So, we believe that overall our cost will newly not a net basis be affected by inflation on the basis of those efficiency gains.","We have substantial amount of cash flow this year about $2.2 billion. We'll supplement that with cash on hand to meet the capital budget. We as I mentioned earlier have been significant hedgers, probably one of the biggest hedge book in the industry over the years and today for 2017, our derivatives are at about approximately 85% coverage for oil this year and about 55% for gas.","The oil coverage gives us protection basically below about $49 to $50 and gives us upside to $62. On the gas side, our protection is about $3 and gives us upside to about $3.50. Again, we're going to keep our debt levels very low as you might guess in 2017 with net debt to cash flow below 1.0.","We have a couple things to report regarding a couple of smaller transactions, the first two of which are related to the former Devon properties. We agreed to sell some acreage in both Upton and Andrews Counties for about $63 million. We're still in the process of evaluating offers to sell about 20,000 acres up in Martin County and we also have opened a data room here in the month of late January to sell over 10,000 acres in the Eagle Ford.","As you might expect, we're getting strong interest in these assets and these packages and will be coming out with more information as we know it, but suffice it to say, our program for 2017 is positioning us well to be able to grow and get to a point in 2018 where we can spend within cash flow. Basically, the curve is crossed using current prices or using 55 and three for cash flow neutrality next year 2018.","Turning to Slide 7, this is more details particularly on the D&C plans for this year. I won't go into this in laborious detail, but predominantly of course this spending is in the Spraberry Wolfcamp area. It also includes incidentally coming back to a few zones, We haven't done much activity in over the last few years during the downturn including some more activities on few drill mill wells a few Wolfcamp D wells and our first well in the Clearfork, which is calculated as the shallowest of the pays and will sales in the Permian Basin. So, it will be very interesting to see what the results are as those drilling campaigns are prosecuted.","If you look at the Eagle Ford shale numbers, of course that has to do with the 20 well campaign that I discussed earlier. Other capital is going into some important projects and when it comes to our vertical integration, we are in the process of doing some refurbishment at some of our fleets as well as pressing our six fleet to go back to work this summer. So, that's some of the capital in the $275 million.","We also are moving smartly ahead on building out the main line in the subsystems for our water system in the Permian basin including our frac ponds. We're just going to begin spending on the Midland plant probably late in the year. It's not that substantial for 2017. The majority of that will come in 2018.","In addition, of course we're continuing to work on the efficiency of our existing sand mine in Brady and that will be the source of some of this capital as well going forward. I think the major investment in this will be at the time we decide to expand that mine which seems to be right now in terms of on production time near the end of the decade.","Now going to Slide 8, we just want to make sure that we could reconcile for you the net differences in this year's capital from last year. So, without going into too much detail here, you can see we came in below the $1.9 billion budget slightly last year and we have added two net rigs for the entire year on average, which adds about $200 million or so.","We are curious now being completed with Sinochem in the Southern Wolfcamp JV. So, that's a capital addition this year on a net basis. We will have more widespread activity. We have five new areas of the Permian were going to be drilling wells and so you can see we'll have incremental tank battery and saltwater disposal systems that are required.","But that's how you arrive adding a couple more areas including in the Eagle Ford at $2.5 billion for this year in terms of D&C and again as I mentioned we expected -- you know we don't have any inflation in these bars and that's because we think our efficiency gains will offset -- will be net 5% inflation torque average simply because of vertical integration.","Now let's see, turning to Slide 9 I alluded to in my initial remarks that we're rolling out a new vision for the next 10 years. This is something we have verbally been discussed in public forms as well as internally for some time now. But it's a view towards the next 10 years there probably can only be afforded companies like ourselves with our inventory of drilling.","The slogan as shown here in the box it's 1.10 million. It is the exact same slogan and vision we use with our employees. We rolled this out to all of our employees and the meaning is of course to reach 1 million BOE in the next 10 years. It's important to know, this is really not a change in strategy but it's simply a reflection of what we can accomplish based on our prolific acid-base particularly in the Permian Basin and it's reflecting organic growth that's really an important point as well.","We don't really need to put capital toward landgrabs or acquisitions to accomplish this. This is simply a number that is generated by drilling wells in our world-class asset in the Permian Basin. To give you an idea about this, we already have location selected for the next three years of drilling in the Midland Basin basically it sticks on the map.","So, the next three years we're essentially call it for from the standpoint of internal planning. You'll notice that we set in this slide here 15% plus. Obviously, that means we're targeting above 15%, but we can grow faster or slower than 15% simply depending upon the amount of capital we put to work. Of course, the objective is to efficiently process our inventory at the highest returns possible.","There is always attention of course to bring even more PV4, we know that. We have various ways we can do that in the future, but the internal goal is to show consistent growth at high returns and to do so within cash flow and with a pristine balance sheet. I guess you'd say embedded in this philosophy is our desire to avoid diminishing returns by overly reacting to price signals with our rig count.","Certainly, vertical integration and technology are going to be important components of this as we move ahead. And how about the financial implications of this? Our modeling shows as I mentioned earlier in my comments that we can begin to spend within cash flow in 2018 with a curved cross that's on a $55 and $3 case.","We're very confident about that and started to working towards as a goal for quite a long time and that puts us in a position assuming that price deck were to continue to be a cash flow generator in a positive sense after 2018 and so this is an important goal from a financial standpoint that we actually reached that point where we can say we can spend within cash flow and grow at 15% plus.","Actually, our cash flow underlying the 15% production growth is growing over 20%, that's due to the fact that we're mostly drilling very high return oil-based economic wells and at least two more returns based on the rate of growth. We will continue to be heavy hedger. It's important in a world we can't control commodity prices and I mentioned already we have a significant program in place for this year, but we've done very little for 2018 that's by design.","I think if we looked at the year, we would say as we progress through the year, we have a chance we believe where prices could be higher as we approach the latter parts of the year to be able to do hedging in 2018's and then where the prices are today. One important aspect and it's needless to say is the ability to process and execute this program despite what happens with commodity prices with a very pristine balance sheet, net debt to cash flow between below 1.0 throughout the plan period.","And the real bottom line about this is to look at our ROE and ROCE improvements. Basically, all this surrounds the idea of improving our returns. I think you'll see continuous improvement in the company's return metrics by executing on the plan the way we're talking about doing.","So, suffice it to say that's a very exciting time at the company when we can really talk about the next 10 years not many companies can do that. It has to do with our great employees. It has to do with great asset base, really some of the best rock in the industry and we feel very confident that we can pull this off. So, we're looking forward to the next 10 years in a big way.","So, my slide is Slide 10. it's about our production growth forecast a little bit of detail for both the first quarter and for 2017 in total. You can see that the production forecast as I mentioned earlier is 15% to 18%. In other words, we're pointing to the first year of our 10-year plan to hit a million barrels of BOE per day in 10 years averaging over 15% would be the objective.","So, that would lead us to a conclusion of a range of 269,000 to 276,000 BOE per day. That 15% growth rate of course through time gets us to the million barrels on a BOE basis by 2026. Importantly our oil content goes up. It's expected to be about 62% this year but you can calculate out easily it could be 70% when most of the new production after all these years of drilling is basically Spraberry Wolfcamp wells, which generally produce slightly over 70% oil. So, that's why that member gets to where it is.","So right now, I am going to pass it over to Joey for his more detailed review of the Permian operations.","Joey Hall","Thanks Tim. I am going to be picking up on Slide 11 and pleased to report on another great quarter for our Permian team to close out 2016. Continuing to see a solid uplift from our 3.0 wells which is resulting in a quick payout for the $500,000 to $1 million in committal cost associated with these larger completions.","It is important to note from the graph on the bottom that the Wolfcamp As do take a bit longer to show the same separation as the Wolfcamp Bs and this is just simply because of the lower pressure in the Wolfcamp A and the additional time it takes for these wells to clean up due to the larger water volumes.","Now I am going to move on to Slide five where we talk about our lower Spraberry shale performance, which continues to track the one million barrel type curve. We do have some completion variations planned for 2017, focused primarily on higher propane concentrations and modified fluid systems.","Moving to Slide 13, this is an updated format from past presentations, we're now including combined costs from all zones, going back to Q1 of 2015, where we had previously only reported Wolfcamp B costs. As you can see the D&C costs have trended down 25% even though we are pumping significantly larger completions then we were two years ago with as much as two times the water concentration and 35% more sand compared to Q1 of 2015.","Going on to Slide 14, you'll see the highlights of our 2017 plan where we plan to put approximately 260 gross wells online. Approximately 85% of those wells will be in the northern area with the remaining 15% in our southern joint venture. The distribution of zones we plan to develop in 2017 is very similar to 2016 between the lower Spraberry shale Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B and we also plan to do some appraisal in the Clearfork. Jo Mill and Wolfcamp D.","We have noted our expected well cost in EURs, but I would encourage everybody to take these projected EURs in the appropriate context keeping in mind that our development understanding of the lower Spraberry Shale and Wolfcamp A is far less advanced than that than the Wolfcamp B. So, we have a tendency to be on the conservative side.","In addition to that as Tim's already mentioned, we'll be going out into five new areas and so we're looking forward to getting more results in those areas. There will be a slight uptick in our tank battery and saltwater disposal construction cost for 2017. For contrast-only 16% of our 2016 pops needed new tank batteries while in 2017, 40% of our wells will go into new tank batteries.","I do want to point out that I expect those numbers to go back down to 2016 levels and lower in 2018 and 2019. As you can see by the last bullet this all rolls up to a very robust program with IRRs ranging from 50% to 100% at $55 oil and $3 gas.","Moving to Slide 15 you can see our plans for gas processing, water distribution and vertical integration to support our execution. I won't go over the details that Tim has already mentioned, but I will just simply say that we're looking forward to realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy for managing these dependencies, considering the general industry concerns over cost inflation incapacity in these areas as activity accelerates.","And I do want to point out that the bulk of our water system spending in 2017 is related to mainline expansions that will allow us to connect are numerous current and future water sources located throughout our acreage including the recently announced deal with the City of Midland to take non-potable water off the tail end of their wastewater treatment facilities similar to what we're doing in Odessa.","And now moving on to Slide 16 and my final slide, in Q4 we popped 66 wells an average to 188,000 BOE's per day and ended the full year with 236 pops at an average production rate of 171,000 BOE per day. This represents 36% growth over 2015 with all growth and 42%.","Looking into 2017, we are expecting an average production rate for the full year between 222,000 and 229,000 BOEs per day, resulting in a growth rate of between 30% and 34% over 2016 with all growth being between 33% and 37%.","Looking specifically at Q1, we plan to pop 45 wells, which is lower than the 66 wells we popped in Q4 and this is simply the cyclical nature of the 17 rig program with 125 to 150 days pop cycle times. There are simply just times when multiple rigs get in sync with one another and it forces you time to time to go through pop frenzies and at other times to go through pop droughts and also whenever you have a changing rig count, it adds to this complexity.","For example, our lowest rig count in Q3 was in Q3 of 2016. So, whenever you're changing rig count, it just tends to get cyclical. As an example, when I look back at 2016, we had as many as 27 pops in one month and as few as nine in another. Offset shut in due to frac operations work similar. There are times when you have a very high percentage of production shut in and other times when you have almost none.","Example here during 2016 there were months when we only had a couple thousand barrels a day shut in while there were others where we had over 20,000 barrels shut in. So, when you look at things over the full year, the law of averages works in your favor when you shrink things down to quarters and months, the law of averages doesn't work and there are going to be larger swings and pops in production.","So, with that, we're looking forward to a great year in 2017 for the Permian team and I am going to turn it over to Ken Sheffield to cover our Eagle Ford operations.","Ken Sheffield","Thank you, Joey and good day everyone. Turning to Slide 17, Pioneer will resume limited drilling and completion activity in our Eagle Ford asset beginning in the second quarter. We plan to complete and place on production 20 wells during the year, including nine drill and complete wells drilled about a year ago and 11 new wells where we will test design changes expected to significantly increase the recovery.","The design changes include over 40% longer laterals, averaging about 7500 feet, tighter cluster spacing and much higher profit concentrations which would yield to strong results in both Eagle Ford and Permian operation.","The cumulative effect of the design changes are expected to yield EURs in the range of 1.3 million barrels equivalent with IRRs ranging from 40% to 50% on the new wells. Well results in the second half of 2017 will drive future plans for the asset. The program will also moderate production decline with fourth quarter 2017 production expected to be about 20% below the same period last year.","I'll now turn it over to Rich Dealy to review financial results.","Rich Dealy","Thanks Ken and good morning. I am going to start on Slide 18 where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $44 million or $0.26 per diluted share that did include noncash mark-to-market derivative losses due to the higher prices that we had into December versus the end of September of $142 million or $0.83 per diluted share.","It also included an unusual item that was similar to what we had in the third quarter of tax credits related to research and experimental expenditures on our horizontal drilling and completion innovations, that was $13 million or $0.08 per diluted share. So, adjusted for mark-to-market unusual items, we were at $85 million or $0.49 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show our result relative to the guidance we put out, you can see that we're on the positive side of guidance or within guidance on everything other than G&A and that just includes some increment performance-based compensation that's included there. So as Tim mentioned, another strong quarter and really a great year for the company.","Turning to Slide 19, looking at price realizations, you see that all the prices for the quarter were up with oil being up 11%, NGL being up the most at 35%, really ethane and propane are our biggest two products. They were up really across the NGL complex. They were all products were up.","Gas was up 7% for the quarter. So, all those benefited from. The other thing is we talked about is big uses of derivatives. You can see that for the quarter, we had $147 million of incremental cash flow for the quarter and that brought the total as Tim mentioned 680 million for the year. So, continue to be strong use of derivatives and debt benefit the company.","Turning to slide 20, looking at production cost. I think if you look at it in total and back out production and one taxes in a more tied to commodity prices \u2013 production cost for the quarter were flat quarter-on-quarter. If you look at base LOE quarter-on-quarter its up slightly is mainly due to repair related to the issue that we had at West Pan field and on the Fain gas plant and little higher activity in the Eagle Ford and Permian vertical wells.","The other piece of it is you will see that third-party transportation cost were down, you can imagine the largest component of that is Eagle Ford transportation and that production continues to decline and becomes the smaller proportion of the overall company therefore on a BOE basis that is continuing to decline.","Turning to slide 21, looking at a liquidity position and the company is in excellent condition, excellent liquidity, the net debt is about $200 million, $1.5 billion undrawn credit facility so great liquidity position. If you look at our maturity schedule there on the chart you will see 2017, we have bond\u2019s coming due during March we plan on paying those-off with cash on hand and the next maturity in May of 2018 and we also you know based on today\u2019s outlook we\u2019ll pay those off with cash on hand, so excellent condition.","Flipping to slide 22, really or switching to the first quarter guidance production at 243,000 to 248,000 BOEs a day and the rest of these items are all consistent with the third quarter or other than DD&A, which we have adjusted for the higher year-end reserves that we had. So, all these are something you would have seen in the past -- to those in details","And with that I want to stop and we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Pearce Hammond with Simmons. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. My first question is can you elaborate more on your decision to deploy four rigs in the northern section of the JV area for next year? What are you seeing there that excites you, and how do these wells compare to your Northern Midland Basin acreage?","Tim Dove","Yeah, Pearce of course you know we have a partner there in the form of Sinochem. They\u2019ve been a great partner with us for many years. They have taken a decision last year to take high yields in terms of drilling and we agreed just basis what was going on with economics because we could also focus on the North.","That said we feel like it been tries and exceeded roughly to 50 in terms of the forecast that they want to come back and do some drilling and toward the end we have agreed to this four rig campaigns. I mention in my comments as you remember that most of that all of that drilling for that matter will be in the Northern part of the Southern acreage and we find it as the zones and the economics there essentially identical to many of the same areas in the North. So, we don\u2019t think there is any drop off standpoint of economics in fact we think they are identical and we are looking forward to the program.","Pearce Hammond","Great. Then my follow-up is what are your thoughts on Permian takeaway and emerging bottlenecks on that front? And what have you done to protect PXD against potential takeaway bottlenecks? And if they do materialize, at what level do you think this could move to?","Tim Dove","Well I think if you take a look at it right now and just do the math in terms of what we believe to be the current takeaway capacity that surplus, we think it something like 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil per day. That said of course there have been few expansion that have been already announced including rich tax and Cactus those total about 150,000 barrels a day.","So even if Permian volumes were to grow 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day which is probably the top 10 in terms how we view it in 2017 and in 2018. It looks like we have sufficient takeaway to be able to be ready for enterprises 450,000 barrel line which is going to come in as currently estimated second quarter 2018.","And the fact there is lots of other expansions and new bills on the consideration that total maybe another 500,000 barrels a day by 2019. So, this is something we continually work-on, we are working our door in the market view like a revolving door in terms of pipeline companies wanted to come in and work with us, in terms of moving volumes down their pipelines.","So, we are very confident that this is really not an issue in fact we will be looking forward to taking advantage of some potentially reduced rates going forward, they would allow us to be even more economic in terms of exports for example. So, we do not see an issue here, Pearce.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you, Tim.","Tim Dove","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Tim Dove","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. Tim, within the Permian, can you talk about the geographic choices you're making of where to place rigs and drill wells in 2017 versus 2016. And then also, s you think about the next decade, I guess, specifically, how does the acreage quality of the 2017 program compare, in your mind, versus 2016 and should we expect, over the next decade, that you drill the best portions of your acreage first and then work your way down?","Tim Dove","Yes, in terms of the campaign for 2017, there has been very specific areas we have not been drilling prior to now simply because typically two reasons; one is we didn\u2019t have seismic over the area. Seismic is needed in order to make sure that we can have some definition regarding the ability to avoid geologic risk such as faults or carc or whatever the case maybe. And so therefore the ability to make sure we get off good completions.","The second thing is we have not yet done any drilling in our major units that's because lot of land negotiations had to take place where we could consolidate all the interest and work with the parties that are our partners to make sure we have a go ahead plan that make sense.","These are areas and so definitely when I am talking about the units there were the subject to some of our very best vertical wells for years. And we have seen a strong correlation between how the historical vertical wells tied to new horizontal production, in other words good rock beget some good rock. And so we are looking forward to some of these new areas.","On your second question Brian, I will simply say, we don\u2019t see any degradation at all in terms of quality of this asset going forward. People talked about we are drilling the core the core really not. We've been focused on the Wolfcamp B, but the Wolfcamp B is basically prolific over a huge swap of the acreage, some 600,000 plus acreage in the core. ","And so, we don\u2019t see really any anticipated reduction. Now what we would say to you is some of those zones we'll be drilling as you get out 10 years from now may include less Wolfcamp B. That's why we are doing a lot of work here to further assist the Wolfcamp B, the Jo Mill. Even at point where we progress lower Spraberry shale and also the middle Spraberry shale. And you see some of the data we put out here is actually relatively conservative in that regard because we don\u2019t have lot as much well control as Joey mentioned in his comments. ","But I think what we are going to be doing is focusing on all these key zones and we are going to have 10 years of good quality drilling. I'm pretty confident just looking at the extensive aerial extent of the acreage. ","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is with regards to Slide 9. You've identified a number of long-term objectives here, including production growth, leverage, free cash flow and corporate return. Can you talk about any changes you and the board are making or considering making to long-term management incentive programs?","Tim Dove","I think at this point in time it would be pre-mature for me to discuss what would happen over many years, but I think our current incentive programs are quite positive. They basically have us aligned with the company's returns when it comes to the drilling of these wells and all the operating metrics surrounded that for annual compensation, long-term compensation. In our case is heavily focused on our returns to shareholders and that will continue to be the focus. I don\u2019t see any ground of activity on the board discussing anything other than that on a go forward basis.","Brian Singer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Tim Dove","Hi, Scott.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good morning guys. Just on that long-term outlook, Tim, in some of your conversation, you had mentioned looking at various metrics. And have you all looked at what return metrics are going to be really the focus going forward? Is there benchmarks on ROE or ROCE that you are targeting?","Tim Dove","First of all, the metrics they are really critical to us needless to say are the metrics on drilling. And you can see this year we have very strong metrics. We are realizing when the upstream companies make 50% to 100% rate of returns in the wells, it has to do with the high-quality rock and the cost efficiencies they were generating.","But we are also the ones taking the risk on drilling the wells and completing the wells also. So, that return metric has been something we have seen from time to time. And minimum we have seen through the years a return to the upstream of 35%.","And so, I'd say there, looking forward we'll be looking towards the turn metrics that would be well in excess of 35% to be able to prosecute the plan efficiently. When it comes to our ROCE and ROE metrics this is more complicated because it refers to past drilling campaigns, past results and effective price on those.","What I am going to tell you is, where are \u2013 our objective is substantially improve our ROCE and ROC numbers from where they have been, that\u2019s the goal and that will reflect that fact that we are drilling higher return wells. So, that\u2019s our number one focus. We have very specific goals for hitting ROE and ROCE targets every year.","Scott Hanold","Understood. That's great color. And as a follow-up, when you look at this long-term plan, can you give us a little bit of color around some of your hierarchy of your priorities, how you rank them? Obviously, that 15% growth seems to be fundamentally where you want to be initially. But as you look at other options like dividends and stock buybacks, how do those priorities line up? And are there specific ranges you would like to see as you start getting into that free cash flow time frame?","Tim Dove","First of all, let me just comment on what you said, which is the 15% growth rate, just to be as specific we are seeing 15% plus. So, 15 I would consider to be the bottom of the range and then we will see what we want to do as we move ahead with the plan, if not out of the range possibilities for us to increase numbers above that.","If we are able to do so, along the lines of the plan I outline, then of course do cross in 2018. That is a point where we would be spending an amount of capital essentially equivalent to our cash flow at some point next year. So therefore, keeping the same idea in mind, 2019 becomes the year where we would generate free cash flow."," It\u2019s obviously premature for us to give you any color on exactly what we would do with excess cash flow with serving a lot of options there are shareholders friendly options, there are acceleration options that we could consider we are looking at that is a high quality problem to solve, but we are not really going to make those decision until at that point, when we have the cash.","Scott Hanold","Understood, I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning gentlemen. My question, Tim, is maybe kind of a little bit of follow-on to Scott's, and that is you guys put out a great detail as far as what you're expecting, adding the one rig, the production growth you just suggested with quite minimal outspend. Is really the focus on that, is it more about the limited outspend?","I guess I'm trying to ask another way of these are prices where you would just -- given the returns you have on these wells and your outstanding cash balance and liquidity and leverage, are there thoughts about increasing that?","Tim Dove","Well I think right now of course we are already outspending a cash flow number of 2.2 billion by substantial amount, the whole objective of overspending this year and that for matter 2016 as prepare us for 2018. In other words, what we have been doing is investing in high quality, high rate of return projects to generate substantial cash flow additions with the focus then of generating a high degree of cash flow in 2018, which correspondence to a capital budget which is prosecuting that 15% plan, that\u2019s when the curves cross.","I think we are going to stick on our plan. I think you will see us continue with the current rig campaign throughout the majority of this year. We obviously in a 10-year plan where we are adding production, we\u2019ll be adding rigs to that time periods and we will be adding rigs in 2018 to that extent probably middle part of 2018 would be the current view, but that will be something we continue to assess. But suffice it to say right now we are stuck to our plan and we are moving ahead on this 15% to 18% growth for this year and preparing for 2018.","Neal Dingmann","Understood. Great. I really like the growth. And then just one follow-up. Export certainly are notable now, having even two cargoes in this first quarter. Again, what are you thinking for the rest of the year to that? How much more could that grow per quarter? I don't know. I'm not going to hold you per quarter. And then just what are the differentials on that? How does that differ versus what you're just receiving here in the States?","Tim Dove","Yeah, I think the expectation is based on our production continuing to grow. We would be exporting probably at a similar ratable quantity as we are doing here in the first quarter. It simply the case that we believe that there is an incremental value attach to this light sweet barrels going into international markets and I mentioned earlier that this first quarter set of cargos are going to Asia, we see opportunities in Europe and South America, Asia and so on to take these barrels into more transportation style, refinery complexes and through that end I think it will be continuing part of our plan, but are expected to be ratable this year, but I think as our production goes up and we execute this case of going to million BOE per day we need to be an exporter of 700,000 barrels a day when the time comes.","Neal Dingmann","Well, it's great to hear. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","And our next question will come from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. ","Charles Meade","Good morning, Tim, and to the rest of your team there. You probably added some good color on this 15% CAGR floor I guess as you're characterizing it now. But if we could explore that a little bit more, is that kind of a soft governor for you that you want to be up a minimum of 15%? And then what is the higher end of that range that you would contemplate before you would maybe accelerate some of these above-ground issues on your timeline?","Tim Dove","Sure, Charles. I think the fact is we are choosing about a 15% growth rate, because we think that's the number at which in excess of 15% we can grow very efficiently within the company. So, the concern will be that we don't mind adding some percentage increase growth above that, that's why we have 15% plus. We want to make sure if we do so we did not have diminishing returns.","In other words, we're going to maintain our process orientation with a rig count, which grows successively through time. And in doing so do it very efficiently at high returns. And the concern would be if we get too much of an acceleration mode you do have diminishing returns I think the industry steering it that right now.","The truth is as more rigs come back we're not in that situation, we've been operating through this downturn and we're essentially continuing to operate out of it. And therefore we're extremely efficient. We have all of our people working and we're going to be able to mitigate and allow this cost inflation. But you can see if you have to go out and accelerate guess what, you're going to see pretty significant inflationary costs, that's that we're trying to avoid.","Charles Meade","Got it. That's helpful, Tim. And then if I could go back to an intriguing comment you mentioned in response to Brian's earlier question. As you go into these five new areas, and presumably some of these -- or are these some of these -- those big units, some of the incremental five areas for this year. And is there -- is there any talk or what's the thought process you have around what you might see in the Wolfcamp B, in the Spraberry, and some of these areas that have been more heavily drilled vertically?","Tim Dove","Well, just to comment on that Charles, maybe Joey can comment after I do. We're not completing these wells in the same zones if the vertical wells are completed. And in fact, a lot of those wells were not deepen into the Wolfcamp back in the day. So, we have essentially pristine Wolfcamp in lot of the areas we're talking about. So, I think we're going to start there and we'll see some very good results. I did tell you though that we're going to be conservative in our forecasting, because we haven't drilled any wells there.","And accordingly, we are getting the effect of having to spend more capital on infrastructures we're not getting on a limp or over a skis and what those areas are looking to produce, but we're pretty excited about him because as I mentioned. Definitely there is a correlation between how well the vertical wells perform and then the subsequent horizontals. Joey, any further comment?","Joey Hall","We're just really commenting on that because of the additional facility's CapEx is required. So, we do have high expectations for these areas. Pioneer has one of the largest datasets in the Permian Basin with over 7,000 vertical wells. So, we have a good idea of what to expect, but you never really know until you drill the well, but our expectations are high.","Charles Meade","That's great color. Thank you, guys.","Tim Dove","Thanks Charles.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Good morning. Michael Hall with Heikkinen. Just I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about -- we haven't talked about Eagle Ford yet -- you guys are restarting that program. Maybe just some additional context as to how you see the Eagle Ford fitting in the portfolio longer-term, and what you would hope to achieve with the test this year.","If successful, does it set it up for a potential sale? And if so, what would be the first I guess use of capital there, first use of proceeds?","Tim Dove","Yes, Michael let me comment about the first of those points. First of all as you look back at the plan we prosecuted in Eagle Ford through many years at least for the last couple of years we're drilling 2014, 2015, we were heavily choking back the wells just with the idea that would improve their EURs and in doing so we match the fact that as we get a little bit too far down spaced, we are actually destroying value by having reduced EURs.","So, that gone honest that as we got in the analysis 2016 and that's why these next tests are so critical, because were in is as Tim mentioned get out to the point where these wells are more widely space we are going to put latest style facts on these wells that we ever have in Eagle Ford and others have successfully.","But again, more of to use Permian Version 3.0 style completion and therein lies the proof of the pudding will have to see what that means. If these wells perform as we suggested in our comments that means is thousand well inventory of these very high quality high return wells that changes the whole view of the asset and we can actually prove that. So were really evaluating this through the year and look at these well results, in the well results will dictate you were where we go with the Eagle Ford including the potential to just ramp up a drilling campaign. So, we\u2019ll be evaluating that as the year goes on.","Michael Hall","Okay, so premature to think about it as a potential asset divestiture.","Tim Dove","We are drilling wells, Michael right now.","Michael Hall","All right. And then I guess I also wanted to hit on the water side. It sounds like, obviously, with the buildout in the main line this year, it sounded like you were alluding to some additional spend in 2018. Can you help quantify kind of how you see water infrastructure spend over the, I don't know, three-year window, and then just kind of how water consumption looks over that time?","Tim Dove","Yeah. On the consumption front, I can tell you that today, every day we source 350,000 barrels a day of water roughly, that number is going up in our 10 year plan to 1 million barrels a day water. So over talking about this water business is tantamount to a linchpin to our success.","So, the spending this year's I mentioned has more to do with main line and Joey mentioned it as well mainline construction, frac ponds construction some substations and so on with a slight amount going into the Midland and to the Midland project that said as we look forward to 2018 that's when the predominance of the middle spending comes in probably 100 million or so be in 2018 attributable just to reap the refurbishing of their plant facilities.","And with additional amount capital going in there related to just again the same thing main lines and substations wishes been essentially identical amount in 2018 as we are in 2017 at that point we have essentially completed the system. You never really complete the system because you have frac ponds, you want to build closer to where activity is and so on but the predominance were spending is done in the 2018 timeframe.","Michael Hall","Helpful. Appreciate the color.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thank you, good morning everybody. Good morning, Tim.","Tim Dove","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate","So, I'm wondering if I could ask a follow-up on the Eagle Ford. Clearly, the potential for an improvement, as you just laid out, is one thing, but the growth potential of the Permian relative to the Eagle Ford obviously stands out. Are you looking more about moving Eagle Ford to kind of maintenance level of production with a view to potential disposal, or is it truly going to drive capital relative to the Permian?","Tim Dove","But I think that proofs in the pudding on that Doug. I think that if we can achieve the kind of returns that Tim mentioned, which would at a minimum compete in a lot of areas in the Permian on certain zones, it could actually have a longer life in terms of drilling. The main thing we want to do is prove up technically that we have these questions answered. That we have the puzzle effectively unlocked in terms of how to improve value there and we\u2019re going to keep all the other matters down in front of us as to how we might proceed.","I mean, is clear Permian is a behemoth but Eagle Ford has been a great asset for us and a great growing asset for us for many years and this is a chance to get it back in to that mode. So, we\u2019re simply executing the plan and then we will decide where that lead us in terms of next set of decisions.","Doug Leggate","I guess you called out the margins in that table you put in the slide deck. It kind of underlines the relative incremental cash margin you get from the Permian relative to Eagle Ford. That's really what was behind my question.","Tim Dove","Yeah and I think you are right about that I mean, Eagle Ford in our area as you know is roughly a third oil -- a third gas there and a third NGLs. So, it's already a bit behind the eight-ball economics wise as it relates to -- the last two categories. That said that we're expecting some improvement in ethane prices as the crackers continue to be built out in the Gulf Coast.","Are you seeing a substantial amount of improvements in ethane simply because of the burgeoning export market for both ethane and profane? Natural gas is a bit on the curve obviously if we can get a relatively higher gas price well into the upper 3s. The analysis changed materially because the amount of gas in these wells.","So, this is something used to be part of the analysis we'll have to look at what the outlook is for all three of these commodities that just simply not as much of a factor in Permian drilling where we drilled wells as I mentioned earlier 75% or 80%. The first production of the wells is oil with the balance being gas and NGLs. So, this is not as big of an issue in Permian but is an issue for Eagle Ford, we'd continue to watch that.","Doug Leggate","My follow-up, hopefully a quick one, is so you've obviously improved or raised the type curve in the Wolfcamp B, but relative to your prior commentary, the Wolfcamp A, I think you'd said it was running about 25% in the last call better than your 1 million barrel curve. You've now come out at 1.2 million and a similar kind of situation with the joint venture area.","I wonder if you could just give some color as to where you are on the learning curve in those two areas. And what I'm thinking specifically is the mix of lateral lengths that's behind those numbers and where you think ultimately -- if you still think you are on an improving path on those type curves as well. And I'll leave it there. Thanks Tim.","Tim Dove","The one thing that I would really stress on lower Spraberry shale and Wolfcamp B, delicate the mix of wells as we approach 800 wells, only about 9% of our wells are lower Spraberry shale and about less than 20% of Wolfcamp B. After that the most of those wells have only been drilled here recently. And then one good illustration the geology in the lower Spraberry shale is just different as is slightly different Wolfcamp B. And just looking at Wolfcamp B a curve you can see it just took a while for that separation to take place.","So, the reality is we're just really in the infancy. If I look at production days that we have with history on Wolfcamp B and total production days that we have with Wolfcamp B, it would just work. So as Frank has mentioned in the past and as I know as the work goes on here I know we just tend to be a little conservative until we get the data. But I'd just tell you the longer they produce the more encouraged we are, but it just going to take time for us to get where we can be more definitive about the higher type curve.","Joey Hall","And one thing that happens to be the case on Wolfcamp A is they tend to be flat for long because it takes a while to get the water off the system, where the Wolfcamp A is essentially little bit lower pressure because of his depth in the Wolfcamp B, so all these are factors.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. Maybe one just for me. What drove the 10-year guidance you introduced today? I know the pain was still drawing on the industries through your guide at this strip. Is there sufficient confidence in the long-term development plan?","Is there some acknowledgment of a future production plateau level and a realization for a longer-term, obviously, over a decade transition from a growth to a distribution company? Or any more meaning there as we think about that, the longer-term guide?","Tim Dove","Evan, that's a great question. I think that lot of our thinking about this topic was revolving in 2016 when we saw the effects of going from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 version wells and the types of returns we're doing with and then taking forward as to what type of plan we could execute going forward it would be efficient.","And we landed on the opportunity to look at this 15% growth rate and in doing so actually spend within cash full and\/or generate positive cash flow above capital in the plan period. That's a game changer and it has to do with the fact that we have essentially infinite supply wells to drill if you think it in a PV sense.","They are very high quality wells in the center of the basin. Not many people can say that and so it's just a simply a matter that our asset base can deliver this kind of result. We would never come out and talk about 10 years we can think it was eminently doable.","We get a lot of people who are focused on this now. We get a lot of work to do to prosecute that plan, but I've got a lot of confidence in it. It doesn\u2019t really have to do but going towards the disbursement model or as we called it or some related work. It has more to do with the fact that this is how we want to execute the process orientation of our company moving forward.","We can go faster, we can go slower, but this is what I am a ball towards a long-term goal and it has really more to do the assets than anything else.","Evan Calio","Is there a plateau level in, as you think of it today, a full field development, or is it just too early to assess where that might be?","Tim Dove","I think your long ways away from that. If you at the campaign that we are talking about over 10 years and in fact we take a look at some remodeling we've done. You would say that we\u2019re about, at a point when we build about 25% of our inventory of currently a minimum 20,000 wells after 10 years.","So, we can keep growing. The question in our cases is only a matter how much capital we want put to work and this is not a question of -- can you accomplishes the question is what do you want to spend on it and in doing so what you want to spend to make sure you continue to be efficient. Those are our main areas of focus.","Evan Calio","Okay. Thank you.","Tim Dove","Evan this is -- I just wanted to add one thing and it was touched on earlier but I think is important and that is that we heard last year or a year before I think industries are about in strengthening the returns not only the well returns but the corporate returns -- E&P companies reporting out and that\u2019s one of the things that sort of underlying this whole program Tim as on the slide about improving not only the well returns but the corporate returns. So, that\u2019s the fundamental thing that drive in this all program as well.","Ken Sheffield","And to add to that Frank, I believe that the industry is been castigated for some time regarding the content of destroying value with a way to destroy value is you heavily accelerate when prices are high and costs are high only be dealt the downturn and then you heavily decelerate at a time when costs are low, that's exactly the opposite thing you should be doing or trying to create value. That's why we are making price basically an exogenous variable and what we do going forward we are operating our process and price becomes a factor, but it's not the factor.","Evan Calio","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey","Good morning everyone. So, to the long-term target, could you talk about the risked and unrisked inventory assumptions that you are making in that? Thank you.","Tim Dove","We put out the 20,000 locations available to drill, that's already a risk number by zone. It has to do with issues pertaining to making sure we shave down the EURs to give us some conservatism we also eliminate a certain percentage of locations and we feel like would be undrillable because of their lateral lengths or because of other issues such as surface related issues. So, the 20,000 inventory is essentially already risked.","If you at our internal math on this, we can easily calculate 35,000 locations. Now that some of those will depend upon pricing of course, as you get into some of the other zones but we have essentially here of unlimited supply of high-quality wells and so you don\u2019t -- I don't anticipate significant degradation over the tenure plan.","Paul Sankey","Understood. Thank you. Could you just -- forgive me if you've talked about this, but what are the oil price assumptions, service cost inflation assumptions, that you're making in all this? Thanks.","Tim Dove","The base commodity deck is 55 and three through the plan period, essentially \u2013 ","Paul Sankey","Whether there be kind of basic inflation number, I guess?","Tim Dove","Well basic inflation you will see this year. We\u2019re still a $55 you shouldn\u2019t see much inflation about what we are seeing today. Because you know it\u2019s obviously the point where it's substantially lower than the peak cost in the 2010 through 2014 timeframe.","So, we\u2019re assuming as I said earlier just from hearing industry discourse about 10% to 15% this year which would affect us by 5% which were going to offset by efficiencies but that's to get you up to the 50 to 55Ks. I think you were 50 to 55Ks through the plan period, that margins today essentially where they are today.","Paul Sankey","Yes, that's impressive. And then again, further to what you just said, what efficiency assumptions would you make on that long-term view? Are you just kind of baking in current performance or are you actually assuming you get better and better over time?","Tim Dove","Yeah, we are making in zero performance enhancements, which doesn't make any sense, if you look at what we done on that it doesn't make sense to make those essential to have those in the bag but to give you an idea by the 10th year of the model that we run we would expect to be running let's just say 65 or 70 rigs will be our intentions about the time we get to the 10th year we would be running say 45 rigs, because those efficiencies nonetheless baked in.","Paul Sankey","Okay. Finally, for me, can you just remind us why others can't replicate what you're doing? Thanks a lot.","Tim Dove","Yeah, Paul, it simply a fact that we point to substantial inventory meaning essentially endless inventory of very high quality, high return wells in the Midland Basin where we don't have to add more acreage, we don't have to get in the land grab business and you just executing our plan.","Most people when I look at the next three to five years they have to put together plan to say how they're going to create the locations to make that happen. We have the locations, we have the people, we have the wherewithal and so is simple for us to say this is not going to execute that won\u2019t be simple to execute, because there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But I believe we have the capability of pulling it off.","Paul Sankey","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Freeman with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Tim Dove","Hi, John.","John Freeman","When we are looking at the current plan where you're going to operate six of the seven pressure pumping fleets this year, longer-term, with the plan, once you get beyond the seven, to utilize third-party or potentially consider expanding your fleet.","Tim Dove","Great questions I think as you know when we got into pressure pumping, it was at a time when prices are crazy and you couldn't get services on time back in the upturn. At that point in time we really never want to be a 100% vertically integrated in pressure pumping I think that still stands today. We always talk about being say two-thirds or 70% vertically integrated to protect ourselves from cost increases and basically make sure we can execute on our plan.","I see that going forward but that's an optionality for us that\u2019s a lever we can pull that we proven that we can operate these fleets very efficiently in fact we put our fleets up against any in the industry in terms of their competitiveness inefficiencies. But we still have to just evaluate where we want to put capital as we go forward that will be trade-offs, it sort of a buy versus rent deal when it comes to frac fleets.","So, we are get through this year. We\u2019ll make decisions then as we get through latter part of this year what we would want to add weather it would be internal equipment or outside parties as we get into the next year. We are that we are executing with -- we will be executing shortly with one outside pressure pumping fleet in Permian our work from in the Eagle Ford will also be done by outside parties.","John Freeman","Great. And then just my one follow-up along the same lines, when I'm thinking about the ten-year plan on the non-D&C component, is it best to think about it as it's roughly going to run around 10% of the total CapEx, or is it more likely the current kind of $300 million run rate is just sort of what you've generically assumed going forward?","Rich Dealy","We look at it John, where the $300 million is essentially constant in the model work that's enough to provide you what you need and there it's the start try because we have the sand plant is going to be expanded some point where you're ready told you about the water systems at some point when you are fully built out than what happens to you its only incremental spending. So even this year we have money going into the expansion at one of our gas plant facilities in Permian and a new plan coming on with target next year.","So incrementally we'll be adding more gas processing facilities through time but when it comes to water system once it build out its good, once the sand is built out its good. And then we\u2019re just about making sure as was discussed in earlier call that we have all the export in the pipeline space and so on out of the basin. So, that we are in good position to execute plan.","John Freeman","Thanks Tim. Well done.","Tim Dove","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to today\u2019s presenter for any additional or closing remarks.","Tim Dove","Thanks, everybody for participating in the call. We appreciate you being here. And we will obviously needless to say we are on the road in both Vail and elsewhere as the year progresses and be happy to cover more of this in more detail, really appreciative everybody\u2019s involvement and participation.

After that, we will open up the call for your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Thanks, Frank. Good morning.","We're on the highlights on Page #3. We had another great quarter in the fourth quarter of '11 with adjusted income $147 million or $1.19 per share as compared to a consensus of $1.03. This does exclude some mark-to-market derivative losses of $22 million and also some unusual items of $1.94, $236 million.","Fourth quarter production, we were at the high end of 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are moving South Africa into discontinued operations. That would put us at 137,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We have a process that's underway and should be completed by the first half of 2012. That will be the divestment of our only remaining international asset.","Again, production was up 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 9% versus third quarter. Also, 19% quarter-to-quarter on oil growth primarily related to growth in the Spraberry, Eagle Ford Shale and the Barnett Shale Combo. For the year, we averaged 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes our discontinued ops in South Africa. We're up 14% versus year end -- for the full year of 2010. If we exclude discontinued ops, we're up 16%.","What's more important, and Tim will talk more about it in detail, we drilled our second successful horizontal Wolfcamp Shale well, performing exactly like the first well. Both wells are above expectations. This will probably end up being one of the largest oil shale plays in the U.S. We are the largest acreage holder in that play with well over 400,000 acres.","We're continuing our successful deeper drilling to the Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian, with about half our wells going into these areas or more in 2012. Continuing to add additional frac capacity totaling 70,000 horsepower in both Spraberry and Eagle Ford in the fourth quarter. Again, delivered great drillbit finding cost, drillbit reserve placement, 313% reserve replacement, 148 million barrels of oil equivalent and a drillbit finding cost of $13.83 per barrel of oil equivalent. Also a big achievement: reaching investment grade by S&P and also moving our debt-to-book down to 26% at year-end 2011.","Going to Slide #4. We are increasing our annual production growth of 23% to 27% from '11 to '12 as compared to the 22%. It does exclude South Africa. The primary reason for the growth increase, again, is the horizontal Wolfcamp play and the ramp-up there.","We continue to high-grade our liquids-rich drilling to optimize returns in response to low gas prices. We'll talk more about it with the activity, but obviously focusing on higher capital efficiency in liquids-rich drilling in the Spraberry, horizontal Wolfcamp Shale and Eagle Ford Shale primarily.","We are reducing our rig count expectations. We're keeping it at 12 rigs during 2012. We're moving back our planned goal of 14 rigs in 2013 in the Eagle Ford, maintaining Barnett Shale at 2 rigs and we'll be moving to 4 rigs toward the end of the year, going into 2013.","Targeting 20% compounded annual growth rate, which is an increase from 18% previously, and also expect to achieve a 25% compounded annual operating cash flow growth rate for 2012 to '14. We'll be adding more frac capacity than we had planned during 2011 of 70,000 in the Spraberry for a total of 300,000 horsepower and that's primarily due to the ramp-up of the horizontal Wolfcamp play. With the recent runup several weeks ago of WTI, we've added some more oil derivative positions of the years 2012 to 2014. Primarily, the 3 ways that we have been doing in the past.","Slide #5, on reserve additions. Again, strong finding cost. We added 148 million barrels of oil equivalent from the drillbit at a finding cost of 3.83 (sic) [$13.83] per barrel of oil equivalent. Again, significant drilling campaigns in Spraberry, Eagle Ford and Barnett Shale Combo Play. An all-in finding cost of $17.51 per BOE.","Reserve mix, 99%-plus. Obviously, by the end of 2012, we'll be at 100% in the U.S.; 60% liquids, 40% gas; 58% proved developed, 42% PUD. Proved reserve production ratio of 22 years and a proved developed reserve production ratio of 13 years. And you can see a breakdown on the table, again with Spraberry more than -- or it\u2019s continuing to be the big driver; eagle Ford's picking up significantly; also improvements in both Barnett Shale and Alaska.","Going to Slide #6. As I have mentioned earlier, increasing our production growth target. As you can see we're picking up from up to 22% previously, going up to 23% to 27% for the year 2012 and going from 18% to 20% over the next 3 years. Also an important point, we're increasing our liquids from previously shown. We've moved our -- going out, we're already at 56% liquids fourth quarter, moving to 65% liquids in 2014 which was previously at 60%, again with the focus on liquids-rich shales.","Operating cash flow growth, going from about $1.5 billion at $100 oil and $3 gas, including our hedges, and we expect to receive $2.2 billion cash flow, on up to $3.3 billion. As you can see, we're already getting 80% of our revenue from liquids, and in 2014 we'll be at 90% revenue from liquids, achieving a 25% CAGR over that 3-year time frame.","Going into our capital spending for 2012 and cash flow on Slide #8. A capital program of $2.5 billion. It includes a little over $1.5 billion for Spraberry vertical. Even though we made comments about slowing down on the vertical program, we're actually increasing the number of wells. We drilled about 690 wells in '11, we're going up to 750 wells vertical in 2012.","The reason for the slowdown primarily is the ramp-up of the horizontal Wolfcamp play where we're going to spend $275 million in that play, that includes $25 million for seismic and coring. Even though the returns are very similar between the 2 programs, we get a lot more production per dollar invested in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play. And especially even more so, we're performing above expectations.","We're also spending $100 million for infrastructure in the both Spraberry and the horizontal Wolfcamp play, primarily expanding 2 plants. Those 2 plants will be a 320 million of capacity. We're building essentially 2 new plants: 1 in Midland county and 1 in Martin county to handle both the residue and the NGLs coming out of the rich gas from these 2 plays.","Eagle Ford, we expect to carry, to continue through the end of 2012. We'll spend about $130 million. Barnett Shale Combo, $215 million for 2 rigs. A little increase from Alaska. As we have mentioned, we are drilling 2 key wells: 1 in the Torok, a discovery we made about a year ago, with a large selective frac job; and then we'll be drilling an exploration well with somewhere between 100 and 200 million barrel potential in the same area to the Ivishak, 2 key wells for Alaska. Additional $120 million includes land capital for existing assets.","And as I mentioned earlier, we're increasing our vertical integration. We've been mentioning about $50 million for the year of 2011, and we'll be going up to about $100 million, both increasing our horsepower because of the horizontal Wolfcamp play and we're adding more pooling units in West Texas.","The capital program is funded from an operating cash flow of $2.2 billion and, again, with equity proceeds of $300 million for the $2.5 billion CapEx program.","And finally on Slide #9, investment highlights. With the eventual sale by mid 2012 of South Africa, we'll be at a U.S. asset base for the first time in about 14 years, obviously most of it focused on Texas with our liquids-rich shale plays. 2012 drilling program is focused on the Spraberry vertical play, the Wolfcamp Shale horizontal play, the Eagle Ford and the Barnett Shale Combo Play.","Again, forecasting 20% CAGR production growth and 25% CAGR through 2014. Again, seeing substantial improving returns by being vertically integrated, saving over $450-million-plus per year. That number should increase in 2012.","Again, great hedge positions in both oil and gas in 2012 and beyond. And again, a strong financial position with debt-to-book at 26% and achieving investment grade during the quarter.","Let me turn it over to Tim to talk more about operations.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. We did have a very strong operational quarter in the fourth quarter of 2011 across our entire asset base and that includes our assets in Raton and the Mid-Continent area. But for today's purposes, I'll be talking principally about our Texas-based growth assets, and I'm going to start with discussions regarding the horizontal Wolfcamp play.","Although it is early in the play, we're continuing to see encouraging signs. And specifically in this report, we're talking about a second horizontal successful well that was in the neighborhood of 1.5 miles away from our first well. The wells were completed and drilled and designed essentially to be identical and what we've seen, importantly, is almost identical results.","Now they only were drilled to 5,800-foot lateral lengths, that's considerably less than we'll be drilling as we go forward, and I'll talk more about that in a minute, and with only 30-stage completions. With that said, we're very confident that, with our use of microseismic, that we once again successfully landed the wells or successfully have the fracs in the entire 500-foot  -- 800-foot zone, so it's actually going exceptionally well in these 2 wells. And you can see that as you go to Slide 11 in which case we show the production from these wells in their early stages. And you can see they're almost identical, as I mentioned earlier.","What's really important about this production to date on the first well is that, after about 90 days, we've seen about 45,000 BOE of production in that well. That's about 7x what we would expect from a normal Spraberry vertical well over that same 90-day period. So that 7:1 ratio is important because, as we look ahead and go looking forward to the development planning, we're looking at about a 4:1 ratio in terms of the cost of a horizontal well compared to a vertical well. And so that gives us some confidence, looking forward, that we may in fact be showing evidence that we're getting capital efficiency in the horizontal wells.","If you take a look at the graphs of the 2 wells, first of all, I'll say these numbers that you see in terms of production are well above our expectations for these wells and well above the type curves we anticipated. You\u2019ll also note, as you look at the first well which is depicted in the red, that it has been relatively flat, a flat production profile. This well is still on natural flow. And so this is a very good sign for the ultimate productivity of these wells, especially considering they are under natural flow. Now, as with all shale plays, this kind of consistency and predictability are an important component of the value. And I think what we're seeing, as I mentioned, is empirical evidence that these horizontal wells may, in fact, lead to capital efficiencies as compared to our vertical program.","On the next slide, in fact, the next couple of slides, they deal with our plans moving forward in the play. As you can see on the map in the right, this play has immense aerial expanse and you can see the 2 wells we drilled in the Giddings area to the north and west, some 60 miles away from where the rest of the activity is taking place in the play.","It's clear we have over 400,000 acres that are prospective for the Upper and Middle Wolfcamp interval that has been the target of the first 2 wells. We're the largest acreage holder in the play. And it's also clear from the data we have that this horizontal play actually extends farther northward as well, in fact, perhaps as far north as the northern limits of Midland county.","One of the most important statistics regarding this particular play is it's probably one of the most prolific shale plays in North America when you measure it in oil in place. And it's consistent across substantially all of our acreage that we have somewhere between 50 million and 100 million barrels of oil in place per section, meaning the productivity from these wells should be outstanding.","As we look forward and I mentioned this earlier compared to the earlier wells, we'll be designing the wells with about 7,000-foot laterals, probably 35 stages in terms of the fracs. In the early days, we are penning in EUR of 350,000 to 500,000 BOE per well. Obviously, we have to see a lot more data before we're able to claim exactly what that number is. But so far, the first 2 wells are beating the type curve.","In the early stages of this year's campaign, we'll be drilling what we refer to as science wells. Those include cores and, in many cases, also microseismic and extensive log suites. And so we're looking at well costs therefore in the neighborhood of $8 million to $9 million probably for the first half of the year for several wells and dropping that down to more $6 million to $7 million as we get into more of a development campaign and out of the science program. Importantly, the returns look as good or better than our vertical wells, and this may owe to the fact that we think we're seeing some capital efficiency in the horizontal program.","If you go to Slide 13, then. Our near-term plan is to focus on these southern 200,000 acres that are depicted on the map. The objective here is to preserve leasehold. This is an area where vertical drilling economics have been challenged, and therefore, we have much drilling to be done to preserve the leasehold in the neighborhood of 80 to 90 wells between now and the end of 2013 to hold that acreage. Of that, we expect about 30 to 35 wells to be drilled this year. And toward that end, we have 3 rigs running today: 1 well is actually waiting on frac, which will be started up next week, and 2 other wells drilling. These are the 7,000-foot laterals I mentioned in Southern Upton and Reagan Counties, as shown on the map.","We have already, importantly, contracted up to 7 rigs that will be here by year end and we will be heading towards 10 rigs as we get into 2013. We also are acquiring about 260 square miles of 3-D seismic. This essentially is being done in order that we can avoid geohazards in our development plan.","So suffice it to say, we are getting a lot of confidence in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale. And I think it's clear it's going to be the fourth leg of our oil-based, liquids-based, high-return growth assets in the state of Texas.","But as you turn to 14, let's not forget we are continuing a massive vertical campaign in the Spraberry in 2012 and, in most every case, deepening the wells. And we've now proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the deepening of the vertical wells is still paying off very handsomely.","Slide 14 shows the results of last year's drilling campaigns, including in the Strawn where we completed about 246 of the wells out of the total of something like 700 wells in the Strawn, and the data is very definitive. We see about a 25% increase in production during the cumulative 12 months compared to the offset Lower Wolfcamp wells where the Strawn was not completed. And that gives us confidence in about a 30,000 BOE incremental EUR for those wells that have the Strawn. And we think that's 50% to 60% of the acreage.","In the Atoka and Mississippian, these are deeper targets. And actually from a geographical standpoint further to the north, we've completed 18 wells in the Atoka and believe that they are adding somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 to 70,000 BOE and will be prospective on 25% to 50% of our acreage. And then Mississippian, which is even deeper, we've completed 4 wells in that zone and believe we have potential incremental EURs of 15,000 to 40,000 BOE where it's prospective on about 20% of the acreage.","So you'll see a massive vertical campaign including the deepenings, as shown on Slide 15. Out of 750 wells, you can see to which interval these wells will be drilled. Shown on the left is actually the deepest interval that's going to be completed. So the way you read the table is that, in the Wolfcamp, about 50% of the wells will be drilled to the Wolfcamp -- the deepest zone will be the Wolfcamp, meaning we would not be deepening to the Strawn, and we show the blended well costs we've added and the IRRs on Slide 15.","About 20% of the wells will be TD-ed [ph] within the Strawn and another 20% in the Atoka and 10% in the Mississippian, realizing that, in many cases where we're completing in either the Atoka or the Mississippian, we also may be including a completion in the Strawn.","Overall, what this gives us is about a $1.7 million to $1.8 million average well cost if you do a blending of all those completions and a very attractive IRR nearing 50%. So it's clear that the vertical program, specifically with the deepening of the wells, will be a major contributor to the Spraberry growths.","So if you look to Slide 16, what does that mean in terms of growth? You can see we had really quite an outstanding fourth quarter, hit the top of the range, about 53,000 BOE. As Scott has already alluded to, we will be reducing the vertical rig count just through the year simply by letting go of existing rig contracts as they expire. That begins midyear and continues through the end of the year. At the same time and in parallel with that we\u2019ll be increasing the horizontal rig count, as I mentioned earlier, from some 3 rigs up to 7 rigs by year end. And as a result, that will allow us to drill the 750 vertical wells and 30 to 35 horizontal wells this year.","Importantly, as we look ahead, we're beginning to include in our modeling production impacts from Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian deepened wells. And additionally, we're starting to forecast in the impact of production from the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale wells from the south.","Now I'm going to turn to Slide 17 and that's discussing South Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale production. Our Eagle Ford Shale team had an excellent operational year in 2011 as well where they drilled 111 wells and put 92 of those on production. We're currently running 12 rigs in the field. Our objective, as Scott had already mentioned, is to keep 12 rigs running and drill a 125-well program. At one point in time, we had considered drilling 25% of the program as dry gas wells, but in response to what's happening with natural gas prices, we're delaying that increase to 14 rigs until next year. And that will then have us drilling only about 15% of the wells into dry gas areas, the objective being to control areas where we have substantial additional wells that can be drilled on a leasehold by just drilling the first initial well. So this is really more of a long-term value proposition and maintenance of optionality when it comes to future gas prices.","We have an increase of the number of wells we plan to actually pump white sand, up to about 50% of the wells. Earlier, we had said 30% to 40% of the wells, but we've seen good results so far from about 30 wells in which we used white sand last year and the performance looks similar to those offset wells where we were pumping ceramic. And so this is a substantial cost savings for us, and accordingly, we should see economics improve as a result of that.","We have 8 central gas processing facilities online today and have 3 more planned as well as some upgrades at 3 other facilities. Most of that will be done during the first half of the year.","We did see some excellent results from pad drilling. Of course, most of the drilling we're doing up and down this trend is to preserve leasehold, but we have been experimenting with some pad drilling and the results look really stellar. In our first zipper frac, a 3-well program on a pad, we actually got the completions done in 5.5 days. That's about what you would expect to do for one well if you look back at our track record. And so as we look forward and we begin the process as we're getting into more pad drilling later this year, into next year, into 2014, I think you'll see substantial savings and economic benefit from pad drilling.","Turning to Slide 18. The ramp-up in the Eagle Ford Shale continues in terms of production and average about 20,000 BOE and you can see the increases, going forward. And this is even the case when we\u2019ve maintained 12 rigs in 2012 and then pushed the ramp-up out one year where we go to 14 in 2013 and then 16 in 2014 and 19 in 2015. The ramp-up is still exactly the same but pushed out one year in the face of low natural gas prices.","Slide 19 is covering the Barnett Shale Combo Play. We are keeping our 2 rigs running there and delaying moving to 4 rigs until perhaps the end of this year into early next year. They also did a very good job in terms of operations this year. And I'll show you the production increase on the next slide, but they drilled 43 wells and put 42 on production. Importantly, looking forward, we're going to be increasing the lateral lengths to about 5,000 feet where we had been averaging 3,500 to 4,000 feet. And accordingly, we're also increasing the average EURs that we see from these lateral wells lengthening to about 460,000 BOE compared to our earlier type curve of 320,000. So I think there's a clear benefit and a correlation between the lateral lengths and the EURs of the wells.","We are impacted, needless to say, in this play by low gas prices and not wanting to overspend the combination of our cash flow from operations and the portion of the equity raised at the end of last year that was for the funding of a Wolfcamp horizontal. Our returns have been compromised somewhat by low gas prices, but these 2 rigs will continue to drill, basically preserving leasehold and looking for a potential increase into 2013.","On Slide 20 then is the production I mentioned. We see that Barnett Shale basically landed in the middle of its range, 6,000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter. You can see the asset continues to grow even though we're only maintaining 2 rigs in 2012. And the punch line is Barnett Shale Combo Play still is a significant quality growth asset for us.","So overall, I'd say, operationally, the company is hitting on all cylinders in our 4 Texas-based oil and liquids resource plays.","And with that, what I'll do is pass it over to Rich for a review of the fourth quarter financials and guidance for the first quarter.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 21.","As Scott mentioned, we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $111 million or $0.93 per diluted share for the quarter. It did include unrealized mark-to-market derivative losses of $22 million or $0.18 per diluted share and unusual items totaling $236 million or $1.94 for the quarter, principally noncash items related to reduced gas prices. Adjusted for these items, income would have been $147 million or $1.19 per diluted share, as you can see on the slide there.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, we show our guidance coming into the quarter that we gave out in November, relative to the middle column there that shows fourth quarter including South Africa but excluding unusual items.","So going down that list is briefly on the highlights. Production was at upper end of the guidance, as Scott mentioned. If you look at exploration and abandonments, it's at the higher end of the range principally related to seismic data that we acquired for our horizontal Wolfcamp play in Spraberry. And then G&A was at just above guidance related to performance-related compensation. The other items are basically in line with where we forecast coming into the quarter.","Turning to Slide 22, price realizations. You can see on the bars there that oil was up 5% for the quarter to $91.51; while NGLs and gas were both down for the quarter, with NGLs declining 6% to $45.70 really as a result of declining ethane prices during the quarter; and the natural gas prices were down 17% to $3.37 per Mcf. At the bottom of the slide here, you can see the impacts of derivatives and that's there for your information.","Turning to Slide 23. I think the punch line here is that, really, production costs, if you look at each of the quarters in 2011, they were virtually flat throughout the year, with fourth quarter being on top of where the third quarter came in. Probably, the one item of note there, if you look at third-party transportation costs, they were up in the fourth quarter mainly as the result of Eagle Ford ramp-up and production. We had higher trucking and treating costs there.","Turning to Slide 24. A great balance sheet at the end of the year. We had $537 million of cash on the balance sheet, a net debt of $2 billion. Our credit facility of $1.2 billion is completely unused so, as Scott mentioned, net debt-to-book capitalization of 26%. And if you think about the forecasted $2.2 billion of expected cash flow, we have very strong coverage metrics, as well.","I think also that, during the quarter, we moved up to investment grade rate by S&P, which, as you know, reflects our continuing to improve our balance sheet.","Turning to Slide 25, first quarter production guidance. 141,000 to 146,000 BOEs per day, up from where we ended the fourth quarter. And then, exploration and abandonment is higher than our normal range to $35 million to $60 million really because it includes 2 items. One, we got 2 Alaska exploration wells going down this winter and then we also are shooting some additional Wolfcamp, horizontal Wolfcamp seismic in the first quarter.","All of the other items are the same as what they've been in prior quarters, other than current income taxes that is down with moving South Africa to discontinued operations. Current income taxes represent state taxes that we'll pay during the first quarter.","So with that, we'll stop here and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Brian Corales with Howard Weil.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, what do you all think, I know it's very early, but on the Midland basin horizontals, what do you think the optimum length is? I know you're kind of increasing the laterals. Do you all have kind of a length in mind or a number of fracs in mind?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, Brian. As Tim said, we're moving up to about 7,000 feet, we'll probably try some a little bit longer. But one of the critical issues there\u2019s only a certain amount of acreage, especially on university lands, that you can get these long laterals. I think the challenge for most operators is going to be several smaller independents will not be able to get up that long. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of probably dealmaking in the play, but on university lands where we own a lot of our acreage to be the area to move out 7,000, maybe even 8,000 feet. So the Bakken has moved up significantly. So where you can move out longer laterals, we'll definitely try it.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then you all did mention in the Eagle Ford with going more to white sand, a little bit away from ceramics. One, is there a rule of thumb? I don't know if it's depth or pressure where you're going to use white sand primarily. And then two, if we fast forward 6, 9 months, how much of the pressure pumping or the horsepower is going to be internally owned?","Timothy L. Dove","Okay, well, first of all, I think it's clear that we feel like that the white sand is something that's going to be best used in areas that are a bit shallower and lower pressure as compared to the opposite. In other words, I think it's going to be a situation where it's north and west in the trend where we're dealing with a shallower horizon as well as less pressure. And so I think you'll see us, like, for example, as you get in DeWitt County, the Western DeWitt County area is definitely using white sand. As you get south and east, you get hotter, deeper and higher pressure and that becomes an issue. So you\u2019ll see us using ceramics potentially to the southeast and sand to the northwest, in a general sense. In terms of horsepower, our second PXD-operated frac fleet is just right now getting cranked up. And that will have us at a point very shortly where we'll be pumping 2\/3 of the wells with Pioneer equipment for the rest of the year.","Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And can I, just to kind of follow on that, I mean, assuming white sand and, we'll say, 2\/3 of the pressure pumping with internal, what does that do for PXD's well cost?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, as you know, we've been using a blended well cost of $7 million to $8 million, something like that, but that includes internally generated pumping services as well as a combination of ceramics and white sand. If you look at the savings on white sand, it's about $700,000 per well. We think we can pump the wells at least $1 million cheaper than a third party. And so that should give you a handle on kind of what we're coming out on the cases where we just use white sand and our own pumping services.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the Eagle Ford volumes, it sounded like you guys were at the lower end of your Q4 guidance, but it seems like the issues are transitory. If that's true, just correct me if I'm wrong on that, but what is the exit rate for 2011 Eagle Ford volumes?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, let\u2019s see. I can talk to you about what happened, Brian, real quick in the field. We had a couple of situations which, I believe, are in fact transitory. We had a situation on some of our oilier areas where we were having some paraffin-related issues at the CGPs, which have now been alleviated with chemical treatment, so that was inhibiting some production, and so we got that back to normal. Also, we had a couple of situations in our CGPs where we were dealing with some high-line pressures during peaking operations. And accordingly, we were having to review, in fact, we're in the process of reviewing adding central compression to alleviate that problem. And that's something that's under, that's we're doing as of right now, we're actually in the process of evaluating putting in central compression. So basically, as you said, we're in a situation where these are just transitory issues that we're just solving.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And do you have a exit rate for the Eagle Ford?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, it's bigger than 20,000, I promise you that.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, is it bigger than 25,000?","Scott D. Sheffield","We just don't give out exit rates, Brian, so...","Richard P. Dealy","Brian, it's about 20, like we talked last night.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Oh, I told you I would try, Frank, anyways, so.","Frank E. Hopkins","I know you would.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the Wolfcamp itself, I'm curious on how you guys defined your original expectations. You guys say that the results are better than what you thought going in and I just wanted to get a sense of how you derived those expectation in context to the overall play itself and how you might see some variability in the rock quality as you go to the north in particular?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, as you know, we have over about 900,000 acres in the entire Spraberry, Wolfcamp play. So we have access to over 7,000 logs and we probably got the most number of cores versus any other operator. We've been there for a long time so we probably have more data. We have some 3-D seismic data on the shelf, we're buying some more or shooting some more so our data source is probably 10x greater than anybody else. We have people focused on it. And we're in the center of the basin where the oil is mature. It's very brittle in the Wolfcamp play, as we have found out through the core analysis. So we have a pretty good feel on how big this play can go. So the reasons the Wolfcamp, as you get to the Spraberry theme formation, the gradient increases, and because of that, we're seeing much better performance, as Tim has mentioned. On the production characteristics, there\u2019s both wells are still flowing, but at some point in time, we'll put them on either jet pump or pumping units, but they're flowing a lot longer than we expected. Pressure is staying higher. That's because we had a pressure regime change going from the Spraberry\/Dean down to the Wolfcamp. So that's helped us also.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. So then, the 2 wells, are those the expectations, then, going forward?","Scott D. Sheffield","That's going to change. But we're over, we're drilling wells 80 miles, 70 miles apart in the play and we'll be drilling wells basically to the north, so we will have to develop. Probably, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up having 3 or 4 different type curves. In the Eagle Ford, I think we've mentioned before, we got about 15 different type curves in the Eagle Ford so we may have more -- as much in that, but we expect at least 3 or 4 different type curves.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last question. Tim, you mentioned a number of times about capital efficiency as you shift towards the horizontal program. Can you put that in context in terms of numbers? What is the breakeven cost that you're expecting for your average vertical well versus the horizontal program at this point?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I haven't computed the breakeven numbers. But I look at it in sort of a simplistic method of analysis similar to what I mentioned on the call, which is we think our development drilling run rate for a horizontal well at $6 million to $7 million, which has quite a bit of detail behind it, which represents something like 4x the capital of a vertical well is a good number. And the real question is then what is the productivity of the wells? We're simply, at this point, encouraged by the early production. I mean, when you have a 7x on production compared to the vertical well, you get pretty excited about that because it has the possibility that you are actually adding significant capital efficiency. The issue with this is we'll only know the real answer to your question as we have more time and more production history under our belt, so that we really know the answer to the question. What I'm saying right now simply is that it's encouraging, what we're seeing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Everyone, you commented for the second well that you, microseismic told you that all 800 feet of the interval was frac-ed into. Can you remind me of what you saw in the first well?","Timothy L. Dove","Identical, Gil.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk about, with this well, the second well, the constraints are like the first well was?","Timothy L. Dove","This well does not have any real significant constraints, and so from that standpoint, it differed a little bit. But right now, these wells are essentially, neither one has any constraints is what it amounts to.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Is that significant in any way? Is the fact that the first one was constrained, does that suggest that it's actually a better well, or you can't...","Timothy L. Dove","I think you really can't read too much into it because the calculation of an unconstrained flow rate is simply that, it's a calculation, it's an estimate. So I think what we need to look at is how well these wells are producing. Right now that they've got several weeks and months under their belts in terms of data, is going to be the real illustrative point.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you calculate, based on pressure drawdown, when you're going to put the first well and pump?","Timothy L. Dove","It looks like, right now, we're still producing the well flowing, as I said. I think it could be within the next few months we'll be putting on a pump is the current thinking.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And what kind of rate do you think you'll be getting when you put it on pump?","Timothy L. Dove","I don't know the answer to that question [indiscernible]. I presume it to be higher. I can't tell you the number, though.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, no, no. I mean, when -- does it drop off to 100 before you put it on pump? Or does it -- you do it at 300, or I mean, you can tell?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's got to be 50 or less, I mean, or down to 0, maybe, so flowing pressure.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, okay, all right. And for just a housekeeping question -- well, before I get to that. The 100 to 200 million barrel potential in it, it was that potential, it's not for that well, right? That's just the one well that is...","Scott D. Sheffield","That well is looking at a 100 to 200 million barrel prospect within the shale. It'll take more than one well to develop it, but if it's a discovery and still there's spill, it could be as high as 200 million-barrels-plus.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How many exploration wells do you think you need to delineate that opportunity? How many wells would you need to drill to\u2026","Scott D. Sheffield","It's one well will determine that, and the size.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then how many wells to develop it?","Scott D. Sheffield","We'll have to get back with you on that.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Then for Rich, maybe, a housekeeping question. The share count seemed like it hadn't changed but you had this equity issuance. Am I missing something?","Richard P. Dealy","Yes, the share count, as you can imagine, yields weighted average. So until we\u2019re done at the end of the quarter, there's very really little of the new shares weighted into the calculation.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Even for the quarter?","Richard P. Dealy","Well, for the quarter because you only had basic 15 days of it, yes, 15 or 90. And plus, since we had a loss, you don't get all the, you don't have a big dilution effect.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And so that's, is that part of it, that there's a certainly is some antidilutive nature of the, these logs?","Richard P. Dealy","That's correct.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you quantify that?","Richard P. Dealy","I don't have it here in front of me, Gil, but I can, we can get it for you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to clarify a comment here on the Wolfcamp. You talked about the wells performing above expectations. You guys had an EUR range in these horizontal wells of 350 to 500 MBOE. So above expectations, would that be sort of above the midpoint, so kind of above a 425 number, or is that kind of above the high end at the 500?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we're signaling it's above the midpoint basically.","Richard P. Dealy","Yes, that's right.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","In terms of South Africa, obviously you guys announced the decision to sell that today. I know, in the past, Pioneer has kind of said that they\u2019d likely kind of produce that out. Is there anything that sort of changed your all\u2019s mind here on that?","Scott D. Sheffield","No. We've had, but we basically have had some contacts, positive contacts and we're working through the process. That's what\u2019s changed.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. In terms of the Eagle Ford, did you guys see any changes in the EURs for your wells in your year-end '11 reserve report versus year-end '10?","Timothy L. Dove","Now, we've been adding reserves, as you know, as a result of the large drilling campaign and the EURs are hanging in there.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and so roughly similar EURs there?","Timothy L. Dove","That's right.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, obviously you've talked about bumping up your CapEx a little bit here in 2012 to add some midstream. I guess, as you grow the Spraberry here, is that something you think might have to recur in the next couple of years, we may have to add another few plants every year or so? Can you just kind of help us out with that?","Scott D. Sheffield","No. We and analysts were talking, and since we are partners on 2 of the big 3 plants in the Spraberry play, we actually got them to increase. They came to us with a $100 million capacity. We got them to double it to $200 million, but a lot of it has to do with this ramp-up in the horizontal Wolfcamp play. It looks like the EURs are running at about 1,000 in that play. But when you're making a lot more oil, you are going to add a lot of casing head gas. And so and for that reason, and then we have another partner up in Martin county. We got them to increase that significantly also in another plant that we own in Martin county that's coming online here in the next few months because of the success in the deep vertical play by going to the Atoka and Strawn and Mississippian. And so this should, adding 200 million a day in Midland county and adding another 120 million a day in the new plant up in Martin county, it should give us plenty of capacity for the next several years.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, are these facilities that you guys are partners on, and you own like 1\/2 of these roughly, is that right, hence the CapEx?","Scott D. Sheffield","27% on 2 of the plants and about 30% on the other plants, so roughly around 30% in all 3 plants.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Hall with Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just quickly, I guess, in the Eagle Ford, it makes a lot of sense obviously to defer the dry gas activity. I'm a little curious as to why not kind of, I guess, reallocate that within the Eagle Ford to more liquids-rich opportunities. And are there kind of just logistical constraints to that or midstream or what's the thinking around that? And then also, is there any potential acreage loss associated with that reduced dry gas activity?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the second part of your question, I think Tim did mention that there is a few thousand acres, not much, that we are dropping. I don't expect anybody to pick it up so we always have the opportunity at some point in time to go back and pick it up as acreage costs come down. On the first part of the question, the primary driver. We did not increase Barnett and also Eagle Ford even though the economics are great is that we just didn't want to increase our CapEx. We have the bank facility to be able to do it but we just don't want to get into a big overspending mode. So to me, we're already growing 23% to 27% and which we just don't think we'll even get paid for if we grow anymore, much more than that, too. So it's a combination of capital efficiency and those bigger reasons.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. So it's just basically kind of stay within cash flow and not get too far ahead of yourself.","Scott D. Sheffield","Exactly.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess in the Wolfcamp, a couple of quick questions. When would you expect to test that acreage out near Arian [ph]? I mean, like, right on the border of Reagan in the Arians [ph]?","Scott D. Sheffield","We're going to be testing essentially our entire 200,000 acres by the end of '12. It\u2019s only an hour down south. So we\u2019ll eventually move out to the southeast at some point in time.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in Slide 11, in the footnotes there you provided, a couple of different NGL yields. I'm just curious, sorry if I'm not reading it correctly, but which one should I be thinking about as the more likely case? Or should it be somewhere in between them? Or how should we think about that?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think the first one, the 215 barrels per million and 42% shrink is the one that's probably the more generic answer.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, I guess, are you all targeting any other or still thinking about targeting any other horizontal intervals? Or are we kind of hands full with the Wolfcamp at this point and...","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. We have talked about in the past, these are on this call or individual meetings, about there is some activity by other operators in the horizontal Atoka. So we expect at some point in time the team is working up potential locations for that, and we also have a team looking at other shale plays in the area. So we think, with the Spraberry in the Midland basin at 20% of the U.S. oil reserves, that there\u2019s huge potential in other shale plays in the basin.","Timothy L. Dove","One addition to that is we are looking at the potential of actually go in one to the existing Spraberry pay zones called the Jo Mill, which we think also could be an area where horizontal drilling could enhance productivity. So that is something we'll probably do some, a couple of wells in this year. It's still under planning.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. I guess, actually, one last one for me. I think you said 750 wells in the vertical program. Is that a gross number or net?","Timothy L. Dove","That's gross numbers. I mean, net and gross are essentially the same for our Spraberry vertical drilling.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, in the Wolfcamp, you'd talked about it as potentially being your biggest oil play in North America. Where do you ultimately see rig count going there not just for yourselves but maybe industrywide? And then given you guys have your strategy of vertical integration, will you be looking at picking up higher-horsepower rigs to do that kind of drilling over time? Can you just kind of give us a little more color around that?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. It definitely has huge potential. I think the things that we're going to -- the main thing that's going to hold it back is the current land position. Most of it's held by, except by ourselves, or just a very few small, large operators. It's not -- it\u2019s totally different to Eagle Ford where people can come in and buy a lot of acreage. You cannot buy a lot of acreage in this play. And so it's going to take a massive effort to be able to put together small independent operators. A lot of people just have, they may have a Spraberry well on a 40-acre or 80-acre tract. The problem is you got to put together 1.5 sections or maybe 2 sections before you can even drill an economical horizontal Wolfcamp play. And that's going to be hard for a lot of people. So this play for that reason will probably go much slower than the Eagle Ford but it's got the potential to ramp up eventually to easily 100 rigs over the next 3 to 5 years and maybe even 200 rigs, but it's going to be a much, much slower pace versus the Eagle Ford play simply because of the current land position. And most of our rigs that people have to pick up are 1,500-horsepower, there's very few of those out in the Permian basin so these either have to be new builds or come from plays like the Haynesville. So we got to see a continued significant drop in the dry gas rig count in these plays and that will allow the Wolfcamp play or the Wolfcamp play over in the Delaware Basin also to pick up a lot of these 1,500 horsepower. So there is a shortage of 1,500 horsepowers for that reason and so another reason it's not going to ramp up as fast as the Eagle Ford.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Does that mean you guys are going to pursue potentially picking up some 1,500-horsepower rigs on your VI strategy? Or are you going to be looking to contract at this point?","Scott D. Sheffield","The ones that Tim mentioned already going up to 10 rigs, we're contracting to going up to 7, 8. By the end of the year, this year, going to 10, we'll be contracting. Most of them have already been contracted.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, you've done 34 rigs on downspacing in the Permian and waterflood results continue to get better on the margin. When do you guys kind of call victory on moving from 40-acre to 20-acre spacing? And when do you start prosecuting maybe a more aggressive waterflood?","Timothy L. Dove","I think the fact is we're continuing to drill 20-acre space wells this year and next year and the results look very, very good. And I think we've proven that this technology where we're deepening 20-acre wells and creating production, which is essentially equal to offset 140,000 BOE locations that otherwise were not deepened, is something that's going to work, going into the future. We'll be continuing to drill some 20-acre wells this year. I think the objective still is we've got several thousand 40-acre wells to drill so we may as well focus on those first. I think the fact is we've proven that 20-acre locations are going to be economic. On the waterflood, we're still continuing to see very good results and I'm starting to see additional response in other wells that had not yet responded. And so I think that's gone exceptionally well. We have a team of people that are working on about a 20,000- to 25,000-acre flood that we may be contemplating starting up here at the end of the year, a little later in 2012. But suffice it to say, I think we can call it a success. And right now, we're just assessing which next direction we're going to go. I think it would be later this year before we pull the trigger on that.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then in the Spraberry where you're looking at co-mingling various zones, can you talk a little bit about how these overlap? You've given us prospectivity for each area, but can you talk about how much of them overlap just so we can kind of think through how we'd model out field development on a longer-term basis?","Timothy L. Dove","I think, if you look at the slide that I was talking about, Dave, Slide 15, the important point about this slide in terms of overlap is you, typically, it's very seldom that you see a situation where you have both Atoka and Mississippian, just the way the aerial extent is. So into the extent that we're drilling a Strawn well, this would be more areas to the central and the southern part of the acreage. As you go north, you encounter Atoka and Mississippian, in a lot of cases, Strawn as well. And so what you have to realize is you can't just sum Strawn, Atoka and Mississippian. But in many cases, you're going to have the ability to complete in both the Strawn and the Atoka or in the Strawn and the Mississippian.","Operator","We'll go next to Amir Arif with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Guys, just a few quick questions. First, in the Wolfcamp Shale, can you tell us what the liquids cut is for the Wolfcamp Shale wells versus your typical vertical wells?","Scott D. Sheffield","They're both about 90-10, so 90% liquids, 10% gas. The Wolfcamp may be a tad higher than the vertical well. And it's got also higher Btu content so far on the first 2 wells, so moving toward 1,500 Btus versus 1,400 on a vertical well.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just give us some color of how you see the geology or the expectations as you move further southeast from where you did your first 2 wells towards Reagan County and [indiscernible]?","Scott D. Sheffield","Well, I mean, it's obvious because we have 60, 70 wells that have already been drilled by other operators. So we have that data and a lot of that data has to be filed with university lands. And we already have access to that data so that's why we're highly encouraged even though we have logs in the area. But the production results from both El Paso and also EOG are very good results.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But do you expect them to get better than your original drilling area or...","Scott D. Sheffield","I think in the -- we've seen some curves overlying our curves. The wells are coming in about the same. But I think, because we're deeper, that it looks like that we're already -- you have to look at the same wells with the same lateral to get apples and apples. It looks like our Giddings wells, based on their lateral lengths and the depth that they\u2019re in, are doing better than these other operators. The reason is, is that we're a little bit higher depth so we get a little bit better pressure regime. But as we move toward them, we should have similar expectations.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, sounds good. And then just a question on the vertical side. As you -- I mean, you\u2019ve been co-mingling all the way down, but as you go to some of these deeper zones in the Atoka or Mississippian, are you still able to co-mingle all the zones? Or do you have to sort of add the zones one at a time in terms of the shallower zones?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. We are allowed to co-mingle all the way down not including the Atoka so we can co-mingle the Strawn. And we are going into commission in February and March for a new set of field rules to allow us to co-mingle all the way down to the Atoka. And we're also coming up with a set of field rules for the horizontal Wolfcamp play and those have been filed. Hearings are in February and March.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick question on the Eagle Ford, just in terms of the dry gas acreage exploration. Is that going to be a -- is that a bigger issue in '13 or was '12 a big issue? I'm just trying to figure out what percentage of your drilling CapEx in '13, based on what you have so far, is going to be dry gas.","Timothy L. Dove","Of course, we haven't made decisions on 2013 yet but we will face more expiries of leasehold if we were to decide not to drill a significant number of dry gas wells. Remember, I mentioned earlier in 2012, we were talking about drilling 25% of the wells at a dry gas zone, other than from the fact we've had this gas market we've been facing. So now we're down to about 15% of the wells. We would have to drill a higher percentage next year to preserve leaseholds, so to the extent we do not drill more than 15% this year, we will not have significant loss of acreage. We could have higher acreage amounts lost next year if we were to do the same.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that you're not really pushing that '12 drilling over to '13 right now. Are you letting a little bit of that expire to '13...","Timothy L. Dove","It's very insignificant. We're also working on trying to renew some of these leases with cash, which we think is the better way to go than drilling wells on the leaseholds, and to the extent we can do that, we will. But that would leave us having a relatively low amount of acreage that we'd have to expire, less than 10,000 acres.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions on the gas percentage in the production mix, one is just following up on the last question there. If you look at the first Giddings well in the Wolfcamp, how, if at all, has that percent of gas in the mix has changed especially in recent days? And do you expect any change over time relative to the 30-day rate you've reported from the first 2 wells?","Scott D. Sheffield","The gas-oil ratio on both wells are about 1,000. On our first well, we did not have the test results back on the composition of the gas so we used roughly a Spraberry vertical well in the initial NGL calculations, so it turned out we were low. So the first well and the second well are the same. The Btu content is moving toward 1,450 to 1,500 Btus in both wells versus 1,350 to 1,400 in a typical Spraberry well. So we gave out a vertical well composition with our first horizontal well. But now, with the composition of both wells taken, they're both up to 1,450 to 1,500 Btus.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And should we expect a greater decline in the liquids relative to the gas? In other words, should over time as the well that goes through its normal life, it should become a little bit more gassier or do you think that, that ratio holds?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, when you move down to the southeast, you will see an EOG approach. They're announcing higher gas-oil ratio wells. It just happens to be, as you move down toward that area, it's just the vertical wells are gassier. And so you are going to get more gassy in those areas, but I don't expect it, up in this Giddings area, to change.","Timothy L. Dove","I'd comment, Brian, just simply to say that it's too early to know. But if you look at vertical Spraberry history, which [indiscernible] many more zones contributing than just the Wolfcamp, you do tend to see slight increases of the GOR through time on the production of the well. We don't know whether that applies here or not, though, until we see more data.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then in the Eagle Ford, since it looks like you're -- it's essentially entirely delaying, the gassy zone, the dry gas side, how should we think about what your production mix would look like in terms of what percent would come from that, from dry gas in the context of your overall guidance in, say, 2013 versus where you are right now?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, if you look at our current production there, I don't have the exact number but I know that, overall, we're looking at about 40% gas in the production mix. That's drilling the liquids-rich wells. And so I think, when you then mix in about 15% natural gas drilling, dry natural gas drilling, that could go up slightly but not in a significant amount.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Morrison, Global Hunter.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think probably everything has been asked and answered by now, but the one question I had regarding kind of expectations for the horizontal Wolfcamp performance that are baked into your outlook. I know that's going to be a moving target, but what's your, when we're thinking about your projections and guidance, what kind of rate assumptions do you have baked into your horizontal Wolfcamp well?","Timothy L. Dove","Dan, again, it depends on how many wells banners [ph] are actually put on production this year. But our average we're out with now is about 2,000 BOE per day average for the year, realizing that, because we have 3 rigs running now and we will have 7 by the end of the year, it's a significantly back-weighted curve. So I think the way to think about it is we're just ramping up from with these first 2 wells having been drilled, as we add then 30 to 35 wells in terms of drilling, how many would be on production by the end of the year? I think the main message here is the bigger impact is on 2013 than it is on 2012.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right, and but when we think about individual well, kind of what's your, you alluded to a type curve or your kind of standard well that these were meeting, what is your sort of your planning well...","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think it's a little bit harder to answer the question. That's why we're trying to be not very specific, Dan, because we've shown you the exact production for 2 wells, that's the limit of the data we have other than looking at offset operators' data, but I think you're going to see the natural declines on these wells. But what's interesting about the wells we drill, it's been relatively flat over the last few weeks of the production. So maybe they overperform, but we kind of have to beg off on details on that because we really need to have the data before we can give you the exact answer.","Daniel J. Morrison - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Or you'd just make things up. One other question about that play: How do you all see it working out to the edges of the basin as you come to the shelf margins, based on your look at geology so far?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I -- if Jay was here, he can answer the question, if I botch it. But the point I would make is, because I talked to the geologists about this, in the sweet spot, which is a lot of the areas we're drilling now, you have 800-foot section in this Middle and Upper Wolfcamp. And, but the Wolfcamp is so significant, so ubiquitous that, actually, as you go towards this, the edges of our field areas, you have a reduction of that thickness but it's not significant because it\u2019s only like 700 feet. So really, you're just talking about areas or sweet spots which are associated with thicker sections, being that 800-foot section, and that correlates well to oil in play. So I think it's the fact that you're going to see this play expand from an aerial standpoint as we go forward. But right now, we're focused more on this central area where we know we have upwards of 100 million barrels of oil in place per section.","Operator","We'll go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just a quick one. With the Wolfcamp, you said in the release you were running microseismic on the horizontal wells. Do you plan to do that in every well or just until you get a good sense of what the fracture pattern should be in terms of the intervals? And how much does the microseismic cost?","Timothy L. Dove","The answer to your first question is that we'll be doing sporadic microseismic as we're drilling in various areas. If you refer back to the map that's on Slide 13, you'll see there's actually 3 specific areas we're going to be drilling. And in those areas, we want to make sure we have good microseismic data in terms of the specific areas we're going to be drilling. And once you have good data to understand the frac propagation with some data points, I think we're good to go in those areas. In terms of the cost, it's about $400,000 to $500,000 per well.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Tullis with Capital One Southcoast.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Tim, I noticed that the gas component of the Barnett Combo wells dropped, I guess, from 75% previously to about 60% now. I know you're doing the longer laterals, but what's the key driver there?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, our data shows basically they\u2019re the same from looking back through history so I'm not sure where you're getting that data point.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","I was just looking at more of the prior releases, but that's fine. I could check with Frank later on that.","Timothy L. Dove","I think, for some time, we've had 42% gas in the mix and 58% liquids. And I think that's what the slides continue to show.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","And looking forward, cash flow versus CapEx beyond 2012, what are you expecting, using $100 oil, $4 gas, what are you expecting CapEx-wise to generate the growth that you're projecting out now for 2013, 2014?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I think the only, the 2 increases going into 2013 will be in the Eagle Ford going up to 14 rigs and also our carry will be going away in 2012. So in '13, the rig count increasing there and the carry going away will be the big increase in our CapEx. But the cash flow is expecting, it looks like, about $2.8 billion. So we'll be as close to cash flow as we can. Obviously, there will be a ramp, a continued ramp-up, adding 3 more rigs going into the horizontal Wolfcamp play. That'll be a little increase. We'll end up being very, very close to our cash flow in a $100, $4 scenario.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then 2014, you could be free cash flow positive?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, going into '14 and '15, more free cash flow positive.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have today for our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call now back to Scott Sheffield for closing remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again, thanks for being patient and listening to us during the quarter. Really, another great quarter. We're looking forward to seeing everybody on the road and some of the conferences that are coming up. Again, thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins","Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly go through the agenda for today's call. Scott will be up first. He's going to provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2013, another solid quarter for Pioneer. He'll then review our capital program for 2013 and our production growth outlook for the 2013 through 2015 period. This will be followed by some perspective on how big the horizontal Spraberry\/Wolfcamp shale play can become for both industry and Pioneer over the next several years.","After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim's going to discuss our horizontal drilling programs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, both in the southern Wolfcamp joint interest area and across Pioneer's extensive northern Wolfcamp\/Spraberry acreage position. He'll then update you on our Spraberry Vertical, Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale Combo and Alaska operations. Rich will then cover the first quarter financials in more detail and provide guidance for the second quarter. And after that, we're going to open up the call for your questions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. On Slide #3, Pioneer had another great quarter with adjusted income in first quarter of $136 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Our first quarter production, 171,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was above our guidance range of 165,000 to 170,000. That's up 6,000 barrels a day or 4% from the last quarter. That's primarily being driven by our Spraberry Vertical program, that's taking wells all the way down to the Atoka and the Mississippian in addition to the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale and Eagle Ford Shale drilling programs.","We're continuing to have great results from our southern Wolfcamp joint interest area. We did place 9 new Wolfcamp B wells on production with an average peak 24-hour IP rate of over 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil content was 82% oil. We did pump slickwater fracs on 5 wells through April, saving up to $1 million per well as compared to hybrid fracs, with results very encouraging either as good or better than the gelled fracs. We are nearing completion. We expect early June, waiting on the final regulatory body in China for the Sinochem joint interest transaction to close.","A quick update on our northern horizontal drilling program, which has been underway. We did recently fracture our Martin County well, and that well will be put on flowback in the next couple of weeks. We're adding 4 additional rigs to that rig during the second quarter. We did pick up a fifth rig, and that's going to be focused on the Hutt area where our well came on over -- about 1,700 barrels a day. So we'll have that fifth rig essentially focused on development drilling in the Hutt area. So we'll have a total of 5 rigs running by the end of the second quarter through the remainder of the year, going on up to 8 rigs going into 2014. Two of those rigs will be focused on Jo Mill and Spraberry Shales, which they'll be spudding soon.","Going to Slide #4. Again, we're continuing to see significant incremental production from our deeper vertical drilling in the Spraberry, with our 15 rigs primarily taking wells down to the Strawn and through the Atoka and the Mississippian. Eagle Ford continued to overperform with 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing a 7% growth from the fourth quarter. We had a very successful winter drilling program in Alaska. We fractured our 4 horizontal wells, 3 in the Nuiqsut and 1 in the Torok. Two of those wells have recently come on with peak gross production rates to date, they're still climbing, of 3,500 barrels a day and 3,000 barrels of oil per day. In addition, our appraisal well, definitely, in looking at the results of that well, allowed us to increase the original 50 million barrel discovery onshore to somewhere between 75 million and 100 million barrels. And again, we added -- with the run-up in gas prices, we added gas derivatives from '13 through 2016.","Going to our CapEx spending on Slide #5 and cash flow. Nothing has changed here. Important point, with adding the fifth rig, we are not changing our CapEx for the year. We had a -- we had built in a -- we had not built in a delay. The additional rigs were supposed to start up a little bit earlier in the northern appraisal program than they actually did. So it allowed us to pick up the fifth rig and start the drilling on the Hutt area without increasing CapEx. Also, we had -- our first quarter was front-end loaded with -- there's probably over $100 million in the first quarter with Alaska, drilling being primarily front-end loaded. And, secondly, the -- our transaction with Sinochem, we're picking up 100% of the costs even though it will be reimbursed at closing, 40% of the capital costs, but it's not credit to costs incurred. So we're obviously on track for the rest of the year, drilling capital of $2.75 billion, capital program of about $3 billion, funded with operating cash flow, cash on hand and the joint interest cash proceeds expected in early June.","Going to Slide #6. Again, with our quarter announcement of 171,000 and above, our guidance, we're still on track to deliver 175,000 to 181,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our liquids is moving up a little bit faster. We're up to 63% liquids, first quarter. Obviously, we're excited about that. The low end of this range assumes $85 oil, flat; $3.25 gas. The higher end of the 18% CAGR is more towards a $100 oil and $4.25 gas. Again, to remind people, we are not modeling in this growth rate the Hutt type performance, which is closer to a 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. We're modeling essentially 500,000 barrel ultimate reserves in this growth model.","Slide #8. Just a few key slides to show you how big this Wolfcamp\/Spraberry Shale play is. On Slide #7, this is a map we came out with about 3 to 4 weeks ago that -- this is strictly the Wolfcamp B. It's probably going to be your biggest driver and your biggest resource potential. We've come up with 22 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The key point here is our geoscientist. Based on 70,000 logs, based on 1,400 square miles of 3D, 4,000 feet of core. And in addition, we have tested selectively the Wolfcamp zones over the last several years from vertical fracs. And what's interesting from the -- where EOG in approach in the very southeastern part of the map, we draw a line up to our Giddings, then up to our Hutt well in Midland County, then all the way over to a third-party well, you're looking at about 100 miles. So we only got about 50 miles to go to prove at this play to the north. So 2\/3 of this play has already been proved up. We're assigning 22 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource potential. That's on a 140-acre spacing. We're already starting to move toward 70-acre spacing in our southern JV area. So you see, just the Wolfcamp B will probably end up being the biggest discovery in North America.","Going to the next slide on Slide #8. We have assigned reserves and risked it for the Wolfcamp D or the Cline, the Jo Mill and the Wolfcamp A. Again, only a 140-acre spacing. Almost all your shale plays discovery to-date are going either down to 70-acre spacing or even as low as 35- to 40-acre spacing. So again, tremendous potential in all these various zones, which will all be tested over the next 2 years.","Slide #9. Just to rank it in regard to where it sits with other U.S. oil fields. Before the shale era, Prudhoe Bay, was your largest discovery at about 13 billion barrels recoverable. Obviously, the Bakken is around 12 to 13 billion barrels. Eagle Ford is around 26 billion barrels. The Delaware Basin, over time, will come up significantly, as people put together their own maps. But the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp in the Midland Basin, obviously, is the big driver. And there's probably a lot of upside from here, obviously, with -- we are not adding the 2 lower and middle Spraberry shales, which we'll be testing. And again, this is on a 140-acre spacing.","When you look at Slide #10, what's the potential this could do for the U.S., you can see that, over the next 20 years from 2013, we're starting at a 0 point even though there is significant production already from this field of about 450,000 barrels of oil per day. There's 264 rigs drilling in this area already, both vertical and horizontal drilling is at -- and it's going to end up growing up to about 2.5 million barrels a day equivalent, with Pioneer's share being about 30% of that and getting up to 750,000 barrels of oil per day equivalent. It's made up of about 70% to 75% oil. Even though most of our wells are coming on about 80% oil, over time, over the 30-year life, 40-year life of these wells, they'll end up producing about 70% to 75% oil. And this has taken the rig count up to about 170 rigs, with Pioneer contributing about 50 of those rigs -- of the 170 rigs.","Let me let Tim talk to you about the growth in our assets.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. As his last couple of slides show, we have some very fortuitous [ph] goals for Pioneer in the Permian Basin for the next few years. And reaching those goals, of course, will depend upon execution. And you can see in the next several slides that I go through that we've made an excellent start in terms of doing just that.","First, I'm going to touch on, on Slide 11, the recent well results in the southern Wolfcamp joint interest area. You can see, in the blue boxes, 24-hour IP rates. On average, those were about 911 BOE per day, 82% oil. The average lateral length in those was about 7,100 feet, with the exception of that well you see at the very top, the University 10-1 #4H, which was just under 10,000 feet. But suffice it to say, with these kind of consistent results, they certainly reinforce our view that the southern acreage will deliver at or above the 575,000 BOE type curve that we've been establishing for this area in the south.","Now on Slide 12, turning to drilling activity in the south. We currently are running 7 rigs. We continue to focus on a expansion of the rig count up to 13. That will take our well count from about 86 wells this year to doubling that roughly 165 wells in 2015. So we've got a very significant acceleration built into the plan.","2013, of course, is the first year in which we're working on delineating acreage. We're testing several different intervals. We have the well cost estimate now ranging from $7.5 million to $8 million. Now that's based on 8,300-foot lateral, which is the average we anticipate for this year. That, however, excludes the benefits of pumping slickwater, which I'll talk about in just a minute.","Also, an important component of this campaign is to drill more 10,000-foot roughly laterals. We plan to drill over 20 of them this year. And our early data suggest that a 20% increase in costs that comes from the extension of the laterals is actually incrementing EURs perhaps up to 60%. So we really see a dramatic increase in efficiencies coming out of extending laterals. So we'll do that wherever we can, wherever the leasehold allows us to do it. Also, we're going to be seeing efficiencies coming out of the fact we're increasing our use of pad drilling, about 70% pad drilling in 2013. Scott's already alluded to our downspacing opportunities. Right now, we're testing 100-acre spacing. But as he mentioned, it's very possible we will go lower in the fullness of time to perhaps even down to 40-acre spacing or so.","Now to the slickwater fracs, we pumped 5. This can save $1 million dollars a well if you count all-in costs, including reduction of resin-coated sand requirements and so on compared to gel hybrid frac that we -- have been the basis of our earlier drilling. The 2014 campaign in the south will be more of the same, I would say, development drilling, increasing production even with a higher percentage of pad drilling. So in summary, we're certainly hitting our stride in the southern drilling campaign and expect to continue to do so.","On Slide 13, moving to the northern acreage. We'll be drilling 30 to 40 wells in the north, split between various Wolfcamp zones as shown on the slide and various Spraberry Shale and the Jo Mill zones, shown on the right-hand side of the slide. In essence, what we're doing in this case is delineating these various prospective intervals with the idea of proving up acreage. In various of these cases, we have over 600,000 acres per zone. So it adds up pretty quickly in terms of the prospectivity. As Scott has already mentioned, we're moving from 1 rig in the first quarter in the north to 5 here by the end of the second quarter. I'll give you a little more granularity on that on the next slide. The well costs here in the north, we anticipate to be slightly higher, $7.5 million to $8.5 million, for a 7,000-foot lateral. Again, it's under the basis that if you go -- as you go to the north, you're also doing deeper drilling and the deeper drilling has additional costs. Those numbers, however, do not include any benefit what would come out in pumping slickwater.","Now to Slide 14 and focusing on the second quarter drilling in the north. We'll be following up the DL Hutt well with further drilling in that area. And particularly, what we're doing is bringing on the second well that was drilled alongside that first Wolfcamp B well, bringing it on production here shortly. You may recall, we wanted to make sure we established a good, long-term production test for the B interval well before having to shut it in because we do have to shut it in, as we do the A completion in the offset well. And so, accordingly, we'll be very surely up there in the Wolfcamp A well doing a fracture stimulation and putting it on production. At that time, we will have to shut in the DL Hutt C #1H.","As it relates to the Martin County drilling, Scott already alluded to the fact that we have drilled and now completed the Martin County well. We're just drilling out the plugs, as we speak, and should be on production, as he said, next week or the week after. So we'll have some imminent production data on that.","We are adding 4 horizontal rigs. As he said, 3 were planned in our original planning. We've decided to add 1 additional rig to focus on developing the Hutt lease, where we made such an outstanding well, the best well in the play so far.","Capital will be essentially flat, from the standpoint of drilling, $2.75 billion from our original plan. We can absorb the incremental rig, as he mentioned, mostly because some of the additional rigs were coming in a little later than anticipated and the 5-rig program will consist of 3 rigs focused on Wolfcamp zones and 2 on the Jo Mill and Spraberry zones. We will be drilling most of these wells on 2-well pads to gain efficiencies, and the wells will only be completed after the second well is drilled on each pad. What that points to is the need to be patient and waiting for well results as the year goes on because it will be quite a long timeframe between when the first well is spudded and the first and second well are put on production.","Now turning to Slide 15. As for the type curves, our key wells are still performing beautifully. If you look at the DL Hutt well, it's shown on the blue on the graph, it's now made about 100,000 BOE in just over 100 days. So needless to say, a phenomenal well. Our Jo Mill well, shown in the orange color, are doing well also for a seasonably relatively short laterals. When these are normalized to 5,000 feet, you can see they're exceeding the 650,000 BOE type curve, which is the dash line on the graph. And our Giddings wells, of course, these are now some quite a long time in production, almost 1.5 years, but they're substantially over the 650,000 type curve even though they're only about 5,300-foot laterals. What you can see in the graph, if you look there between days 240 and 270 is a substantial benefit from putting these wells after -- or on artificial lift. You may recall, most of these wells -- these 2 wells were flowed naturally before that, and you can see the benefit of artificial lift. So needless to say, we're very pleased with these results and think they bode very well for our future drilling success in both the north and the south.","Then finally, on Slide 16, looking at the next 2 years of the horizontal campaign in the north. Really, what we're doing here is connecting the dots, as you can see on the map, in various zones. And the objective here is, across the 6 stacked laterals, to prove up this acreage, which we think, in the Wolfcamp and Jo Mill intervals, including the Spraberry acreage, to be some 3 billion BOE of potential reserves and potential resource. Production is increasing. Of course, expect that 2013 horizontal production will be 5,000 to 7,000 barrels a day. And at that point in time, as we get through the end of 2013, we'll be moving more up to about 8 rigs. So the idea is to use about $1 billion in 2013 and '14, so $400 million in 2013, $600 million in 2014, to continually -- to continue the appraisal program to test spacing optimization, just as we're doing in the south, and essentially learn what it is these various zones can deliver, so that we can then optimize our capital budget and our capital drilling campaigns in 2015 and beyond.","Turning to Slide 17. Of course, with all the excitements surrounding the horizontal campaign, it should be emphasized that the Spraberry vertical drilling program is still doing exceedingly well, especially based on the fact that we're drilling these wells in the case of 90% of the entire program to deeper intervals. So this is still a major contributor to our Permian performance. We are still operating 15 vertical rigs. They are required essentially such that we can meet continuous drilling obligations and preserve our leasehold for further incremental horizontal drilling on the same leasehold. And we drilled about 75 vertical wells in the first quarter or so, right on target with about 300 for the year. We did place 130 wells on production. We did decrease our frac bank by about 55 vertical wells in the first quarter. You may recall that we delayed some of the completions in the fourth quarter of 2012 so that we would match up our spending more closely with our cash flow in that year, as the horizontal campaign was being accelerated. But needless to say, these deeper zones, as shown on the table, had significant EUR and cover a substantial amount of our acreage.","And then, Slide 18 shows that, eventually, all of this activity finds its way to production. Excellent first quarter, up about 10% in terms of production of about 75,000 BOE. We did benefit from the frac bank reduction I just mentioned. But at the same time, we were hurt by the fact that we had about 2,700 barrels a day of ethane recoveries, which were reduced, as a result of having a full production and actually exceeded capacity in our Spraberry gas processing facilities. That's now essentially been alleviated. The 200 million cubic feet a day plant at Driver has now come online during the mid part of the last month, and we're in the process of alleviating that ethane recovery issue, as we speak, as we continue to add gas into that system. Overall horizontal production is expected to increase from only about 2,000 barrels a day last year to 11,000 to 14,000 barrels a day this year. And of course, that includes the fact that we will be conveying production to Sinochem at the -- after the closing of that transaction.","Turning to Slide 19 and specifically talking about Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford team had a phenomenal quarter and continues to set production records in that asset, 37,000 BOE, up about 12% from the fourth quarter. They're very much on target to drill their campaign. They've drilled 37 wells, 35 having been put on production, and anticipate drilling about 130 wells this year. Those are effectively almost 100% all liquids-rich wells. We're minimizing any sort of dry gas drilling, as we speak. The economics on the oil and condensate drillings is so much better than natural gas drilling even with an increase in natural gas prices. And we're also substantially increasing pad drilling to about 80% of the program. It saves about $600,000 to $700,000 per well. And one of the results of that is we can drill, because of the efficiencies of pad drilling, the same number of wells with less rigs. This year, we used 10 rigs to drill 130 wells, where it took 12 last year.","Just as we're doing in the Wolfcamp, we are evaluating downspacing. We are testing, as we speak, 70- to 80-acre spacing in our oily areas of the Eagle Ford and perhaps into some of the liquids-rich areas, and then perhaps even down to 40 acres in some areas. So we'll be giving you more information, as those results are seen.","We're continuing to push the envelope with the use of white sand as opposed to ceramic proppant. It's now anticipated that 70% of our program will use white sand, which reduces the cost of the fracs by some $700,000. So that's a very important thing to continue to push with regard to the technology of the use of white sand as deep as we can do so. We're effectively completed with most of our central gas processing facilities. We'll add one more next year. So in summary, Eagle Ford is hitting on all cylinders, and we expect this level of performance to continue into the future.","On Slide 20. In the Barnett Shale Combo Play, we've added a second rig. You can see production is about 9,000 barrels a day. We anticipate that to increase, as we put this rig to work. We have about 20,000 acres held by production. There's about a 40,000 acres or so that we -- of our total 60,000 additional acreage that we believe are prospective and in more liquids-rich drilling, and that will be the basis of a 2-rig campaign over the next 3 years to make sure we can preserve that leasehold.","The team has done an outstanding job in terms of reducing well costs. In fact, they recently drilled wells in less than 8 days, bringing the well costs in under $3 million for a 5,000-foot lateral. And accordingly, our economics have improved quite substantially, considering our well costs have come down at the same time we've seen improvements in natural gas prices.","Turning to Slide 21, Alaska. Scott already alluded to some of the results here, but I'll give you a little bit more granularity. Our winter campaign is essentially complete, and we're just right now in the process of evaluating the results in the form of how these wells are going to produce. First quarter production was about 4,000 barrels a day. You may recall that, on the island, we drilled a very successful Nuiqsut well in 2012 and put a diverted -- mechanically diverted frac on that well. It has now made 685,000 barrels in 1 year, so it's a phenomenal well. So that led us to then drill 4 more wells from the island that we would frac this winter. Those fracs have now been done. Two of the wells are on production. Scott gave you the rates on those, about 3,500 and 3,000 barrels a day and still unloading. So we'll see eventually where they IP. The 2 additional wells we anticipate bringing on production this month. So we'll be able to give you more information on that, as we get the wells on production and they unload. We will have a little bit of downtime in the second quarter, as our third-party processing partner will be having some downtime. It'll be about a 10-day to 2-week window in the second half of June, in which we'll be shut in, but we already have that factored into our guidance.","The Torok well to the south is very interesting. We had originally drilled the first of the Torok tests in 2012. That well came in exceedingly well. And in fact, we went back in and retested that well this first quarter. And it produced at about 2,800 barrels a day on a gross basis even with facility limitations that tend to occur on the north slope. But that's substantially better than the tests even we had last year when we were even more facility-constrained. The well we just drilled this winter looks excellent. The logs look quite excellent in the Torok. In fact, they confirm really high-quality reservoir rock. And we had planned to production test that well. But after moving the rig off location and rigging up for the completion, we found we had a mechanical problem in the well that would require remobilization of the rig. But it was too late to remobilize a rig based on the winter season and the ice needs -- and the ice conditions to do so, such that we had to suspend operations. But logs from the well look excellent and give us confidence to be able to increase the resource potential from this Torok zone to about 75 million to 100 million barrels from about 50 million.","So with that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for his review of the financials and guidance for the second quarter.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. Let's start on Slide 22. For the quarter, net income was $101 million or $0.75 per diluted share. It didn't include mark-to-market derivative losses of $60 million or $0.45 and unusual items of income totaling $25 million or $0.18 per diluted share. So as Scott mentioned, after adjusting for the mark-to-market losses and the unusual items, we're at $136 million or $1.02 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of this slide where we showed -- or put out our first quarter guidance, and you can see our results. If you look at that, we were in guidance -- on the positive side of guidance in all those items. I won't go through those in detail, but an excellent quarter as both Scott and Tim have mentioned.","Looking at Slide 23, on price realizations. You can see, on oil, we are up 6% versus the fourth quarter to $88.57. If you look at NGLs and gas, both those were down slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Given what the recent run-up in gas prices, we'd expect the second quarter to be better, NGLs probably more of the same what we've seen in the last 2 or 3 quarters.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the positive impact that's incremental to these prices from our derivative portfolio. That's included in derivative gains and losses on the income statement.","Turning to Slide 24. Production costs came in at $14.52 for the quarter. They're essentially flat with the fourth quarter. So things are going as expected there, and would expect the same as we move to the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 25. In the company's liquidity position and financial position, very strong financial position with $2.4 billion of net debt, excluding the MLP debt. Great liquidity position with $430 million of cash on the balance sheet, completely undrawn $1.5 billion credit facility out there, so in good shape financially. One thing, for those that may have missed it, we did call for redemption, the remaining about $200 million of convertible bonds that were outstanding. That will be completed in mid-May. And after that is completed, we would expect our outstanding shares to be about 138 million to 139 million shares.","Turning to Slide 26 and second quarter guidance. As Scott and Tim both talked about production, well, it's continuing to increase in the second quarter. We're projecting 174,000 to 179,000 BOEs per day, primarily driven by Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, Eagle Ford, Alaska. The rest of the items on this page are similar to what they've been in past quarters. So I'm not going to go through each one of those in detail, but they're there for your review. At this point, we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of fairly high-level questions. If I look on Slide 16, your -- I think you cannot talk about -- this is joining the dots, I guess. But as I recollect, all this acreage to the north has long been held by production. So why such a diverse appraisal program as opposed to a more concentrated development program in what clearly looks like a phenomenal bunch of acreage that's already held?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Doug, as you can see, on that Slide 16, our northern appraisal program, we're testing the larger blocks that we hold. So you can see where the yellow comes together. These were where we have some of our biggest acreage blocks. We think it's important to prove up. Obviously, the Wolfcamp B, we're very confident of that, and then eventually start looking at the Cline or the Wolfcamp D. And then, we'll be testing 3 Spraberry shale intervals. So these are all where our biggest blocks are, and that's the focus. But if we see tremendous results like on the well we did in Midland County, the Hutt well, obviously, we'll be refocusing rigs there over the next 2 years on the better areas. So the goal is to prove up our acreage even though 80% of it is held by production. There's only about 20% that's not. But it's really to cover our big acreage positions going all the way up to the north.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. [indiscernible] So I guess we should expect that once you've gone through this, you'll concentrate the rigs back in what you see as the best areas. Is that a fair assessment?","Scott D. Sheffield","Exactly, yes.","Timothy L. Dove","And I'd say best areas in best zones, right?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, both.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, right. So I guess my follow-up, if I may take another one, is, Tim, on the lateral lands, obviously, there's been a lot of normalizing to longer lands. What is the limitation on drilling? I guess, if we could maybe segregate it [indiscernible] the northern acreage, what is the limitation that you're going for the longer laterals? Is it just the connectivity of the blocks, or because you've got this pretty well blocked up?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, very clearly. The only limitation, let's say, when you're going from 7,000 to 10,000 feet is the leasehold position, and do you have the contiguous leasehold in position, such that you can cross leasehold and be able to get out to the 10,000-foot level? Of course, in a lot of areas, what we're trying to do is work deals where we can either acquire or work with the offset leases that we don't own to make sure we can drill the longer laterals. So I think what was going to happen is, through time, you'll see us further moving towards longer laterals, where we can do so.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the final one, Scott, I guess, this one will be for you. I know I've asked you this before, but I'm going to try it again. An enormous resource clearly. And if the multiple zones work, what is the longer-term plan as to how you pursue optimal development?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. Doug, I think the -- obviously, with our production growth CAGR of 13% to 18%, we're still using a 500,000 barrel type curve to generate that. And so, I think the key is if we can make wells more like the Giddings, say, 700,000, 750,000 or up to the Hutt type wells, 1 million barrels of oil equivalent, then we'll be -- our wells that pay out in 5 months -- the Hutt looks like it may pay out in about a 5- to 6-month timeframe. If we can make those type wells, we'll be generating enough production growth and cash flow to be able to take this company forward for the next several years and substantial double -- to high-double digit production growth rates. So we really don't need funding sources if we make those type wells.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But in terms of optimizing value, Scott, would there be a route to perhaps monetizing part of this, or is that off the table?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, we're not even considering it right now. So we're putting any decisions off until we get an idea of what these 3 Spraberry shale zones are going to do and what the B and the D zones are going to do over the next 2 years. We'll be making that decision by, say, the end of '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I actually had 2. Let me just to start off with. Can you talk about -- or could you tell us how big the Hutt lease is? And really, what I'm after is, is with the rig that's going to be dedicated there, is this going to be drilling a dense spacing pilot, or is this going to -- is this a significantly sized lease that's going to be spread around?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. We've picked up really 2 or 3 Hutt leases over the last 20 years from some major oil companies. And so, it's a huge lease. One thing interesting that we don't comment on is that it's 93% net revenue. So there's only a 7% royalty on a lot of these leases. And so, that's another reason why we're focused on that -- on those areas also. So it's a huge area, a lot of it development drilling and very high net revenue interest.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then, the second question I had, it goes back -- I think Doug may have touched on this in his earlier question. With the normalizing of the well curves for the Jo Mill, is that just a scale or multiple based on lateral length that you do to normalize those curves up?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Charles. Of course there's a lot of data in shale plays that support the idea that you have quite a strong correlation between lateral length and productivity. In this case, we haven't drilled a 5,000-foot lateral. The couple of wells we drilled are 2,500. But we believe that you'll get a linear effect -- or a linear multiple -- or scaler multiple effectively by doubling the lateral length. And so, we'll, of course, be reporting more as the next wells we drill in Jo Mill will in fact be 5,000-foot lateral. So we'll be able to tell you more definitively once those wells are done. But we think, conceptually, it still points to the direction that the wells are performing at pretty solid rates.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And this would just be the last follow-up, but is it going too far then, because when I looked at your slide, I believe at Slide 13 that has those well curves on it -- actually it's 15. You have the Hutt, which is 7,400-foot lateral against those Jo Mill at 5,000. If you just bumped up the Jo Mill by another 50%, that would seem to imply that the Jo Mill could be your best zone in this -- in the column.","Timothy L. Dove","It could easily be the case, Charles. If you think about the Jo Mill and the Spraberry shales in connection with those if they have excellent well performance similar to the Jo Mill. They also can be drilled cheaper than Wolfcamp wells, probably $1 million, $1.5 million less. And so, there's a double benefit if, in fact, they produce at this level. But you have to sort of tap the brake a little bit. We need to get some longer lateral Jo Mill wells drilled. We need to get these Spraberry shale wells drilled. And we'll know more in the fullness of time how they're going to produce.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gil Yang with DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","You've had some great results in Alaska. Can you talk about what you need to see to narrow that 75 -- that range of 75 to 100 million barrels further? And when I look at the map in terms of where those wells were drilled in the overall shaded area, how many more sort of parcels could you de-risk through appraisals? And I have a follow-up on that.","Scott D. Sheffield","Over the next 3 months, our Alaska team is going through the evaluation for the next winter program and in addition on whether or not we'll be sanctioning this project moving forward. And so, we'll know more information. But right now, we feel very good about these first 2 wells, Gil, in addition to the fact that we've drilled -- we have 2 other wells that are very successful on the island. So the team is working up that project right now with the recent change in the Alaska tax laws that looks very positive, again, for this project also going forward.","Timothy L. Dove","And just 1 additional note in that, Gil, and that is that we have 3D seismic in this area, and the wells -- well results very well correlate with that 3D. So it gives us a lot of confidence moving forward in those numbers that you mentioned.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Are there many additional, sort of, parcels that you can de-risk and add sort of 25 million, 50 million barrel increments? Or have you sort of fully de-risked that shaded area -- or into the resource potential category?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. Potentially to the south, we could add some resource potential because we -- these wells that you can see were drilled off the land heading a little bit to the northwest. But suffice it to say, we think we're getting in that range, 75 to 100 million barrels, based on the data we have.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. And what is the -- what are the results in the new tax laws you -- make you think about in terms of how to best capture the value for this asset? Is it to produce it or to sell it down the road?","Scott D. Sheffield","They have substantially reduced the taxes on producing properties going forward. That's the big benefit.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Right. But do you -- or does it make you think about selling this, or do you think the best thing to do is to produce it out as part of Pioneer?","Scott D. Sheffield","Right now, we are evaluating the entire project. And so, we'll be making those decisions over the next several months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just go back to some of the comments that you made earlier on in your opening with regards to 70-acre spacing. I think you mentioned that you are testing -- or you think you can head down a 70-acre spacing in the south. Can you just add some more clarity on your views there and to what extent that is based on tests that you've done, results that you've seen from others or just where you're seeing other plays?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. We have 3 wells right now that we're testing on 100-acre spacing. So we're clear on that, in the south. We have plans to potentially reduce that further to 70, and then perhaps even less than that. So it's early stages, Brian, but we're sort of taking baby steps. We're heading down from the more of the 140 to now 100, and we'll be further testing from there. It's important though that we get our arms around spacing because we want to do it as early as possible in the development campaign. We want to make sure that, as we go forward, we land on what's optimal spacing per zone, so that we can then optimally develop. So this is something you're going to see more information from us regarding, let's just say, the downspacing in this year and next year's campaign. We really need that as data points as we develop the 2015 onward plan.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, you highlighted a few different reasons for the stronger-than-expected -- stronger-than-guidance production during the quarter. Can you add a little bit more granularity? Was this based on better vertical well performance because you got better and greater contributions than expected from the deeper zones? Was it just based on timing of when wells came on? Or was it more horizontal driven?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's still -- you saw where Eagle Ford way overperformed up substantially. And when you look at the Permian, it's a combination of the Wolfcamp horizontal plus bringing on several wells that are combined with the Spraberry, D and Wolfcamp and all the way down to the Strawn and the Atoka. So it's really a combination of both. And obviously, we did reduce our frac bank on the vertical program also.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arun Jayaram with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Quick thoughts here. Guys, seeing a positive rate of chain story in terms of your southern Wolfcamp wells, you noted that the last 9 wells were at an IP rate of 911 BOEs per day. Tim, this -- or, Scott, this compared to the prior 21 wells at 674 BOEs per day, yet you kept your type curve flat. So a couple of questions. One, what is driving this improved well performance? And I'm just being conservative on the type curve because the well results did get better in the south.","Scott D. Sheffield","It's a combination of longer laterals and also refocusing more of our sweet spots among the 200,000 acres. It's a combination of both.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just being conservative on the type curve. Is that fair?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And just second question. As you shift to putting a couple of rigs towards the Jo Mill and Spraberry, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment on the thickness of the section -- of each of those sections compared to the Wolfcamp, which I believe, at some cases, can be up to 800-foot thick? And just comment a little bit around that.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. Well, first of all, if you're talking about Wolfcamp, Wolfcamp is 2,000 to 2,500 feet thick. It depends on where you are. What you're referring to in the sense of the thickness...","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The B.","Timothy L. Dove","Of Wolfcamp is really the Wolfcamp B, which, especially in the south, is something like 800-feet thick. You actually can see this pretty clearly on Slide 13 that I had already gone through. And so, going through these shales, you can see that --. Well, first of all, talking about Jo Mill, Jo Mill is really about a 30-foot general -- a 30-foot interval. Basically, it's a silty, sandy zone. So clearly, from a micro seismic standpoint, it -- we can determine that the fracs in the first 2 Jo Mills were actually going up into the Jo Mill shale, as shown there on Slide 13. And so, that's where we're getting the contributions. The Jo Mill in and of itself could never produce as well as these wells have, given it's only a 30-foot interval. So we're clearly seeing shale contributions. But you can see on there that if you look at the Wolfcamp -- I'm sorry, if you look at the Jo Mill shale, which sits above the Jo Mill, it's probably in the neighborhood of 800 feet or so itself, and the lower Spraberry shale, maybe more like a 1,000 feet. So you have a substantial potential considering the size of these shales.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great. And my last question maybe for Frank is, you guys have a full year target of 86 wells in the south and up north, 30 to 40. You did 9 wells up in the south in the first quarter and 1 in the north. Frank, how do you expect the cadence to proceed as you get your rigs in terms of completion through the rest of the year?","Frank E. Hopkins","Well, I think what's happened is we just ramped up to 7, I'm talking about the south now, at the beginning of the year. And so, we were just kicking off the 7-rig program we had been at 4. So I think what you'll see is that, as we go forward, you're going to get a lot more wells now with 7 rigs. And that 86 target, in our opinion, at this point, is pretty achievable. No issues there. And in the north, the north kind of reminds me of the south from last year where we started out with 1 rig, and then we got up to 4 rigs in the second half of the year. And basically, I think we drilled around 30 wells -- 30, 35 wells last year in south. And so, what you're going to see in the north is something very similar where we're ramping up here in the second quarter. And by the time we get to the second half of the year, you're going to see an acceleration, not only in the number of wells, but obviously, the Street's looking for results from those wells, which we talked about this morning. So again, achieving that 30- to 40-well target, we think, is very achievable at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mario Barraza with Tuohy Brothers.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just can we revisit your guidance for a bit for this year and '14 and '15? You said that the current guidance excludes a Hutt type curve. But are you using the 575,000 barrel equivalent run rate for '13 through '15 right now?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, it ranges between 500,000 and 575,000.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And in this year's guidance, comparing to last quarter's presentation, you guys upped the average lateral length from 7,800 feet to 8,300 feet. When you were compiling the guidance, was that increase factored into the current numbers?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, it has not been. This was all done before then.","Mario Barraza - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And then, if I can jump back to your spacing, what's the average lateral length you're trying for right now in the south when you're testing on 100 acres? And as you mentioned the possibility of downspacing to, say, longer term to possibly 40 acres, what type of lateral length do you think you could work there? Could actually a 10,000-foot lateral be a possibility?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. I think the way you have to think about this is that the lateral length is sort of independent of the spacing. I mean, if you're looking at a 100-acre spacing, that's just dictating how close the wells are going to be to each other, but it has nothing to do with the lateral length. Lateral length is essentially dependent upon the lease configuration only. So we can drill stacked laterals at 40 acres just as we could if it was at 100 acres or 140 acres in the different zones.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly. Looking at the well costs estimates that you guys gave us, if we think of southern well costs $7.5 million to $8 million, is that pre-factoring in moving to the slickwater fracs? I'm just trying to think about, as we move to develop that, what that means and probably extend that question into the Eagle Ford as well with the savings from white sands and pad drilling and the impact to well costs there.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. We're actually including a small amount of effects of slickwater, but not the full amount because we're not factoring in that we may use it on the vast majority of the wells. So I think there's more as running room to reduce these numbers, both in the north and the south, to the extent we go to a full slickwater frac program. And as we mentioned in the call, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of $800,000 to $1 million per well savings. So it is -- it's clearly the direction we're going. But we've just drilled a few wells and completed them with slickwater. So we want to make we're doing the right thing and the early data looks very, very good. But in most of the data you see on the well costs, both to the north and south, have very little factoring for the use of slickwater.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that. And then, following on in the Eagle Ford, you're clear in your comment to say that you're not going to be pushing the drill bit aggressively on the gas side even the gas prices have gone up. Does that potentially make the gas acreage -- or gas-level acreage there a monetization candidate for you guys, especially in a better balanced gas market?","Timothy L. Dove","Oh, I don't know, Dave. We're kind of in the process of seeing where natural gas prices are going to go. Right now, we do have a substantial amount of our acreage held by production. So that's something that we can assess through time. We have about 80% of our acreage held by production. So we can assess that. As liquids-rich as we are in terms of opportunities, we're just not getting around to any amount of dry gas drilling even at $4.25 or $4.40, whatever it may be today. So that probably will just continue to be the case. I mean, we'll look at the concept you're talking about of monetization, but it's certainly not in our front burner right now.","Frank E. Hopkins","Yes. Hello, Dave. This is Frank. Just to remind you that even last year, it wasn't a big amount. But we just let some acreage -- dry gas acreage go that we decided wasn't economic to drill. So that's an opportunity -- or I shouldn't say an opportunity, but that's the -- a possible outcome for at least some dry gas acreage.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that clarification. And then, one last one relative to downspacing. I know incredibly early when we think about this in the northern section, but you'd made the comment trying to get after downspacing as early as possible. How do you balance downspacing versus attacking 5, 6, 7 different intervals?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think the way we will do this is drill offset wells in -- on these pads where we can to prove up downspacing concepts. So in that case, you'd be actually drilling the same zones on the same pad. So we'll be doing that in some cases, so in order to address this question of downspacing. In other case, we'll be drilling multiple zones from the same pad. So we just got to learn what it is that, number one, all of these zones can yield. At the same time, we got to understand how to further appraise those in the future in terms of how they need to be downspaced. So we have to achieve both of those objectives between now and the end of 2014.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And I guess, just not to belabor the point, but should we be then thinking about production, kind of, being very stair step or choppy oriented because of the time related to pad drilling and actually bringing wells online as opposed to more of a smooth progression through the next, kind of, 1.5 years or so?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, precisely, Dave. You're onto something there. What we're going to see is -- I mentioned this on the call. But if you think about pad drilling, we drill the first well, drill the second well, complete the first well, complete the second well, put them both on production. That's a pretty substantial timeline door-to-door from the spudding of the first well to putting both wells on production, and now they'll have a substantial impact when they do so. But the fact is you had a stair step effect, especially considering in the north, where we're just going to have our 5 rigs running there at the end of this month essentially. So you'll -- what you're going to see is a couple of effects. One is stair stepping in production. You're going to see a back-weighted growth trajectory, and you're going to see us only be able to talk about certain well results until the fullness of time allows us to do so. So you got to be patient with us, as we get -- we think that's the most efficient way to drill the wells, but it's not the most efficient way to get information out. But we'll do our best.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Oatman with SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","On the Wolfcamp A, can you talk about any pre-drill expectations you have there, and how you plan to complete that well versus the Wolfcamp B?","Scott D. Sheffield","No. It's still -- the Wolfcamp A is still based on our maps as one of the highest oil in place of any of the Wolfcamp zones. We've had 2 successful wells down to the south. Just to remind people, we have a couple of our wells that went into some faults. And so, we did not get good fracs off 2 of our wells that we've drilled. This well, we are not doing anything differently than our B fracs. And so, we'll be frac-ing that here in the next few weeks and getting those results.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, can you speak for your plans for the Wolfcamp B? When should we have results there?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think the D -- I think the first D well is spudding in the next, probably, 4 weeks. And so, it will take about 30 to 45 days to drill and then probably another 30 days to complete. So you're probably off about 3 months.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. Perhaps we should make comments at the next earnings call about D zones.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Very good. And then, one final one for me, if I may. It sounds like you're seeing somewhat encouraging results in the south by switching to slickwater completions. One of your peers and its vertical program has applied those somewhat successfully, it would appear. What are your plans for slickwater versus gel just broad-based as you think about both the vertical and the horizontal program?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I mean, the fact is, with the cost savings we're staring at with slickwater and with the results to-date, which is to say we're seeing similar well performance from slickwater as compared to hybrid gel-conveyed fracs, I think it's leaning -- we're leaning towards the idea that more slickwater is better. But we want to make sure we make the right decision on that. We're going to look at the data set. One of the real benefits of using gel as opposed to slickwater is we're using less water with gel. So there's an -- there's several offsetting factors as well. But needless to say, the cost savings associated with slickwater will probably rule the day. And I think that's probably the direction it goes, more slickwater versus less.","Operator","And our last question today will come from Kyle Rhodes with RBC.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Real quick. Just wondering what your longer-term strategy for your vertical integration division is. Is that something that you guys are looking to grow in conjunction with your accelerated drilling program, or what?","Scott D. Sheffield","Right now, with the -- our CapEx, we'll be completing our expansion, most of it for the sand mine. So we don't see much there going into '14, '15. In regard to pumping services, we anticipate going out. And any future needs based on today's economics, we will probably be going to third-parties. We'll probably continue to buy a few pulling units, work-over units per year like we have been. So that's probably about it. So it will be reduced substantially. If we ever get back into a very competitive market, where prices were as high as they have been the last 2.5, 3 years, then obviously we're going to reevaluate.","Operator","And with no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sheffield for any final and closing remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again, thanks. We appreciate everyone participating. We know you had other potential calls during this timeframe. Hope that you consider our call the most important one. Again, we look forward to seeing everybody. Everybody have a great summer, and we'll see you on the road sometime.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, Annette, and good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 conference call.","I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim is going to be up first. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the fourth quarter of 2017 and also take a look back at the highlights that were generated last year. He'll also discuss our plans for 2018, followed by a progress report on how we're tracking towards achieving the operating and financial targets in our 10-year plan.","After Tim concludes his remarks, Joey will review our strong horizontal well performance in the Permian Basin, which is resulting from our successful completion optimization program. He'll also provide details regarding our 2018 Permian Basin drilling program.","Lastly, Rich will update you on our increasing oil takeaway capacity for Midland to the Gulf Coast and the financial benefits we're receiving from growing oil exports and having the ability to move oil to the Gulf Coast. He'll also cover the fourth quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the first quarter. And as usual, after that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","So, Tim, I'll turn the call over to you.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Frank, and welcome, everybody.","Pioneer's fourth quarter results were quite strong, and they reflect our continuing high drilling and completion-level returns. And that of course results in impressive production growth that we've seen from the campaign.","We'll also be discussing several other topics this morning, some that are very important to 2018 initiatives later in the call. And they'll include matters regarding our 2018 capital budget, our year-end reserves disclosure, our planned divestiture program, our long-term return and cash flow metrics, and an increase in our dividend coupled with a share buyback program.","But first, what I wanted to do is review our fourth quarter results. And turning to slide 3, we reported fourth quarter 2017 income of about $209 million or $1.22 per diluted share. Importantly, we also exceeded our production guidance range by 3,000 barrels a day, ending up on a BOE basis at 305,000 BOE per day.","Production was up substantially in the quarter, up about 11% on a BOE basis compared to the third quarter. But more importantly, our oil production growth was also up substantially, about 11% versus the third quarter.","The fourth quarter finished off a year which saw total production increase substantially. In fact, it increased about 16% year on year on a BOE basis. But our oil production grew even more significantly, up about 19% year on year. So 2017 ended up being a very strong year for Pioneer.","Of course, that growth was driven by our Permian Basin horizontal drilling program. And focusing just on the Permian Basin oil production for 2017, it grew 26%. So it's reflective of what we anticipate being strong growth rates going forward.","Importantly, we've also done a good job of keeping production costs in tow. We've kept a lid on them essentially, and in fact, we've reduced production cost per BOE by about 12% compared to last year. That's in large part due to cost reduction initiatives, but also the fact we bring in more low-cost Permian horizontal wells into our mix in the fullness of time.","We announced separately in a press release yesterday very strong finding costs and reserve replacement data. It's also a product of our prolific Permian Basin oil resource and exceptionally strong economics of drilling of that resource.","I'm going to turn now to slide 4 and focus in on the financial and operating highlights further, and that's to say we continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the entire energy patch. Our balance sheet ends the year with about $2.2 billion of cash on hand with very strong debt metrics.","We placed 64 wells on production in the fourth quarter. Eight of those were Version 3.0+ wells. We'll have a later slide in which we'll cover the fact that these wells on average, if you look at the 3.0+ completions to date, have averaged some 30% to 40% uplift after about 200 days.","We also announced a very significant well, that being our first Wolfcamp D well featuring a Version 3.0 completion in Midland during the fourth quarter, really one of our best wells ever in the Permian Basin if you look at just on the early production data, in particular, a 3,600 BOE per day IP rate and then substantial cumulative production over 45 days of about 120,000 BOE of oil.","A significant value driver continues to be our ability to trade acreage in the Permian Basin. We added about 7.2 million lateral feet. That's a tremendous value adder in the sense that it makes the pie bigger, and that would represent, depending upon the speed of development of the lateral feet that were added, some $5 billion to $10 billion of incremental value from those trades.","We've successfully completed the Eagle Ford campaign. That of course included 9 DUCs and 11 new drills last year. Those resulted in very strong well production rates from higher intensity completions, and that puts us in good stead with regard to the potential sale of the Eagle Ford I'll discuss in just a moment.","We also have been increasing the volumes we're selling into the Gulf Coast refining system and the volumes of export. Their size and impact will continue to increase as to their effect on our results. We exported about 90,000 barrels a day of oil production during the fourth quarter to Asia and Europe, and that amount will be similar it appears in the first quarter.","Importantly, what that does is add incremental value because of the premium that's associated with the Brent-WTI differential we've been experiencing over the last few months. It added about $15 million of incremental cash flow in the fourth quarter, the fact that we could actually export oil and also ship it to the Gulf Coast.","Going now to slide 5, I'm going to be turning now to our plans for 2018. And yesterday we also announced in a separate press release that we plan to divest of all the assets that are essentially non-Permian. So that includes our Eagle Ford assets, other South Texas assets, our Raton assets in southeastern Colorado, and our West Panhandle assets in the panhandle of Texas. That will result in making Pioneer a pure Permian Basin player.","I also want to note for everyone, these assets have been part of our portfolio for decades, in some cases multiple decades, and they've been significant contributors to the company's success over the years. So our thanks go out to the many outstanding Pioneer employees who have been a part of that history.","And we believe though, that all said, taking these steps will be a positive for the company on many fronts. Certainly, once the divestitures are completed, it will increase our reported rate of growth because we'll just be focusing on Permian growth rates. It will increase our reported revenue per BOE, reduce our operating expense per BOE, therefore improving our reported margins and, further to that, our corporate returns.","And so it does a lot for the company. We expect the data rooms will be open probably later this quarter, probably the end of February into early March. It will take time to execute these transactions simply because there are a lot of moving parts and, needless to say, there's a few assets that need to be dealt with. But we should see results through time, probably some potentially in the second quarter and some in the third quarter. So just bear with us as we execute on this plan.","I think one of the most important points about this sale is that it will allow us to not only become, as I said, a Permian pure play, but actually it also makes us the only Midland Basin public pure play. And I think that's important because that's where all of our assets are. That's where we're going to be focusing. One of the effects of this is the company becomes more oily on a percentage basis, which I think helps in the face of current commodity prices.","As to the rig count and back to operations, we are going to continue with the current rig plan we have in place and have had since the fourth quarter; that is 16 rigs operating in the north and four in the south in the Wolfcamp JV area. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter, a couple of those rigs in the north are building DUC inventories so that we can make sure we improve our flexibility, in which case they'll be turned to more production-oriented activities as we get to the second half of the year and into 2019. For the year, we're anticipating POPs of 250 to 275 wells.","Part of our efforts to reduce costs include reducing the number of four-string wells we'll be utilizing in the program for 2018. We anticipate that number to be about 50% of the wells as opposed to about 75% in the second half of last year.","For the time being, we're going to be testing additional Version 3.0+ wells, a total of 45. Those will be anticipated to be completed in the first half of the year. I think once we've had a chance to look at the results of those wells and completed them, we'll then evaluate the next steps after we see the results from the wells.","It could easily involve utilizing more Version 3.0+ wells on the remaining part of the campaign this year, realizing more and more as we go through time completions have to be customized. They have to be customized based on the area we're drilling, the target zone, the spacing of the wells, what is the situation vis-\u00e0-vis offset wells and so on in order to optimize the completions.","And so for the time being, in terms of our planning and what you see in our numbers, we're assuming the remaining wells for 2018 would only be Version 3.0 completions. But stand by, we'll see exactly how that changes in the second half. And accordingly, what we have built into our production forecast reflects that completion mix for the time being.","Now I'm going to turn to slide 6, little bit more detail surrounding the 2018 plan. We anticipate that the drilling program will again deliver really excellent results, growth in the Permian Basin oil production rates of 19% to 24%. And that also corresponds to a similar BOE production rate of growth; that is, 19% to 24% compared to 2017.","And we're still seeing very strong economics. We see IRRs about 65% today. That includes facilities costs, but importantly, that's all based on $55 and $3. So to the extent we have commodity prices maintained where they currently are or strip prices in that sense, we'll be able to achieve substantially over that rate of IRR as we process the plan if that were to continue.","I have more detail in a minute on slide 10, but our capital program is shown here summarized at $2.9 billion. You can see the splits there between drilling and completions and other infrastructure needs.","We're assuming right now that the industry will be facing somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% cost inflation. When you net out what we do internally in terms of our vertical integration, that would end up being about 5% net inflation to the company. And then I anticipate by some of the steps were taking regarding efficiency gains and optimization, we will offset that 5%. So net-net, we're not really baking in any inflation to speak of in our planning.","The cash flow, of course, looks very robust. At the $55 and $3 case, it's $2.8 billion. Of course, we'll have the proceeds from asset divestitures, we hope, as well as cash on hand to fund that.","The capital program for our drilling and completion costs and related capital costs is expected to be basically cash flow breakeven if we were to achieve $58. So we have a chance actually with the current commodity prices to be in excess of our capital needs for our oil and gas operations for 2018.","We still remain well hedged, about 85% on oil, 60% for gas based on the Permian production. And where our caps on the three-way collars would otherwise be struck at a place below where current prices are, we are definitely enhanced by the fact that we're selling oil and gas into the Gulf Coast markets, into export markets at premiums that offset the effect of that cap to a great extent.","Now I'm going to turn to slide 7. And when you couple our current balance sheet with the potential for the proceeds from the divestitures and then you look at our potential going forward, it's very clear the company's financial flexibility is a clear strength. And toward that end, we anticipate paying off our debt maturity, which comes in May this year, $450 million from cash on hand.","Our debt statistics are expected to remain very strong. And based on all of that, we anticipate an excellent year from a financial standpoint. And as a result, the company has increased its semi-annual per-share dividend from $0.04 to $0.16, effective here coming up in the end of the first quarter into the second quarter.","We also have announced our plans to initiate a common stock repurchase program associated with the dilution that would otherwise be associated with stock compensation awards to employees and their long-term incentive plans. That will be in effect for 2018. And stay tuned, you'll have to wait until April, but then you'll see that we're going to incorporate metrics in our compensation goals that are per-share based and returns-based for 2018.","I'm going to turn now to slide 8. And now stepping back and looking at things from a bigger picture perspective, we're now in year two of our 10-year plan, and this slide encapsulates what is behind that vision. First and foremost, our cost structure is really what's the most important driver. Our cost structure in the Midland Basin is very clearly industry-leading. And you can see that on the left-hand graph here, in which we're showing our actual 2017 Permian horizontal cost structure. This is fully burdened for G&A and interest on a BOE basis.","And what you can see very clearly is that if you sum all those costs up, we are able to put barrels on production for essentially $19 on average. And so as a low-cost producer with that $19 basis in our costs, it's clear why our 10-year plan works, even at oil prices substantially lower than where they are today. It's because our returns are essentially industry-leading.","We show that on the right in a set of graphs. We start with the fact that we're drilling low-cost and high-return, very prolific oil wells in the Permian Basin. That's where it all starts. And with that having been said, what that allows us to do is to grow our corporate ROCE annually, to grow our annual cash flow, and to generate free cash flow in the model. In fact, it shows us generating free cash flow at $50 in 2020 if that were to be the commodity price. And, incidentally, it reduces our cash flow breakeven price on an oil price basis annually as we bring the wells on production at high margin.","So the output of all that actually is the fact that as a low-cost, high rate of return driller, the model is consistent. What it yields then is long-term growth at any kind of reasonable commodity price in the form of production. And so what's clear through all this is this is not growth for growth's sake. This is a returns-based model. We believe it's going to work because we have an inventory that supports it, and we're going to go execute on this plan.","Going to slide 9, this is the way to think about it from a longer-term perspective as to how the long-term plan affects our financial metrics, and you can see that they improve significantly. If you look at the top left graph, for instance, you see that the cash flow modeling \u2013 this again is based on $55 and $3 \u2013 is a consistent CAGR of over 20%, which actually yields in the full plan period an increase to over $11 billion of cash flow, again based on $55 and $3, so substantial cash flow growth.","And importantly associated with that, you see at the bottom left graph significant improvements in returns. Of course, you expect that as we're drilling very high rate of return wells that as we drill those wells through time, we continue to positively impact our corporate return metrics, and that's shown here. It shows us actually increasing our ROCE from 5% to 15%. But in actuality, if you look at our internal modeling, we're actually adding 2% to 3% ROCE per year. So in actuality, if you look at 2023, our ROCE reaches 15% that year. Again, all of this is based on $55 and $3, so there's substantial return upside to the extent we actually have prices in excess of that.","If you look at the top right, and this has to do with the cash flow breakeven price, the price at which basis of oil prices our cash flow exceeds our capital needs for our oil and gas operations, you see that those cash flow breakeven numbers fall through time as we add high-return wells into our production mix. In fact, they go to as low as $40 during the plan period.","So in summary, I hope this gives everybody confidence that what our model suggests is that by drilling low-cost and very productive wells, in other words, high rate of return wells, especially with that cost structure struck at about $19, we can deliver cash flow growth. It's self-funding. In fact, it generates free cash flow, and provides for an attractive story indeed as we go forward. And that's what all of our employees are focused on as we embark upon the next 9 years in this 10-year plan.","So turning to page 10, as promised earlier, this is a little bit more granularity on this year's capital program. I won't go through this in detail because it's well laid out here in the graph. But it's a $2.9 billion capital program. The breakdown of drilling and completion is shown on the left. In addition, of course, we have other capital requirements related to infrastructure such as our pressure pumping, our well services, our water systems, field facilities, vehicles, and so on.","The program will be funded, as shown on the rainbow chart, from cash flow, currently estimated at $2.8 billion for a $55 and $3 case. Of course, that compares to $2.1 billion in 2017, so we're already seeing substantial cash flow growth between 2017 and 2018. Of course, some of that's pricing, but some of it also is attributable to our growth rates. But of course, we hope to have proceeds from our divestitures and our cash on hand to fund that program.","And turning to slide 11 then, here we're only showing our Permian Basin production forecast. It somewhat reflects what the company would look like post the divestitures. But you can see substantial growth rates.","First of all, if you look at the fourth quarter, we did have an excellent quarter in terms of production. However, our first quarter did get out a slow start, mostly, as shown in the box here, due to very cold temperatures in January. We lost about 6,000 BOE per day for the first quarter if you look at a quarter across the whole 90-day period. And that's because, of course, we had to shut in production and we had fracs that got delayed from this quarter into the second quarter. So the range you see of 252,000 to 260,000 BOE per day would have been higher by 6,000 BOE on each side of those numbers had we been able to avoid the freezing temperature situation.","But importantly, as we look forward and in particular if you look at the oil growth and the overall growth for 2018, you can see the range is 19% to 24% for this year. That's a robust rate of growth, no doubt. But then as you look even further towards the remaining 9 years in the 10-year plan, we're exhibiting growth rates of 20%-plus on our oil growth rates as well as our BOE growth rates. And so we still have very good visibility on exceeding a 1 million BOE per day target in 2026 over 700,000 barrels a day of oil in that same timeframe.","So to sum it up, we've taken some very important strides as we entered 2018. Returns are very robust. I think that production growth will be very strong. The balance sheet is pristine. And hopefully, divestitures are expected to do some very positive things for the company. We've taken a step towards our goal of returning cash to shareholders, as evidenced by the dividend increase and the announced share repurchases.","So with that, I'm going to pass it on the Joey. He can give you some more details and a Permian operational update.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone.","I'm going to start off on slide 12 and give an update on our Version 3.0+ completions. We did POP three new 3.0+ wells in the Pembrook area in Q4. The rest of the wells shown were POP'd in Q2 and now have six to nine months of production history. Well performance remains strong, with some of the wells showing 30% to 40% early-day uplifts compared to the 2.0 and 3.0 wells in similar areas. And because of these strong results, as Tim mentioned earlier, we do plan to test an additional 45 Version 3.0+ completions in the first half of this year.","But as Tim also mentioned, it's more important than ever to stress that one size definitely does not fit all when it comes to completion design. And as we progress, the number of recipes continues to grow. But as we zero in on our completion recipes, we do remain focused on delivering these large stimulations for the lowest cost possible and continue to evaluate new technologies. Some of the things we've been working on recently are a technology that allows our wireline operations to be performed safely while we're pumping and keeping people out of the safe zone but continuing to do work.","The sliding sleeve market continues to evolve rapidly, and we continue to look at that and plan on doing some more testing here in 2018, again, progressing on methods of diversion to potentially increase stage lengths while effectively stimulating all clusters and also looking at lower-cost fluid systems that also reduce the required pumping horsepower.","I'll be moving now to slide 13. We did POP 2 additional Jo Mill wells in Q4 in southern Martin County. They're just now approaching 2 months on production. These two new wells represent our second spacing pilot in the Jo Mill. The Q3 and Q4 wells were both 2-well pads and spaced at about 1,800 feet. The Q4 wells did have additional sand at about 2,500 pounds per foot, and the Q3 wells were stimulated with 1,400 pounds per foot. So we'll be able to see what the difference in larger stimulations does on the Jo Mill.","You are always going to notice some volatility in early-time results with the Jo Mill. This is typical as a result of artificial lift challenges that we typically face in the early phases of the well cleanup. We're still very encouraged by the Jo Mill, and these two pads are a critical step for other tests we will conduct in 2018 that I'll discuss here in a couple of slides.","I'm going to move now to slide 14. It's been a couple years since we POP'd the Wolfcamp D well, so our completions have obviously evolved over this time period. And we just recently POP'd a Wolfcamp D well in eastern Midland County. It's only been online for two months. But as you can see, it's significantly outperforming the 33 previous wells. This is quite meaningful to us considering that 60% of our acreage is prospective for the Wolfcamp D, so we're looking forward to further results in there.","Moving now to slide 15, as we progress on our long-term development strategy, it's time for us to come to the same level of understanding on developing the Spraberry intervals as we have in the Wolfcamp. As a part of our 2018 program, we're going to execute three pads and 19 wells where we're going to be testing various stacking, spacing, sequencing, and completion variables between the Middle Spraberry Shale, the Jo Mill, and Lower Spraberry Shale. We're also excited we're going to be POP-ing our first Clearfork well here very shortly. And we recently completed drilling on another Wolfcamp B 3-well pad in Reagan County, which will hopefully POP in Q2.","Now I'm going to be moving to slide 16. We are going to be staying at our 20 rigs throughout 2018. You can see there, we've included our budgeted well cost and estimated EURs. As Tim's already mentioned, our operating costs remain low and returns are very strong, especially on our 3.0 wells. You can see our activity mix there in the bottom right. It's really not too dissimilar to 2017, with some slight shifts in Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A and incorporating some Jo Mill and Middle Spraberry in conjunction with the Lower Spraberry Shale, as I mentioned previously.","Now I'm going to move on to slide 17 and my final slide. Here we discuss our infrastructure and vertical integration spending. We are highlighting for the first time our 24-well pad below-grade well cellars. We did begin to point on this concept in 2017. In essence, it reduces the surface acreage needed to develop an area by over 80% and allows simultaneous operations during drilling, completion, and production without shutting in the wells. It further reduces cost by centralizing facilities and reducing the number and length of flow lines.","Gas processing spend includes capital for two new plants that will be starting up in Q1 and Q3 of 2018 and two more additional plants slated for startup in Q1 and Q3 of 2019.","We continue to focus on expanding our water subsystems and minimizing freshwater use by constructing produced water reuse facilities. And we do plan to commence construction on the Midland wastewater treatment plant upgrade, with a startup in late 2020 or early 2021. Lastly, we are executing contracts for West Texas sand to get our sand cost as low as possible. And as a result of that, we're going to be delaying our expansion of the Brady sand mine.","Overall, a really good quarter for the Permian team and a great year, and we're looking forward to successful execution in 2018.","And I'm going to turn it over to Rich now to discuss marketing and financial highlights.","Richard P. Dealy - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Joey, and good morning. I'm going to start on slide 18, where we highlight our transportation arrangements to move our Permian Basin oil down to the Gulf Coast for either export or sales to the refineries.","Our growth aim for the fourth quarter \u2013 or currently we're transporting about 80% of our Permian Basin oil to the Gulf Coast. If you look in the upper left corner of slide 18, you'll see that the places that we're moving it, really equally the three major refinery and export hubs along the Texas Gulf Coast, that being Nederland, Corpus Christi, and Houston. Today we're exporting out of Nederland and Corpus Christi and plan to add Houston late this summer when the construction of the export facilities there are complete.","As Tim mentioned, we are exporting about 90,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. And when you add that to the Gulf Coast sales that we had, we added about $15 million of incremental cash flow during the quarter related to those sales. We do expect a similar amount of exports to be done in the first quarter. We've completed January and February sales, and we have one sale done in March and looking to complete March exports over the next couple weeks.","Currently, we are delivering about 160,000 barrels total to the Gulf Coast. About 110,000 of that can be exported today. And as I mentioned earlier, once the facilities are done midyear or so, that'll increase to about 150,000 barrels a day that can be exported. So long term, we continue to see ourselves exporting about 80% or so of our oil and getting it to the Gulf Coast, and then really we can sell it either to the Gulf Coast refineries or to the export markets, whichever offers the highest value.","Turning to slide 19 and focusing more on earnings, as Tim mentioned, we did have net income attributable to common stockholders of $665 million or $3.87 per diluted share. That did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses of $169 million or $0.99 per diluted share. That's primarily due to higher oil prices at the end of the year compared to the end of September.","We also benefited during the quarter from a reduction in our deferred tax liability related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in December. And effectively, what it did is reduced our future \u2013 or our tax obligations today from 35%, what they were booked in our records at down to 21%, so a big benefit hitting the quarter. So adjusting for those items, we're at $209 million of adjusted earnings or $1.22 per share.","Looking at the table at the bottom where we show our results of operations relative to guidance, you can see, as Tim mentioned, we exceeded our production goals. Then when you look at the rest of the items, they were within guidance or on the positive side of guidance. So overall, as you heard from Tim and Joey, excellent operational quarter, but also an excellent financial quarter for the company.","Turning to slide 20, looking at price realizations, as you can imagine, this was a big part of our strong quarterly results, where we see oil prices increased 16% quarter over quarter to $52.81. And similarly, we saw NGL prices up about 14% to $21.64. Virtually all the products were up when you break down our NGL sales. Looking at gas, gas was down slightly at 2%, so it was the only product that was slightly lower for the quarter.","We continue to benefit, that you can see at the bottom of the slide, from our hedging portfolio. So at the bottom there, you can see each of our products that we did bringing extra cash flow from our hedging portfolio.","Turning to slide 21, which is another significant contributor to the quarter, was a reduction in our production costs. So quarter on quarter, our production costs were down 6%. If you exclude taxes, which were up because of the higher commodity prices, production costs were actually down 11% versus Q3. And as Tim mentioned, the decline is primarily related to the increasing production from our low-cost horizontal Permian Basin wells that we're putting on. If you look at this quarter, the production cost excluding taxes was $1.87 related to those \u2013 the quarter, related to horizontal wells. If you look at it over the past two years, it's been under $2.25. So those low-cost wells, as we add more of those, will continue to drive down our operating costs.","Turning to slide 22, looking at our liquidity position, as I've mentioned in prior quarters and Tim noted it, we've got a pristine balance sheet. It's excellent liquidity. We ended the year at $2.2 billion of cash on hand. Our net debt was about $550 million. We have a completely unsecured credit facility. And we plan, given our balance sheet, to pay off our May maturity bonds that come due with cash on hand.","Turning to slide 23, a couple points to make here, this is our guidance for the first quarter. Just so everybody understands, this guidance includes all of our assets, and our guidance will continue to include all of our assets until the divestitures are completed. As Tim mentioned, we are forecasting for the total company 304,000 to 314,000 BOEs a day of production. That was impacted by the early January weather to the tune of about 6,000 BOEs a day of production for the quarter. So that's reflected in that guidance range. We do put in here for the first time Permian alone at 252,000 to 260,000 BOEs a day for that information.","The other items here are pretty much similar to where they've been in the past. I'll note two of them. One, we did lower our range for our DD&A going forward. That reflects the reserve adds that we added during 2017 at a low F&D cost. So that will continue to drive down our depletion rate.","And then lastly, on the effective tax rate, you can see here 21% to 25%, really reflecting the new tax change that became effective January 1, 2018. And really that tax, while not only was it great for corporate America and the U.S. economy. But specifically for Pioneer, given our extensive portfolio of drilling locations, it's a big uplift to our NAV as well.","So with that, why don't I stop there and we'll open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take your first question from Dave Kistler from Simmons Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning, guys, impressive results, and thanks for the added color on the 10-year plan. Looking specifically at slides 8 and 9, with your production growth trajectory outlined, the climbing cash flow, breakeven oil prices, and total cost structure, free cash flow looks to expand pretty substantially even at the forward strip, which is backwardated. Given the shareholder-friendly actions that you guys have initiated today, is that basically trying to provide incremental line of sight to us in terms of how that cash flow or free cash flow will expand? And as free cash flow is generated, should we expect it to be returned to shareholders?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Dave. First of all, as I mentioned in the call, we've taken a first step towards returning cash to shareholders here by virtue of increasing the dividend and announcing this share repurchase program regarding basically buying back creep from long-term incentive plan shares that are granted to employees for compensation.","What we'll do in the face of what you commented on is evaluate that situation over time. It's very clear if you look at the modeling associated with this that we should be generating very substantial free cash flow, seriously in billions of dollars over the plan period, and that's based on a $55 and $3 case.","So we'll be evaluating that through time. And as we head towards a free cash flow generation model, hopefully it's this year. It very well may be next year, of course, with the volatility in commodity prices. We'll make the next set of decisions at the board level. But for the time being, we believe we're taking a good first step, and then we'll be evaluating that as we go forward.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","I appreciate that color. And then looking at your details on the operating cost structure at about $19 a barrel in the Permian, obviously attractive as it stands right now. But can you talk about the additional levers or initiatives to drive that lower as part of the 10-year plan? It doesn't look like it's factored in to go lower yet, but I suspect with the infrastructure investments, et cetera, it should be positioned that way. Am I thinking about that the right way?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think that's right. I think there are a couple of angles there. One is, as was mentioned, we'll have completed about 65% of our infrastructure build-out by the end of 2018. With the 35% remaining over a few more years, you ought to see us then begin to reduce how much we spend from an infrastructure standpoint. We have baked into our planning about $300 million a year of infrastructure build-outs in that 10-year model. That very well may prove to be too high, but we want to be conservative in that way.","Secondly, what we haven't baked in at all is any sort of improvement from the standpoint of productivity gains and innovation benefits, technology improvement. Those should serve to reduce costs at the D&C line item, and I think also potentially in production cost and G&A as we head more towards the utilization of new technology and innovation.","But even probably more importantly is the fact that as we increase the productivity per well, in other words, as we continue to unlock the secrets to improving completion technology, to optimize the field operations, then you're improving on the BOE line item. When you're all done with all that, you should see improvement from these levels. And so we're not baking that in, but it gives us more confidence that achieving our goals is doable.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Great, I appreciate the added color, guys. Thanks so much.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","We'll hear next from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Tim, I wanted to get your thoughts on just the macro picture \u2013 or micro picture in West Texas. Big oil, including Exxon, as it outlines some really ambitious growth targets from the Permian, I was just wondering if you could discuss some of the on-the-ground challenges that you think the industry and PXD will face just given your long-term growth profile, which you did raise despite the asset sales.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thanks, Arun. I think first of all, we're encouraged to see companies like Exxon and Chevron talk about the long-term perspective of their growth rates. And if you look at their data, their ambitions are not dissimilar from ours as to the amounts they want to grow and the doability of that. I think if you look at it from this standpoint that we're all going to be in a mode of growth, one of the critical current issues is to make sure we can man the frac fleets, man the rigs, so personnel needs are going to be significant.","That's why some of the companies are coming together to start this process of looking at Permian Basin infrastructure needs to be able to make sure we can support the drilling campaign going forward. And so we're working in a new group effort among CEOs called the Permian Strategic Partnership to do just that, to look at opportunities to support infrastructure build-out, to get the people we need, and to provide for the development of the basin over what's going to be decades of drilling.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you, got you. And just to that point, in terms of the future build-out of the vertical integration, how do you plan to invest between company-owned fleets and third-party fleets on a go-forward basis?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's a great question. I think we've really been the beneficiary through time of owning our own vertical integration when it comes to pumping fleets. And the reason I say that is, when times are really strong, as they were in 2010 through 2014, we quickly paid for all of our equipment investment when margins were 100%-plus. When margins have been lousy in the downturn, we've been able to keep active, which is one of the reasons to make sure we maintain our RPMs of the organization, but in doing so we keep our employees. And so we're ready to roll with our six or seven fleets in any given time coming out of the downturn, where others are scrambling to get people. So there's tremendous value in owning our own pumping fleet.","Now that said, we do use one outside fleet today, and the decisions going forward are surrounding just the basic buy-versus-lease decisions. We know if we own these fleets, we can control our own destiny, we can control the costs, and we can make sure that they're there when we need them there. But there are a lot of great companies that are pumping wells as well. ProPetro has done a fantastic job for us as a third-party provider. And so that would be the model example of someone we might want to bring in as more third-party fleets.","This is in the fullness of time something we'll have to evaluate. In our case, we have two fleets that we're considering revamping and renovating that would put us up to nine fleets. That would certainly take care of us for the next year or two. At that point in time, we've got some decisions to make.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And my final question, Tim, is this the LOE on the horizontals below $2 pretty differential versus your peers? Can you talk about what is driving that? Is it some of the investments you've made on the infrastructure side driving that LOE?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","LOE generally is not related to infrastructure as much as it is. The total costs in the LOE are generally going to be personnel. They're going to be electricity, and they're going to be chemicals and this kind of thing. So chemical costs certainly are something we're trying to drive down. Personnel costs probably have an increasing labor component just based on the tightness we've discussed earlier. Electricity in the state of Texas I think has been relatively cheap and probably will remain that way.","So I think the real productivity gains on an LOE per BOE basis is on the BOE side of the equation. And to the extent we make more prolific wells, and there's a certain fixed cost component of drilling them and completing them and then producing them, and labor would be an example, then we would have the opportunity to potentially reduce that.","One thing we're looking at, of course, is doing a lot more operations remotely in our field. And this involves remote telemetry and remote surveillance such that we don't have to have people running around every single well every single day. And that's going to reduce the body count when it comes to the total number of people we need as we move forward. So our field people that are really outstanding employees can work on actually improving field operations versus just driving with windshield time. So there are a lot of ways we can focus on it. I can assure you it's a big push internally.","Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","We'll hear next from John Freeman from Raymond James.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. When I look at the 3.0 completions, which continue to perform quite well and, Tim, you said it's something that you're basically going to evaluate midyear and then determine what to do from that point forward, I'm trying to get a sense of how much flexibility there is in the plan to adjust to a 3.0+. Is it really something that's more like a 2019 event? I just assume a lot of planning goes into the 2018 budget. So changing to a different completion design on the fly in the middle of the year, you might not be able to push it up too much in the back half of the year even if the results continue to look as strong as they have.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's a great question. I think, John, if you look at it, we're already prosecuting this plan now. So we should be seeing results beginning probably in the second quarter. So you're exactly right. Once we decide to pull the trigger, let's say if we were to add more 3.0+ style wells, really in a lot of cases, that involves acquisition of more sand, more water, making sure it's on time and in place and we have the right horsepower in place. So it could have some effect clearly on the second half results. It's just that we want to make sure we have a full set of data to make that decision. But you're exactly right I think when you say what would be the main focus when we seriously ramped up 3.0+? It would be 2019.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then just my follow-up question, you were able to reduce the percentage of the four-string casing designs. And if you could, just elaborate on what allows you all to do that, and then the outlook for potentially reducing the percentage of the four-string casing designs further from here.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","There are a lot of reasons that we actually have done that. First of all, we've done a lot of learning regarding the last six months or so about areas that we can use three-string casings. We've gone back to some of those areas and reevaluated the modified three-string design. And that's one thing I think you expect us to do, just improve and to understand where it is we can get away with three-string on the basis that it is cheaper.","But there are other factors too. One is, to the extent we use more of our produced water and there was more water reuse, which we're going to take that up to about 15% or 20% of our total water needs this year from 5% last year, that means we're taking water away from otherwise that which needs to be re-injected, which is half the battle. So we're looking in that direction.","The other thing we're doing is we're moving water away from active drilling areas, which has the same effect. And finally, we're going to be drilling this year five Ellenberger wells. These are deep disposal wells in certain of our more active areas so as to, again, reduce the impact of injecting water into the shallow formations that have caused us some issues in the first place. And so the reason we can go to 50% is we're taking various steps and initiatives to do so simply because it's in our economic interest to do just that.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, Tim, great quarter.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Your next caller, Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you add more specifics on the advantage that you're seeing from sourcing sand from local third-party mines versus expanding your Brady mine, and then what do you also see as the risks around that?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Sure, Brian. I think first of all, it's a little bit early days for us. We have signed our first contract. We'll be taking deliveries of our first Permian dune sand or Western sand, whatever you want to call it, probably in April.","Simply said, the advantages of that are associated with its proximity to the field, and in particular the fact that the relative cost of mining that sand simply because it's sitting on the ground there is substantially less than mining in the Brady area, where we basically have got to blast the sand and crush it. So it's just simply a matter of cost on the one hand.","The other thing to note is this is in principle mostly 100-mesh or 40-70-mesh sizes, in other words, relatively small grain sand. So we are in the process right now of testing in various pilot projects the finer mesh sands to make sure that we wouldn't have any degradation of well results. The current feeling internally is this would not be the case. The 40-70 and 100-mesh will work just as well as some of the coarser grades. But that is something we've got to be protective about.","Of course, the thing about it is there's going to be a lot of mines, it seems like, that are going to be put on production and such that we might have various different suppliers that would allow us to then, as was stated earlier, not proceed with the expansion of Brady to the extent that's a substantial amount of capital we'd rather put into wells. And so I think the main objective is to go through the technical work, make sure that we in fact can lock in low-cost sand. We may be able to reduce our sand cost by 20% by doing this, so there's a substantial carrot our there for us to prosecute on this point.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And then you talked a little bit earlier just on some of the labor issues surrounding the broader Permian area. Can you just talk about the risks and inflationary pressures? And maybe it's not this year if your plan was already in place, but do you see that as a major issue, minor issue, or no issue as you think about 2019-2020 and the growth profile over 10 years?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think first of all, the labor issue today is exacerbated by the fact that we had the hurricanes and the needs for the repairs in both Houston area as well as Florida as well as was what's a relatively low unemployment rate in the United States and certainly in the Southwest, and particularly in the Midland-Odessa area. Accordingly, one of the near-term effects I think will be inflationary in the sense that we're estimating labor costs up probably in the neighborhood of 10% this year compared to last year, so that's more of a short-term issue.","The longer-term issues are associated with bringing in a workforce which is ready to work. And what I mean by that is, since we've gone through two downturns essentially in the last nine years, we've got to bring in a new style of employee, and in this case hopefully new technologically advanced employees who are ready to work in the new model. And they're going to need training. They're going to need safety training, for example. They're going to need operational training. And we're going to have to build basically a new style of workforce out of the fact that we've sent two groups of people home in the last eight, nine years. So we have a new style of employee coming in.","So it's going to behoove the companies, notwithstanding Pioneer, to make sure we provide infrastructure and the opportunities associated with Midland and Odessa being outstanding places to live and work.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thanks. Just following on some of the questions around the long-term outlook, I guess if I'm thinking about the 2018 program, you've said that you'll provide some free cash flow at the current strip. So if I run sensitivities off that and look at the breakeven you're talking about in 2020 seems to imply couple hundred million dollars of free cash flow, but by 2026, given some prior comments around rigs, potentially upwards of a couple billion dollars a year of free cash flow given a low 60s type rig count in 2026. Is that a fair way to think about it? And is it a linear, I guess, progression at $55 and $3 from 2020 to 2026 as we think about free cash flow?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I would just summarize the answer to your question being our modeling looks similar to yours.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, that's good to hear.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Congratulations I guess.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","That's easier than I anticipated. And then thinking about the Wolfcamp D, how are we thinking about well cost differences there? Sorry if I missed it, but I didn't think I saw that in the slides.","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, Michael, the Wolfcamp D wells are obviously more expensive because we only just recently drilled them. We're still looking at what the drilling costs are. And of course, as the drilling is more difficult, so is the completions. But the good thing that I can tell you is that in this last run, because we have had so much success in drilling and progressing our drilling, that the Wolfcamp D wells have been a non-issue in regards to drilling. We've been able to successfully execute those. But because we've only got a benchmark of one, we haven't really established what that cost looks like. But it'll just be slightly more expensive than what you would see with the Wolfcamp B well.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yeah, the way to think about it, Michael, is it's just deeper. So yeah, by definition it's going to be slightly more expensive.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Right, okay. Any completion challenges that come with that depth and I assume higher pressure?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Certainly with deeper is more pressure and with that, it does require a little bit more horsepower. And what I can tell you is we successfully deployed the completion on the first well, and we'll be doing the next three wells here in the next month or so.","We learned a few things on that first one that we'll be deploying on the second one, but our long-term outlook is that we don't foresee any challenges associated with those wells. You just work your way through it like we have everything else. And we'll hit our stride on it shortly, and we see Wolfcamp D being a big part of our program going forward.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. And then I guess as I think on the Wolfcamp D, you said 60% of the acreage was in the fairway. What are key attributes of what's defining the fairway for the Wolfcamp D from you all's perspective?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well, of course, we have, just like we prosecute every single zone, substantial data on the Wolfcamp D from a geologic perspective. And so it's exactly the same parameters that are evaluated to assess the prospectivity of the Wolfcamp D as we used with the Wolfcamp B, for example. So it's things like the hydrocarbons in place. It has to do with porosity. It has to do with the lack of clay content. It has to do with pressure and so on.","So what we do is a Venn diagram to assess all of those parameters, and that leads you to where you have the most prospectivity, and so therefore, and thermal maturity would be another example of that. There's about eight different to 10 different geologic parameters we use. And because we have such prolific data in the basin, we can actually pinpoint where it is this prospectivity is going to be actually before we even drill wells. And that gives us a huge advantage moving forward for optimization.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","All right, great. Appreciate the time.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question will come from Scott Hanold from RBC Markets.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my call and question. Can I ask? You obviously talked about asset monetizations in effectively everything but the Permian. And could you just give a sense, when those proceeds do come through, how do you think about allocating those when you look at incremental drilling and other shareholder type initiatives?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Well certainly, this is a bigger question for us long term as opposed to just associated with the asset divestitures because, as has been earlier mentioned by Michael, we have a substantial amount of free cash flow generated in the longer-term model. And so I think we have to evaluate all those levers.","If you look at what we've said in the past regarding the model and the 10-year vision, the last thing we want to do is accelerate faster than makes sense. And by making sense, I mean that which the organization can operate efficiently at on the one hand, but that secondly, to make sure the margins are intact. Last thing we want to do is in the face of an inflationary market situation be revving up and having reduced returns or diminishing returns.","And so that will always be something that's a possibility to tweak the RPMs of the engine up a little bit faster as to drilling. But we'll have to temper that with the notion we don't want to impact negatively our returns. And as I already mentioned, one alternative we've already moved ahead on is the first step regarding returning cash to shareholders. As has been stated many times, that is something we'll be evaluating and particularly when we do get to a free cash flow generation model.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, all right. Thanks for that. And with regards to a lot of the testing you're doing, can you just give a sense of what is the goal and when do you think you can achieve that by? So for example, is it to figure out effectively how this is going to look in full development and that's what you're targeting, and when do you think you could have that in? And one last part of this long question, how come the Wolfcamp C is not part of the delineation and testing process?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","First of all, we've done a lot of work, as you know, through the years now. It seems to be a short time, but it's really years of developing our knowledge of the Wolfcamp B, the Wolfcamp A in terms of how that drilling campaign is laid out, and less in the Spraberry zone.","So Joey talked about this. But over the next few years, there's no reason to think that the Middle and Lower Spraberry and the Jo Mill in combination, referred to as the Spraberry zones, wouldn't be a significant contributor to our growth. But we want to make sure we do the proper work in terms of sequencing and stacking, spacing, and so on that allows us to have confidence that we're optimizing the development of those. So that's in fact exactly what we're doing right now. 2018 is a very important year as we look at those series of pads to evaluate those exact questions.","So those are what we referred to on Joey's slides as one of the sets of appraisals we're doing. So once the appraisals are done, we understand what's optimal in certain areas, then we head off into more of a development scenario. So you'll notice it on his slides, he actually has several areas where we're in appraisal. And in particular, they are those three zones, but also we have the Clearfork zone. This is our first well, so we're far from development of the Clearfork.","And Wolfcamp D, we mentioned really an outstanding well, but then three more utilizing the higher-intensity completions this year. So we're not really ready to head off to development of Wolfcamp B, although that may be something that is a product of the drilling campaign.","Finally, on Wolfcamp C, it's I think very prospective for us. I think if you look at the work Parsley has done down there, essentially the Reagan Upton line, those are some excellent wells, and they set up and basically prove out 900 Pioneer locations in the Wolfcamp C. It's just that they're down the seriatim of well, we got a bunch of other things to achieve at once. So we eventually will get to Wolfcamp C development drilling. We're very happy Parsley is drilling some wells in there so we can learn from them. So that's the way I look at it as how it's set up for the future.","Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. I appreciate that, thanks.","Operator","We'll move next to Bob Brackett from Bernstein.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","To follow up on this popular Wolfcamp D appraisal topic, are those three appraisals coming this year? Are they offsets to the Shackleford, or are you testing other counties or regions?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, they're down in Reagan County, so they're further south.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All three of them are in Reagan?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","Yes, that's a three-well pad.","Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Matt Portillo from TPH.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up question around capital allocation and the balance sheet, obviously a lot of conversation this morning around free cash generation, but curious to hear your thoughts on your business model moving forward and the use of the balance sheet and how you think about the appropriate leverage metrics as you think about your business model long term, given that you start to move into a net cash position with the free cash generation?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I think the main objective we've had through time is to have a pristine balance sheet. I think it's clear that we have that today. I think you have to look at this in connection with the fact it's hard for us, and maybe it's the case we've been proven to be not very good forecasters of future oil prices. We can't preclude the possibility of lower oil prices than rigs than we're achieving today. And so we always want to make sure that our balance sheet is prepared for that eventuality.","The long-term model has us from that standpoint in pretty good positioning because if at times we can generate free cash flow because prices are in excess of $55, then we can hoard that cash and\/or do shareholder-friendly things. To the extent prices are below $55, we can utilize the balance sheet to make sure we can drill through the downturn.","I think the last thing we want to do is to have a situation where we have a downturn, and I'm sure there will be one someday again where we then don't drill because then in essence you're missing the opportunity to drill wells at the cheapest costs that you'll ever achieve, which is what we proved in this last downturn.","And so we want to make sure the balance sheet is in good stead for all the ups and downs. And so I think from that standpoint, our main objective will be to always keep an exceptionally strong balance sheet.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you very much, and just a follow-up question around your midstream infrastructure. You've built an extremely valuable asset base here over the last few years and continue to invest in that business going forward. How do you think about the vertical integration of midstream assets within your business model and the ownership of some of the assets, particularly around gas processing, as you progress into 2019 and beyond?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","That's a great question because we have a wealth of value created by our water business, our gas processing business, our sand business, and our pumping services business, just because of what they allow us to achieve.","But the fact is the reason we do those ourselves is because we want to make sure we have the ability to execute on our plan. And so for the time being, what that means, if you use gas processing as an example, we want to invest in new plants with our partner, Target, to make sure the plants are there on time and ready to take new gas supply, considering gas volumes are considerable in the Permian Basin and growing. And so to the extent we're an equity owner in that system, we can have a positive influence, we feel like, in dealing with our partner to make sure that we get these plants there in time for our production.","Similarly, in our water business, our water business in the fullness of time, once we have it all fully constructed and sourcing Midland water, will be saving us some $500,000 per well. So at some point in time, we might consider some change of ownership. For the time being, we're building out the system. We're making sure we have water as we prosecute our system. Eventually, we may be even further into water sales, as an example. But the fact is we want to build this out and make sure we can execute. At that point in time, we'll evaluate other alternatives considering the value that we've already added.","Matthew Merrel Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. My first question is will selling your Eagle Ford assets create any reduction of Pioneer's export volume potential in 2018?","J.D. Hall - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","No, because we're not really exporting condensate today and so I don't anticipate it changing. The volumes that you see on our slide that we presented are all Permian Basin ones, so I don't see any change.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. If it proves successful, I know it's early. But if it proves successful, how repeatable do you imagine the Clearfork might be in your northern acreage? The Clearfork has had a historical reputation for having heterogeneous geology.","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","I'm not a geologist, so fortunately I'm not going to be able to answer that question. I can get you an answer from our geo team. But I think when you look at it, we would just simply say let us get a well drilled. We'll evaluate it in connection with the rest of our geologic data, and then we'll come at with a view on that point.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, that's fair enough. And then my last question was with regard to the co-producing of the Jo Mill and the Spraberry that you're testing. At this point in time, does this look like it's going to be more of a sweet spot deal, or does this look like it could be something that can cover \u2013 you have a very large aerial extent of Jo Mill tests that you show on slide 13. Is this potentially available to that entire area that you show?","Timothy L. Dove - Pioneer Natural Resources Co.","So if you look at the geologic data across the basin, what you will find is, especially in the northern acreage, the Jo Mill and the Lower and Middle Spraberry zones are ubiquitous across the entire acreage position. Now of course, just like everything else, there are certain areas that are slightly better than others. So our objective is going to be to start optimizing around where to place these pads that are reaching out and touching all three zones. But I can tell you it's a wide swath of acreage just because each of those zones is, in fact, ubiquitous across the entire northern acreage, less opportunity probably to the south in the Wolfcamp, the southern Wolfcamp area.","And the reason we can tell you that is because it's the case that essentially every single vertical well that were drilled in the last 5 to 10 years prior to the horizontal campaign were in fact completed in the Spraberry zones and the Jo Mill. So we have a virtual complete data set to be able to answer that question.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Thanks, Lori. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be the first speaker. He's going to provide the financial and operating highlights for the fourth quarter of 2015. Another quarter which saw the company deliver strong execution and performance. Scott will then review our plans for 2016 in the face of the continuing weak commodity price environment.","After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. He'll also provide more details regarding the 2016 Spraberry\/Wolfcamp drilling program. Rich will then cover the fourth quarter financials and provide earnings guidance for the first quarter. And after that, we will open up the call for your questions. So, Scott, I will turn the call over to you at this time.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide number 3 on our operating and financial highlights. We had a fourth quarter adjusted loss of 27 million, or $0.18 per share. Fourth quarter production, 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 53% oil. The top end of our revised guidance of 213 to 215. That's an increase of about 4,000 barrels a day, or 2% versus the prior quarter. Full year production, 204,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 52% oil versus 48%, in 2014. That's an increase of 22,000 barrels a day, or 12%, versus 14%. Oil production was up 18,000 barrels a day, or 21%, versus 2014. Obviously, the growth driven primarily by the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program in the Midland Basin.","Also, we delivered 273% drill bit reserve replacement of 210 million barrels of oil equivalent, at a drill bit fine F&D cost of about $10 per BOE. Again, shows you the true prolific nature of the Midland Basin and Wolfcamp, with average operating cost of a typical Wolfcamp well of $5 and fining cost of about $10. It still shows it's very economical in today's environment to still be drilling in this place.","Slide number 4. We did place horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp during the fourth quarter. As expected, early production from 35 wells in the North and 9 wells in the South is exceeding expectations, as we had mentioned earlier in January, primarily due to the company's completion optimization program. Also, continuing to strive toward great capital efficiency gains in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, really driven by service cost reductions, efficiency gains and completion optimization programs. We did issue 500 million at 3.5% senior notes, due 2021, and 500 million at 4.5% senior notes due 2026, in December. To refund payment of our 2016 and 2017 maturities and that will be coming up over the next 12 months.","Working with midstream partners to have our oil export facilities along the gulf coast operational by mid-2016, we did see the first cargo go out recently, not but us, by another producer. It's the first WTI cargo I saw that went to the Caribbean and mixing with heavy Venezuelan crude. So people are starting to pay somewhat of a premium, so we hope we can get some crude out. The only crude that I've seen go out before that were a couple of the Eagle Ford Oil cargoes from Eagle Ford from two other operators. But what's most important for us is that the long term strip has narrowed to essentially nothing between Brent and WTI.","On number 5, our plan, obviously we've made a change since early January. The primary reason for that change is that the entire strip for 2016 has dropped over $10 during that timeframe. Much faster than I had thought, than we had thought at the management team, at the board level. So that's why we have developed this response to that. So we're reducing our horizontal drilling activity by 50%, from 24 rigs down to 12 by mid-2016 while still growing production by 10% plus and preserving the company's strong balance sheet and cash position.","Eagle Ford will be going from six rigs to zero during the first quarter. Two rigs already released. Also in Eagle Ford we will have 17 ducks that will hold off and decide when prices come back, which I expect in 2017, reducing Southern Wolfcamp joint venture from four rigs to zero by mid-2016. We'll be using the rest of our carry as the reason that we're running those rigs until mid-year to fully utilize the rest of the carry. Reducing northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp from 14 to 12, really for capital preservation. Already released one rig. We were going back and forth between 12 and 14. We felt like that we wanted to get our capital budget down about $2 billion, so there's nothing magic about it, but what's amazing is that we're still growing 50%, 10% plus by cutting half of our rigs. A great accomplishment to the Permian team.","Reallocating two Eagle Ford shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. Reduction in drilling activity in [indiscernible] spending results and capital expenditures of about $2 billion for 2016. That's down from our preliminary forecast in early January from $2.4 to $2.6 billion and from actual spending in 2015 of 2.2. That's 1.85 for drilling. That does include tank batteries, SWD, saltwater disposal wells and gas processing facilities. And then an additional $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrade and fill facilities.","Slide number 6. A continuation of our plan. We are probably the best hedged company in regard to oil again for 2016. We do have 20% for 2017. And we do have great gas coverage, 70% for 2016.","Again, we have a great balance sheet, probably the best in the industry today. When you look at our $500 million coming due from enterprise and look at $400 million of cash on the balance sheet with additional $1.6 billion from our recent equity offering, we essentially have zero debt today. So obviously the best balance sheet among any major and any independent in the marketplace. And that's one of the reasons we decided to grow 10% plus and preserve roughly about $1.7 billion going into 2017. And if prices recover mid-2016, if they recover late 2016, if they recover early 2017, we have tremendous firepower to start up faster than anybody else and get back to our 15% growth profile over the next several years.","Slide number 7. On drilling completions capital, capital program again of $2 billion, $1.85 billion of drilling completion. As you can see, 90% of it's in the north. I won't go over the detail here, but any questions, please give Frank and Mike in the group calls afterwards. Other capital of $150 million and, again, the capital program funding from our cash flow. Plus using a combination of our enterprise funds of $500 million coming mid-year, and $400 million in cash that we had at the end of the year in late 2015.","Slide number 8. Looking at going forward, you can see that we are growing 10% plus. I still think that number is going to lead any company with oil production of any major and independent in the U.S. marketplace. Again, we have the firepower to start it back up fairly quickly. We're looking at 224,000 barrels of oil a day-plus, for the year 2016, going from 52% oil to 56% oil. You can see most of the pickup will be in the second, third and fourth quarter, as we have given out guidance of about 211 to 216 for the fourth quarter. And again, long term, 2016 to 2018, we do show growth in this low strip price environment. 2017 will be again around 10%. Preserving over half of our cash of $1.7 billion by the end of 2017. And so, pioneer can essentially weather 2016 and 2017 without increasing debt, and be able to jump-start at any point in time over the next two years as prices recover.","I'm going to now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail about operations.","Tim Dove","Thanks, Scott. We continue to be very encouraged by the results of our drilling and completion program in the Midland Basin. I will start here on slide 9 talking about the northern area, where we put 22 Wolfcamp B wells on production during the fourth quarter. You can see the production profile in the chart below, as the dark blue lines represents those wells' early production. And it's very clear when you look at that, this is exceptionally strong production results we're seeing. The strongest to date in our program. And it's very clear that these wells are tracking well above that million barrel BOE type curve shown in the dash line.","We did also put two Wolfcamp A wells on production, right at the end of the year. Those are shown in the red line. Below on the grass, you can see there's very little production data. Current thinking is that we will be seeing more data as time goes on. But we're putting these wells on gas lift almost immediately. They had IP rates of about 1570 barrels per day. Of course, early in the life of these wells. We will be reporting more about that next quarter.","When you look at the performance of the wells from the third quarter, it's very clear we have similar results, in the sense if you're looking at the 28 B wells and 2 A wells shown on the graph. One in light blue and the other in orange, respectively. Once again, we have a limited data set on A wells, only 2, but they're performing exceptionally. Well over the million barrel type curve. And when you look at the third quarter B wells, they also performed exceptionally well. So, what you can also see from this graph is, we're improving quarter to quarter sequentially, in terms of the performance of these wells. And that has to do with a great extent related to our completion optimization program. About two-thirds of the wells in the third quarter were subject to completion optimization, and all of the fourth quarter wells were exposed to completion optimization. And so you can see the uplift we're generating as a result of optimizing these wells.","When I talk about optimization, it's several different factors that we're testing, in various different areas. For example, generally, we're changing the stage lengths from 240 feet to 150 feet. We're changing the clusters per stage generally from 4 to 5. We're pumping more fluid. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 36 barrels per foot, compared to the prior 30 barrels per foot. And, importantly, we've increased the sand concentrations for these wells in the fourth quarter up to about 1500 pounds per foot, from a total of about 1100 from prior completions.","We're going to outline a little bit later in the slide deck the expansion of some of these ideas even to further optimization in their 2016 campaign. I would say it's worth pointing out, if you look at the table below, that, of the 22 Wolfcamp B wells put on production, they average exceedingly strong IPs of 2200 barrels per day on a BOE basis, and that compares with 1900, in terms of the campaign from the third quarter. So, dramatic increases we continue to see as completion optimization is paying off very well.","Turning now to slide 10. We have seen similar successes in the lower Spraberry shale, where we popped 11 wells during the quarter. The early production results, as you can see on the graph, are close to that same one million barrel EUR type curve and we did the completion optimizations on 9 of the 11 wells, essentially using the exact same style of franc optimization and completion optimization that I mentioned regarding the Wolfcamp zones. The production on some of these wells is really continuing to build. In fact, only five out of these 11 wells have actually reached their IP rates. They're continuing to build not atypical for lower ratio wells as we take the water off the system, oil rates increase and peak quite a long ways into the early production life. So we'll be having more to report regarding these wells as we see their IPs and can incorporate that into the first quarter report.","Turning to slide 11, once again we're seeing strong results in the south with the JV area, the Wolfcamp. We're reusing essentially the same optimization techniques and we placed nine wells on production in the southern Wolfcamp area. Of the eight Wolfcamp B wells, you can see in the graphs below, particularly on the left blue line tracking above a million barrel type curve and the Wolfcamp A well that was drilled, one of the nine wells, showing the red curve on the right is tracking between 800,000 BOE and a million BOE in terms of its type curve. So these are very good wells in the south and you can see there's various areas of the south that are going to compete very well with the north. Again, all of these were optimized using similar optimization packages as we had discussed earlier in the prior slides.","Now then turning to slide 12. The optimization and productivity gains I have already mentioned are leading to a high level of capital efficiency. That's critical, of course, when we're faced with a low commodity price environment as we see today. You can see on our left graph here that we continue to see dramatic improvements when it comes to our drilling campaign and completion campaigns where we are dropping our costs dramatically sequentially from quarter to quarter. We've decreased our cost for D and C in the north B wells by an average of about 30% over the last year, which is really a phenomenal result. At that same time, as you see the curves on the right, we're seeing sequential increases in cumulative production per well as we go through time. That is reflected in the prior slides that I've already mentioned, but you can see it pretty dramatically here that on a 90-day average rate, our production is up from about 830 BOE per day in 2014's fourth quarter to 1250 in this last fourth quarter. And it's pretty clear, if you look at data, that IPs are well correlated to well EURs. And so you can see we've had a dramatic improvement as a result of our capital efficiency and optimization programs. So it does give us confidence that we are, in fact, increasing capital efficiency through time and that allows us to continue drilling today, albeit at a slower rate based on the commodity price deck.","Turning to slide 13. And this is now reflecting on the 2016 campaign for the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp D and C budget. Scott's already mentioned some of this, so I'll be brief. We are going to be moving to 12 rigs in the north, as he said, zero in the south, and expect in doing so to still place 230 wells on production this year, split 60% Wolfcamp B and the balance being Wolfcamp A and along with Spraberry shales, about 190 wells in the north and 40 in the south. And despite the fact we've had weak commodity prices, as I mentioned earlier, we are still generating good returns on the wells we're drilling. The optimization campaign is certainly helping that. Now what we're planning on doing in certain areas is actually furthering that optimization campaign. For example, in some areas actually reduce the cluster lengths to about 15 feet and 10 clusters per stage. We're looking at increasing the fluid utilization up to about 50 barrels per foot and increasing our sand concentrations up to 1700 to 2,000 pounds per foot.","At the same time we continue to experiment with less coarse sand concentration. so 40\/70 sand and 100 mesh sand. In doing so, we can put more of a focus on slick water fluid utilization versus gels. We're also in all these areas adjusting spacing and stacking as we learn more in each area. We're really still heavily in the process of learning the best way to complete the wells, and it's not the case, it's the same in every area for every zone. So we can learn a lot this year and it's one of the benefits of continuing a drilling campaign. Costs are coming in about 7.5 to $8 million, and that's based on a 9,000 foot lateral and incorporates the optimized completions costs. The program that we were talking about in terms of production growth, we're incorporating EURs in range, depending on the zone, from 800,000 BOE to about 1.2 million BOE, depending on which zone we're dealing with. And we have IRRs in this campaign. Current prices that are up to 30%. As Scott already mentioned, with our cost being low to develop this production and with operating costs being low, returns are very solid.","Turning now to slide 14. We continue to build out the required infrastructure, albeit at a slower rate of spending, based on what's going on with the price downturn. In terms of tank batteries and salt water disposal facilities, we will spend about $170 million this year. In doing so, we're reducing our cost per well that's hooked up and put on production, from about $900,000 to about $750,000 this year. That's a benefit of the scales coming from the fact of our prior spending on centralization of the facilities. And so, we're beginning to see the benefits that come from pre-planning and pre-spending, in the form of reduced cost too hook wells up.","We will spend about $45 million in gas processing. The most important part of that is completing the Buffalo plant in Martin county, in the second quarter of this year. There are no new plants after that in the foreseeable future. We did announce the start-up of a 20 mile pipeline to deliver effluent water, non-potable water from the city of Odessa to some of our Midland County drilling locations, and that's going to save us a tremendous sum. Calculated $100,000 per well once this water starts being utilized. It just started flowing last week. We'll also spend about $45 million or so when it comes to mainline expansions in other subsystems. And just like the Odessa deal, we continue to pursue purchasing, from the city of Midland, effluent water. In a similar way, those negotiations continue.","Finally, on this slide, the completion of the expansion on the [indiscernible] has been postponed, as you might expect, until we're at a point where we're going to be adding more rigs.","Turning to slide 15. We certainly have begun to see the effects of the strong well results I showed, in the form of production. If you look at the production in the fourth quarter, actually reaching the top end of our revised range, that's emblematic of the fact that we put the number of wells on production we had planned, which was about 44 horizontal wells. But only way you can explain the fact that we're outperforming, is these wells have very strong IP rates, as I showed on prior slides. And so, that gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. The horizontal production actually makes up more than half of our total production today, in this basin, about 60%.","We see production growing in the basin here about 30%. That's after a great year in 2015, at 27%, by putting those 230 wells on production. The first quarter production volumes are forecasted to be somewhat flat, and they're impacted by the fact that we have a great deal of expected shut-in volumes. The fact that we have offset fracs being three times greater than occurred in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter. And the reason for that is, we're popping these wells. We're fracking the wells near existing pads. The objective is, of course, to save infrastructure costs. Whereas, the second quarter should be a strong quarter for production. And we'll expect to pop a similar number of wells in the first quarter, as we did in the fourth quarter, about 45 wells.","So, I will sum it up by saying, these operating results give us a lot of confidence that the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp assets can perform well, even in a depressed commodity price environment. Which means, we're poised to accelerate development of these assets when prices improve.","And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Rich for a review of the fourth quarter financials and his outlook for the first quarter.","Rich Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on slide 16, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $623 million, or $4.17. That did include non-cash mark-to-market derivative losses of $13 million after tax, or $0.09. And it had two unusual items there, both of which we mentioned in our January guidance that we provided. An impairment on Eagle Ford Shale approved properties non-cash of about $542 million after tax, or $3.63, primarily as a result of the reduction in commodity prices. And we had other non-cash impairments, mainly vertical pipe inventory that we're not using because we're out of the vertical drilling business, of about $41 million, or $0.27. So, adjusting for those items, as Scott mentioned, we had a loss of $27 million adjusted or $0.18.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show how we performed against the updated guidance that we gave in January in conjunction with the equity offering, you can see that all the items came in where we would have expected within guidance around the positive side of guidance. The one item I'll make note of is our current income tax provision. We had a benefit of $26 million. That was really the result of a tax law that changed that happened in December where they allowed bonus depreciation. which had the effect of reducing our 2015 estimate of alternative minimum tax, and so we did recognize that benefit.","Turning to slide 17, looking at commodity prices, as you guys are well aware, they were down again in the fourth quarter where you see on our bar charts that oil was down 11% to $37.92, NGL was down 2% to $12.16 per barrel and gas prices were down 20% to $2.03. At the bottom of the slide you can see the benefit of our derivative positions in the fourth quarter. Once again, adding significant cash to the company. Because of that position, we added about $281 million of cash flow in the Q4 related at our derivative position and about $875 million for the year. As we look forward, Scott mentioned we're 85% hedged in 2016 and 70% on gas. And that derivative portfolio at year end was valued at roughly $750 million. With what's happened to prices since year end, it's well over $800 million today.","Turning to slide 18 and production costs. A continuation of improvement here where our production costs for the quarter were $11.02, down about 5% from the third quarter. If you look at base LOE, it was also the main contributor where it was down 5% quarter-on-quarter. But probably more impressive is it was down 22% relative to the 2014 average. And so most of that is really just the company's cost reduction initiatives throughout the year.","Turning to slide 19 and our balance sheet in just a little bit more detail. At the end of the year, we had net debt of $2.3 million. As Scott mentioned, we're probably in the position of the best balance sheet in the industry today. If you take into account the equity offering of $1.6 billion of proceeds, the incremental $500 million of proceeds from the EFS midstream sale that we'll get midyear, our net debt is basically $200 million at the end of the year. If you look at the maturity schedule there, you can see the 2016 and 2017 maturities. Those are the ones that we pre-funded back in December on the chart here, the 2021 proceeds and the 2026. Probably the important thing here is that we reduced our interest rate as we pay those off in order of magnitude of 2% in each of those cases. So, overall, the company with cash on the balance sheet, taking care of our near term maturities, the equity offering, undrawn credit facility, we have a great liquidity position as we move into 2016 and 2017.","Turning to slide 20. Looking at first quarter guidance. Daily production 211,000 to 216,000 BOEs a day. As Tim mentioned, that does reflect the higher shut in volumes due to offset fracs as we're completing wells near existing infrastructure that have wells already connected to it. Production cost down slightly just to reflect our cost reduction initiatives to $10.50 per BOE to $12.50 per BOE. Other one worth noting is DD&A $18.50 per BOE to $20.50. Generally, you would probably expect that to be down a little bit more, given the impairment charge. But I think it's important to note that our approved reserves that we calculate at the end of each quarter reflect a trailing 12 month average prices. As you're aware, prices continue to fall and so that 12 month average will come down, which will affect our end of life reserves that will become uneconomic a little sooner. So I think that offsets to a certain extent the impairment charge related to Eagle Ford.","Interest expense. Higher just reflecting the new bonds that are in there. Once we pay off the 16th and 17th that will drop back down to the levels we've seen in past quarters. On other expense, $70 to $80 million. That is up. It comprised of three big components in there are $20 to $25 million of stacked drilling rig charges that we expect in the first quarter as a result of our rig reduction activities. We also have about $20 to $25 million of unused transportation and gathering commitments in there, and then lastly, about $20 million related to the third party component of our pressure pumping business that we recognized a loss on that's principally non-cash due to depreciation, basing it on a cash basis where we're break even. The other items here are consistent to what we've had in prior quarters so I won't go into those.","So with that, why don't we stop there and we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we'll go first to Brian Singer at Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott Sheffield","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","You highlighted the strip coming down $10 as why you pulled back just a bit here on the CAPEX. Can you talk more specifically on what oil price you need to see to bring activity back to 18 rigs? Whether the six rigs would go back to the areas from where they originally were? And then what oil price you need to see to bring back officially that long term growth guidance of 15% total and 20% for oil?","Scott Sheffield","Brian, I think if you take away this year and you just look at the strip from 2017 going forward, obviously we'd be bringing back rigs. I think this year we're going to see weakness over the next three to four to five months. It's probably going to stay in the 20s and then it's going to start bouncing back up as we see five, six, 700,000 a day of U.S. shale decline. And so I'm encouraged of somewhere between 40 and 50 for 2017. That will allow us to start back up more rigs. Longer term, I think if we get out of the 40s and get back to 50 plus that you can see us with a strip and continuing in Contango going up from there, I think we can easily get back to the 15% plus range.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Appreciate that. And then also we appreciate the color on what you're doing on the completion optimization front. And just putting a few things you said, your Wolfcamp wells are outperforming your type curve, your Spraberry wells are, too. And then you're increasing your completion optimizations in 2016. The question would be what would you need to see to take up your guidance further for EURs versus the 0.8 to 1.2 and then BOE that you highlight? Or is there some positive impact from high grading that you're seeing relative to the average of well locations that remain?","Tim Dove","Yeah, Ryan, this is Tim. I don't think high grading is really a factor because we're drilling in all of our eight subset areas with rigs as we speak. And the whole objective there is to continue learning. I guess I would focus on the fact that that's exactly what we're doing in 2016 is focusing on understanding the completion optimization by area by zone. And I can tell you, it's not a cookie cutter approach. All these rocks take different fracs, different ways. And so that's why we're a little hesitant to say definitively we have it all figured out because it's going to take a lot more time. And as I said on the call, we only have limited data set really on the Wolfcamp A, as an example. And for that matter, relatively limited data set on Spraberry shale. So I think what you'll see us due in the fullness of time is be able to show you more data by area by zone, and I think we can land on where we think the ultimate sort of positioning should be vis-a-vis those curves when that happens. We just need a little bit more time in the lab to understand exactly what these wells can do.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Evan Calio at Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","Good morning, guys.","Scott Sheffield","Good morning.","Evan Calio","You discussed moving -- you'd adjust the rate count and then moving a pair of completion crews from Eagle Ford to Midland. How many crews are you running in 2016? I'm just trying to understand your view of the growth trajectory in 2016, given Q1's guidance, which I know reflects some shut ins.","Tim Dove","Yeah, Evan, this is Tim again. Right now by moving two fleets, which we're in the process of doing right now, we'll have eight fleets running. And that'll be the beginning point. It's possible we could reduce the number of fleets running as we get into the second half of the year and be able to achieve exactly the same amount of results. But right now we'll be running eight, essentially through the first half of the year.","Evan Calio","And is there any discretionary -- do you see builder draw in 2016 in Midland?.","Tim Dove","Could you repeat the question one more time?","Evan Calio","Sorry. I didn't know. Is there a discretionary DUC build or draw in your 2016 guidance?","Tim Dove","Oh, yeah. I didn't understand you. Sorry. Yeah, we're not ducking any wells in the Permian. We're just going to be continuously completing the wells there with our fleets. And so you will not see any ducks in Midland basin.","Evan Calio","Great. And lastly, if I could, just maybe on the flip-side or the other side of Brian's first question. I know that you guys have significantly more flexibility than peers, but where would you decrease your activity as you move into 2017. Any kind of price sensitivities there would be appreciated.","Scott Sheffield","Obviously, if we stay sub 30 for the next six or nine months, we're going to have to reduce activity. But if we stay sub 30, no OPEC action, not much production decrease in the strip. And if going into 2017 drops way below 40, then we're going to have to reduce activity.","Evan Calio","Okay guys. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Tim, looking at the slide, I think it's on slide 13, it pointed to 1.2. The comment that goes along with that is I add ours up to 30% at current strip. So what's the variability and why would you be continuing to drill the lower end of that, assuming that you're not going to raise it at some point? Because I'm guessing that the frilly loaded returns are going to be level at 30. Can you just elaborate on that a little bit? And I've got a follow-up, please.","Tim Dove","Well, as you look at, Doug, the range of data that we're talking about from the standpoint of what these zones have been able to accomplish, we have a range that's actually 800,000 up to 1.2 and probably higher.","To the extent we're drilling Wolfcamp A intervals, I mentioned on the call that we're -- this is in the south I'm talking about. But obviously be limiting the number of wells in the south, but our southern Wolfcamp A wells actually do range from 800,000 to a million BOE. That's why we have the range down that far. They'll be a very limited number of those wells drilled, however. So the vast majority of wells that will be drilled will be million barrel to 1.2 or higher. So the reason we put the range in there simply is to make sure that we can cover all the different angles in the different zones. But I can assure you that our focus will be on the Wolfcamp B, as I mentioned, and the Wolfcamp A, and to a lesser extent, lower Spraberry shale. But all of those, as shown on the prior graphs, are well exceeding one million BOEs in most cases. And so we do try to be conservative on this. The returns, I think, are roughly in that 30% range today, based on strip prices. There's some numbers slightly above and slightly below, but that's kind of the way we look at it from the standpoint of 1 to 1.2 million barrel type curves.","Doug Leggate","Okay, thanks for that. My follow-up, really two parts to it, I guess. First of all, to come back to Scott's comment about if oil prices stay depressed, you have an extremely valuable hedge book and one with a margin that if you took the view of $26 as getting as close as perhaps any of us could have predicted. At what point, to the extent you're only down two, does the hedge become a source of funds? You know that you need it, but just in terms of maximizing value of that hedge book. . My related follow-up, I guess, is given the slowdown in activity, it seems [indiscernible] values are still holding up relatively well considering the collapse in the commodity. So obviously you're not going to get to any recourse to your inventory in any reasonable timeline, so where did you see the potential for liquidation? Again, knowing that you don't need the money, but in terms of how you maximize volume.","Rich Dealy","Yeah, Doug, the problem is we may look at it one month at a time, but the problem, as you know, operating costs around the world in most assets are lower than $26. So that's why I think a lot of people are saying it's going to go lower before it goes higher. So we actually have to see people start shutting in production. So I'm afraid it may go lower. So why unwind at 26, first question. Secondly, it's in Contango, and so it's not a flat 26 over the next 12 months. If it was a flat 26, we may have more of a tendency to unwind. But right now we have no plans to unwind our hedge fund.","Scott Sheffield","Acreage values?","Rich Dealy","Oh, acreage values, yeah, they're still running 20,000 plus in the Permian. That's always an option for us as we have pointed out in the time, to sell some of our acreage at some point in time if we need cash. Obviously, with already $2.5 billion in cash on hand, we don't need the cash but that's always a great luxury for the company to sell part of our acreage over time to fund growth. So it's an option. We're just not going to do anything today.","Doug Leggate","Thanks guys. Is there still an active market on the buy side? I mean, is there still active buyers in your mind?","Rich Dealy","It's the people that are -- they buy. I won't say any names, but they buy, go to the equity markets and deleverage. And they're doing it successfully. And then there's some private equity money out there that's paying $20,000 plus an acre too, successfully. You can see the returns are good. They're still as Tim said, up to 30%. And so, you can sit there and pay 20,000 an acre, and you're not going to get a 30% return because most of our acreage is, essentially, zero basis. So you have got build that in. And so, they're probably only getting 10, 15% returns, and they're hoping for a better price tag. But there's still some deals being done in that.","Doug Leggate","All right. Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Neal Dingmann, at SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Morning gentlemen. Scott, could you give maybe some color on your thoughts about, obviously you still have massive acreage in Eagle Ford. Just if you could talk about maybe costs over there, or would you consider parting with some of that acreage, given you're obviously taking activity away from that?","Scott Sheffield","Of course, our activity is down zero here shortly. And we're going to have to wait until prices get back into the mid to high 40s before we start back up again. And so, it may be a while. And so, all of our acreage is held by production. And so, in today's market, I don't think you will see anybody be trading Eagle Ford production or acreage just because the prices are too low. You got to have some type of recovery, in my opinion, over the next two years, before people start moving Eagle Ford acreage and values.","Neal Dingmann","Got it. Got it. And then, you mentioned about the stack and gathering charges just for the first quarter. Is that, if you continue with this rig rate, will you continue to have approximately those type of charges going forward? How should we think about those costs going forward?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, I think for 2016, they're going to be generally in that range, and they will come down significantly as we move into 2017 and 2018.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. And then, just lastly, I think you hit this Scott, but I think Doug maybe asked about sort of the all-in costs and the returns. How do you look at it, as far as deriving some of your returns on a cash cost versus your all-in cost? I mean, is it as long as you're achieving ahead of those cash costs, you're certainly going to keep drilling or maybe even accelerate? Or is it more based against an all-in cost or return? How do you think about that?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, the returns that Tim was quoting, well, first of all, it includes all SWD, all-in costs at the least. So it includes SWDs, it includes any seismic, it includes acreage cost, which was generally very minimal. It does not include our G&A and interest. And so, G&A and interest brings those down to probably 10% to 15% type returns.","Neal Dingmann","Now that makes sense. Okay, thanks for all the details, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question today from Jon Wolff, at Jefferies. Sir?","Jon Wolff","Good morning. Good morning. Noticing that Mid-Cush differentials have been pretty flat and, at times, at premiums. One story I heard was that, with all the new pipe setting East, the refiners were quite interested in Permian crude, due to its straight run characteristics for gasoline and diesel. And the other piece was that some of the pipes weren't quite full and were kind of looking for volume. So that was putting in bids. Can you talk a little bit about Mid-Cush diffs?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah. I think as it relates to us, Jon, we have most of our crude going to the Gulf Coast on one pipeline or another. We're seeing definitely interest in the market over there for WTI, but we're not seeing any, even though the export bans been lifted, any significant premium. So, I think for the time being, with the spread just got talked about coming back between WTI, there's not a big differentiation today, but, longer term, we think that will be a benefit to have our crude on the Gulf Coast and have options to move it down to South America or to Europe, over time.","Jon Wolff","All right. I guess the other point is the pipelines not being full. is that a testament to the basin having maybe slowed a little bit? Volume growth has stalled a little bit for the basin, as a whole. Or is it more just the demand center, the demand pull?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, I think the growth has still slowed some. But I think it was just the case that more pipes were built on the view that growth was going to continue before the price fall. So I think there's extra capacity today and, hopefully, when prices rebound, the basin will be the first to pick up in the U.S., and those pipelines will start getting filled again.","Rich Dealy","Jon, anecdotally, this is really more about associated gas as it is oil. But our gas processing facilities are essentially full today, or actually overfull. That just goes to show you, the Permian Basin production is pretty resilient. That's one of the reasons, of course, why we're pushing ahead with the Buffalo gas plant. But that said, it just goes to show you, I think, oil production has been pretty resilient, also. And I think what we're really dealing with here is a demand pull off of the Gulf Coast.","Jon Wolff","Right. All right. Just a random one, since you probably know about this. 200,000, 300,000 stripper wells in west Texas. Just thinking about operating cost thresholds, as the volumes get pretty low. Hearing anything around shut-ins?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Jon, as we have seen in past downturns, as several of us have lived through about five of them, is that, historically, most people just don't shut it in right off the bat. And that's the problem. You have got to lose money for 3, 4, 5 months. People worried about losing leases. And so, it's going to take a good t3, 4, 5 months of real low prices before people start shutting in. They're not going to do it on one month of $15 oil or $18 oil.","Rich Dealy","Yeah, I think the other thing to add there is, the world is now developing, where we're heading more towards more 100% horizontal drilling, those wells can hold production. In holding production, allows to hold those leases for the deeper horizontal drilling, So, you got to be really careful shutting in wells that otherwise would provide for future horizontal drilling.","Jon Wolff","Yep. Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question today is from Dave Kistler, at Simmons & Company.","David Kistler","Good morning, guys.","Scott Sheffield","Hi, Dave.","David Kistler","Just thinking about what's baked into the forward guidance. You have talked about the efficiency gains that you have witnessed kind of down 30%, Q4 to Q4. And you've talked about type curves, 800,000 to 1.2. Is that what you're baking in to 2016 guidance, or are you baking in incremental efficiencies? And are you baking in type curves closer to the 1.3 that you referenced in your January release?","Rich Dealy","Yeah, Dave. First of all, I do expect we will have some more cost savings that come out of the fact that we're 100% now on our new contract. We're on a new cementing contract with Permian here shortly. And we're still putting pressure where we can, albeit, it's relatively limited amount of pressure we can put, as low as the service costs have gone. But I think we can get some reductions. Perhaps, 5% cost reduction. We don't really have that baked in today, as much as we expect that to be in the future. So, with the numbers I gave you in my comments, 7.5, 8 million Permian wells is what we expect before any cost reductions that we can further extract. And so, from that standpoint, we're not really baking in any cost savings. By the same token, the majority of the wells we'll drill, what we focus on is a million to 1.2 million barrel wells. That's the kind of range we talk about. As you have seen and we have talked about, there's quite a large number of wells today which we think may exceed the 1.2. But the guidance we're utilizing and what we have baked in, depending about which zone you're talking about, 1 to 1.2. We hope to be able to exceed that, of course. As you know, we tend to be conservative, because it's just the way we kind of put numbers out.","David Kistler","I appreciate that. That's great color. And then, one of the things in the past you talked about doing more Wolfcamp A wells in 2016, and while the percentage is going up, it seems like you're referencing maybe a larger percentage of A's then B's in prior commentary. Not to suggest that sticking with B's is high grading, but can you maybe walk through whether that's optimization for infrastructure that is causing more B's than A's, or if I'm misinterpreting something?","Frank Hopkins","Hey, Dave. This is Frank. I think what we were referring to before was primarily the northern program. And when you add the B's in, which is the primary focus in the JV area, that's what changed those percentages some from some of the earlier numbers you heard us talk about.","David Kistler","Great. I appreciate that clarification. And then one last one. Just probably a little bit more specific. When you were talking about the cost incurred from rig stacking and from the excess firm gathering and transportation commitments, you indicated that that would be coming down in 2017 and 2018. I suspect that the rig stacking comes down, but the firm gathering and transport commitments, does that really change until you start to accelerate drilling? Any kind of color on that?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, that definitely was just speaking to the stacked drilling charges coming down in 2017 and 2018, the firm commitment in transportation. They will grow some in 2017 and 2018 just with the reduced activity in Eagle Ford for the most part.","David Kistler","Okay, I appreciate that clarification and great work at the drill deck, guys.","Scott Sheffield","Yeah.","Frank Hopkins","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question today is from John Freeman at Raymond James.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys.","Scott Sheffield","Hi, John.","John Freeman","Just wanted to follow up and make sure I heard you right, Scott, on that kind of preliminary kind of commentary around 2017. Was it 10% growth again in 2017 at the strip using roughly half existing cash and no incremental debt? Is that right?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, I said that we will have about $1.7 billion left at the end of this year and we'll be close to 10% production growth for 2017 and about half of that cash will be preserved by the end of 2017.","John Freeman","Perfect. And my one follow up, when I look at the new CAPEX budget versus the one last month, the one last month, how much had been allocated to the vertical integration in that preliminary budget last month versus the 150 in this one?","Frank Hopkins","Yeah. He, John, this is Frank again.","John Freeman","Hi, Frank.","Frank Hopkins","I would say roughly, while we didn't have a hard fast number, there was probably $250 million in what we call other capital category, which is what I think you're referring to and that number is now down by about $100 million.","John Freeman","Perfect. That's what I needed. Thanks guy.","Frank Hopkins","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll move next to Charles Mead at Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Yes. Good morning, guys. If we could go back to slide 12, and Tim I know you already spent a little bit of time on this, but the graph on the right I thought was a pretty powerful demonstration of the improvement you guys have had. And if I'm reading this right, is it -- it looks like that increased well productivity is not really a function of increased lateral length, and so Is it the right conclusion to draw that that's really what we see the progression through the course of 2015 is implementation of that completion optimization program?","Scott Sheffield","That's right. If you look at -- even our first quarter 2015 was lower than our fourth quarter. That's because we had not yet begun the optimization campaign. It started really in earnest very heavily in third and fourth quarter, of course, mostly third quarter. And you start to see that's where we get pretty significant bumps, but I think it's almost 100% related to completion optimization. Lateral lengths, on average, haven't changed that much. So it really has to do more with well performance.","Charles Meade","Got it. And if we were looking at that, this is for just Wolfcamp B, how would the picture look different, if we were to look at that for Wolfcamp A or for the lower Spraberry?","Rich Dealy","Well, Wolfcamp A, I would say, first of all, we don't have enough well control to really talk too much about that. As I mentioned, we put two wells on in the third quarter and two in the fourth quarter. So I don't think we could really step out there and say that's enough data to say definitively that the third was any different than the fourth that significantly. So I don't think you can really say much there. What you can say in lower Spraberry shale is we have been seeing improvements. And those are shown on some of the graphs. Earlier times we were talking about lower Spraberry shale being more 800,000 BOE thinking, but now you can see the data suggesting, based on what we just put on production in the fourth quarter, something that's more approaching a million. So I think you see it clearly there. The Wolfcamp A I simply say there's just not enough time and well control.","Charles Meade","Thanks for that, Tim. And then shifting over to your reserve focus and specifically the puds, it's understandable you're down to 11% puds with not just the strip but also the five year rule on puds. But can you characterize what the puds you still have on your books here at year end, what they are or where they are and how that is different from where you guys have wound up in years past?","Scott Sheffield","Similar to years past. They're predominantly in the Permian basin, as you can imagine. And with a number in the Eagle Ford, but predominantly they're all Permian basin puds. And so there's about 150 of them in total. I would say, I'm flipping here, 90% of them are in the Permian basin.","Frank Hopkins","Charles, it's Frank. They're all horizontal, obviously.","Charles Meade","Right. Right. And that pud percentage is 150 puds, that's a lower absolute number than what you have had in the past as well?","Frank Hopkins","That's right. Just under the five-year rule and where prices are, obviously we have lots of opportunity out there to add, but we have taken, as Tim mentioned, a conservative approach to it. And just want to make sure we manage the five-year rule, and do it at a slow pace.","All of those areas are technically proven. Just a matter of what the SEC will allow us to book, and what we want to book.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thanks for that added detail.","Operator","Our next question today is from Ryan Todd, at Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if I could follow up. You certainly talked about it some throughout the call, but on kind of a philosophical level. I mean, how do you think about balancing rate of return and growth? And maybe get to a little bit as to what the right level of capital is? I mean, can you walk through a little bit of your thought process? Why 12 rigs versus 14 or 10? What's the right number for the way to think about capital, and how that informs the view going forward? As cash flow increases, do you generally just ramp up as things cross the returns threshold? Or what will drive kind of the absolute level of capital spend, near term and longer term?","Rich Dealy","Yes, Ryan, first of all, returns is first. So having good returns in this price environment is number one. Number two, as I said earlier, we decided it was important to show a reduction from our January call, and also from last year. And so, we're gaining so much efficiencies in optimization, that when we saw the numbers. I mean, how many companies can reduce 50% of your rigs and still show 10% plus production growth. So we sort of targeted 2 billion capital, 10% plus production growth. And preserving most of our cash on the balance sheet all year.","Going forward, when prices recover, you will probably see us do more hedging in 2017, 2018. In three ways, most likely. And then, we will start putting rigs back to work, and the returns will even be better than what Tim mentioned, at 30%. So that's how we will look at it going forward.","Ryan Todd","Okay. I mean, I guess if you think about it directionally, I mean, you laid out a plan right now, which implies some amount of incremental growth in 2017 with this strip. Will you generally ramp proportionally to how cash flow grows?","Rich Dealy","We still got the $1.6, $1.7 billion of cash sitting out there. So it's a question of how fast we employ that. So, I can promise you, we're going to be the number one growth company in 2016 and 2017, in the industry. Most likely 2018, because we have a great balance sheet and we can jump start quicker than anybody else. Most companies are going to have to rush out and sell assets, or go to the equity markets, at some point in time, to deleverage. And so, we will be focusing on adding rigs back to work fairly quickly. With 30 days' notice, we can add rigs back. So, we will have to decide on what growth rate is right in that 2017, 2018 environment. But I said we could get back to 15%. I told Brian Singer that, if oil got back to between 50 and 50-plus, on its way in the strip towards 60, we will probably be hedging and probably moving toward that 15% production growth rate.","Ryan Todd","Great. I appreciate that. And maybe if I could ask one more. Production levels in the U.S. have continued its price to the upside. Yours included. I think some of that is clearly efficiency gains. it does seem as well as if some of the base production is holding in a little bit better than expected. I mean, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, in terms of base decline across your portfolio? Whether it's better or worse than you thought it would be, and whether the optimized completions, looking forward, whether you think they'll have any impact on declines going forward?","Rich Dealy","Well, on Eagle Ford, at least we will be able to establish a decline now, since we have zero rigs running. And so, we got a pretty good handle on that. And Permian is doing much better than expected. And with our balance sheet, that's why we're able to grow. Now, everybody, I read all of you all's reports, and most of you all are saying that, so far, people were reporting future reports that U.S. shale should drop 5, 6, 700,000 barrels a day. So, that has to happen so we can have a meaningful recovery in prices by the end of the year. If it doesn't happen, then the recovery is going to be a lot slower. So, I get it mostly from you all reports, based on other people's reporting.","Ryan Todd","All right, great. Thanks for saying that.","Rich Dealy","Balance sheet is the problem.","Ryan Todd","Right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeffrey Campbell, at Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. Regarding the cessation of the drilling in the JV, was this a joint agreement, or does Pioneer have priority as the operator on deciding if drilling takes place or not.","Scott Sheffield","Are you talking about, in this case, the southern Wolfcamp area?","Jeffrey Campbell","Correct.","Scott Sheffield","During the period, we have basically unilateral rights to make the decisions regarding what's going to get drilled. However, we don't really run a JV that way. We closely consult with our partner. In this case, Sinochem, and we have come to a joint agreement on this rig count.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thank you. The reason I ask is just because you highlighted that the best wells in the southern JV look very competitive. So, just kind of wondering\u2026","Scott Sheffield","Certainly, if you look at the map and where we see the best well results, they clearly are in the northern part of the southern acreage. I think we can drill very good economic wells there. However, our partner's in a situation where they have their own views and they have their own situation. And so, we can just simply take those rigs and focus them on the north, and be able to achieve at a high rate there.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And sticking with southern JV, what's the timing of 2016 placing on production? I'm just wondering how to correlate the production coming online with the fact that drilling is going to cease after the middle of the year.","Scott Sheffield","Well, yeah, the drilling campaign will be done in the middle of the year. Of course, in the case of the south, we will be completing those wells through the third quarter.","Jeffrey Campbell","And if I could ask one last one real quick. You provided a 7.5 to 8 million cost range for 9,000 foot lateral, currently. What percentage of 2016 drilling is expected to average around 9,000 feet? If there's drilling that's not going to be around that average, what kind of numbers are you thinking about?","Rich Dealy","The average is going to be about 9,000 feet. Maybe slightly above that. Realizing that we are now drilling wells in excess of 12,000 feet, in some areas where we can and where the leasehold provides for that. We also drill wells, in some cases, at 7 to 8,000 feet. So the average comes to slightly over 9,000 feet.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Morris, at Citi.","Bob Morris","Thank you. Scott or Tim, two quarters ago, when you first talked about handing 2 rigs per month through the second half of the year, you had said then that, if you got to year end, when you were at the point of turning those wells on, that if oil prices were still lower, that you just wouldn't turn the wells on. And I recognize that efficiencies have improved since then. You have added some incremental hedges since then. And that you look at returns on a strip basis here. But, Scott, given your view that oil prices are going be weaker. Over the next few months, could drop even lower, why not still not turn those wells on at this point and just wait the 3 to 4 months or 6 months, whatever it is, until oil prices are a lot higher and build an inventory of ducks, like you're doing in the Eagle Ford, or like a lot of your peers are doing here?","Tim Dove","Well, there's still 475 rigs, 450 drilling oil wells in the U.S. It's a shame we can't all get together. It's collusion, I guess. The federal government calls it shutting everything in at once. But we have to preserve our people. We got over 20,000 drilling locations. So keeping a few locations going on. And based on the strip, we all knew what the strip was over the next 5 years. We can make different decisions, but we don't. We're keeping them going because of the strip and the returns are good. They're not 25, for the next 5 years. If I knew they were going to be $25, $30 the next 5 years, we wouldn't be drilling any rigs today. But I don't.","Scott Sheffield","So, Bob, I guess I would add on to that by saying, one of the real big objectives for us, and I've alluded to it quite a bit on this call, is to make sure that we push forward our knowledge regarding optimization of completions. And so, just drilling a well doesn't cut that, and we got to get them on production and see how they produce. Get the learning\u2019s in place so that when we actually reach the upturn that we're ready to accelerate at a high level of performance, because we built that knowledge base about how to optimize completions in the different areas, for the different zones. So, ducking wells just doesn't cut it. And from that standpoint, we have got to keep moving ahead, in terms of our knowledge base, so that when things improve, we can hit it with all cylinders.","Bob Morris","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Sankey at Wolf Research.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the information. I was just wondering on your hedging strategy, you mentioned that you're 85% covered for this year and 20% for next year. If we just do the strip as what happens over the next year, would we assume that you would basically be in 2017 in a year's time in a similar hedge position, which is to say unhedged more or less or 20% hedged? Or would you sort of just start adding anyway? Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Paul, there's a lot of volatility in the market. If you look at the last 12 months it's moved around $8, the strip. And so obviously, I'm hoping that there's some actions or rumors or whatever it takes to move the strip up over the next several months. And we will probably be fairly aggressive in hedging in 2017. So it's hard to -- if the strip moves down from here, we're not going to be hedging any more in 2017. But I think there's a good chance with news reports of U.S. shale falling or rumors by Russia or I guess there's one today about a freeze on OPEC production. You've got to use events like that to put hedges in the marketplace.","Paul Sankey","True, I understand. So you want to retain the discipline that you've shown in terms of maintaining a hedge book, but perhaps not just as low as we are today?","Scott Sheffield","Exactly. There will be chances that it spikes, the 2017 strip over the next ten months and we will probably be putting on some hedges.","Paul Sankey","Okay. And separately, the operating cash flow guidance that you gave of $1.3 billion at $36 a barrel, we're coming in a bit low on our numbers. First, wondering is there any working capital changes or anything else in the number that we should account for or can you back us into that number just so that we're very clear? Thank you.","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, it's in the operating cash flow. I mean there's not much in the way of working capital changes, so it was just when we put together the charts that was the price tick at the time. Obviously, the commodity deck has moved since then and so we will continue to watch it and see where we end up. But at 36 and 235 we think we will be at the $1.3 billion level.","Paul Sankey","Yeah. We just wanted to clarify this, if you like a clean number. But I appreciate that. Thank you all.","Operator","We'll take our next question today from Michael Hall at Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Many of mine have been addressed. I'm just curious, as you look at the 2016 program now versus what you provided a little over a month ago, it seems like Permian's outperforming even over that timeframe, given the reduction in the Eagle Ford, in particular. I'm just curious, I guess. Number one, what was the prior expectation around Eagle Ford as it relates to production growth or declines on the prior rig count? And then did you change at all your assumptions around the Permian on risking your productivity or anything on the like?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, Michael, first of all, on Eagle Ford, we had stated that in the range of four to six rig count that we would be basically able to keep production essentially flat. At the time during the call, remember we talked about reducing it to four with the potential to reduce it lower. So, obviously in today's world, Eagle Ford production will be declining. It's simply a product of the fact that there's, in our areas particularly, there's quite a lot of NGLs and natural gas in the flowstream, as well as the fact it condensates in our area. It fetches a price which is generally going to be $10 off WTI. So, in today's world, let's just say $17 per barrel. So the economics is we're getting trounced by the commodities on all three fronts and that led to the decision.","By the same token, if you look at Permian, however, the Permian assets pretty clearly are continuing to outperform. I would expect that to be the same going forward as we put our team of geoscientists and engineers to work in the laboratory understanding how to complete all these wells optimally. And that's what's going to happen. And so it's a nice trade to be able to take monies out of Eagle Ford, where the economics are not very good today, and put them in an area that's outperforming.","Michael Hall","Certainly. Yeah, it makes plenty of sense. I guess, touching on offset a little bit, the completion optimization program in the Permian, I guess we've seen a huge, obviously 50% as you showed step change year-on-year in the Wolfcamp B program. Other programs are moving along the learning curve as well. I'm just curious how you think that rate of change changes over time. And how quickly does that rate of improvement flatten out? Maybe using the Eagle Ford as an analogy?","Scott Sheffield","Well, I think first of all the optimization campaign at Eagle Ford took a couple of years for us to pull off. But Eagle Ford is much smaller aerial extent and quite a smaller amount of shale in the sense that the 300 foot or so that you have at Eagle Ford. You have to focus on the fact that even in 2016 we're changing what we're doing in terms of optimization. We're pushing the limits. So we're not standing pat on the 2015 campaign optimization, as I mentioned, we're now looking at, for example, going into a situation where we might even have 15 foot cluster spacing. That would have been unheard of in the past. We'll see how that does. We'll see how we do in terms of increasing our profit concentrations up to let's just say 2,000 pounds per foot. We'll see how we do in terms of spacing and stacking situations in different zones. So I would say we're still pretty early days. We're still improving, we're still learning with every well. And I would anticipate that going through the 2016 campaign and realizing that's one of the reasons we need to keep some rigs running is because we need to get to the end of the plan so when we're ready to add rigs, we're doing it optimally.","Michael Hall","Yep, that's certainly encouraging. It makes sense. And then, I guess, last one on my end, around the commentary about 10% growth in 2017, what sort of rig count assumptions are baked into that?","Scott Sheffield","It's about the same. No change.","Michael Hall","About the same, okay. Very good, appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Beard, at Coker Palmer.","David Beard","Good morning, gentlemen. Appreciate you squeezing me in here. My question is really related to the scenarios for 2017. And you mentioned, if oil stays sub-30, you may reduce activity. Should we think about you being cash flow neutral, if oil stays lower next year? Or how would you think about cash burn next year in a low oil price environment?","Rich Dealy","We haven't made those runs. But, obviously, we have preserved most of our cash position of the $1.7 billion that I talked about going into 2017. So, cash flow probably 700, 800 million, at $30 oil. I'm just guessing off the top of my head. Rich is looking at me. So, you probably get down and just spend 700, 800 million, if that, and then preserve your $1.7 billion.","David Beard","Good. I appreciate the color. I know we're all playing \"what if\" here with the commodity prices. But thanks for the time.","Rich Dealy","Yeah.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the program back over to our speakers for any additional or concluding remarks.","Scott Sheffield","Again, thank you very much for participating on the call. I look forward to seeing everybody out on the road or the next quarter. Again, thank you very much.","Operator","And, Ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference and, again, thank you all for joining us today."],"17226":["Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

Joining us today will be Scott Sheffield, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Dove, President and Chief Operating Officer; Rich Dealy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Hopkins, Senior Vice President Investor Relations.","Pioneer has prepared PowerPoint slides to supplement their comments today. These slides can be accessed over the Internet at www.pxd.com. Again, the Internet site to access the slides related to today's call is www.pxd.com. At the website, select Investors then select Earnings and Webcasts. This call is being recorded a replay of the call will be archived on the Internet site through May 20.","The company's comments today will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements and the business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in Pioneer's news release on page two of the slide presentation and in Pioneer's public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","At this time, for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to Pioneer's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Frank Hopkins. Please go ahead, sir.","Frank Hopkins","Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm going to briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott will be the first speaker. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter of 2016. Another quarter which saw the company deliver solid execution and outstanding performance. Scott will then review our latest plans for 2016 in the face of continuing commodity price uncertainty. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our continuing strong horizontal well results and capital efficiency improvements in the Spraberry Wolfcamp. Rick will then cover the first quarter financials and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2016. And after that, we'll open up the call as always for your questions.","So Scott, I'll turn the call over to you.","Scott Sheffield","Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Slide number three financial and operating highlights. We had a first-quarter adjusted loss of $104 million or $0.64 per diluted share. What's more important is that the company hit record production again first quarter of 2016, 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 55% oil. So we're well along on our movement from 52% to 56% oil from 2015 to 2016. Way above Pioneer's guidance range of 211,000 barrels per day equivalent to 216, an increase of 7000 barrels per day equivalent or 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Oil production is up 10,000 barrels of oil per day or 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Obviously driven by the growth of the Spraberry Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. What's also a milestone for the company by gross production in the Spraberry Wolfcamp fields exceeded 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for the first time and total field production has exceeded and surpassed 1 million barrels of oils equivalent per day and still growing. Probably the only field growing in today's environment in North America.","We placed 55 horizontal wells on production in the Spraberry Wolfcamp field during the first quarter. All wells benefited from completion optimization, which Tim will give you a lot more detail. Continuing to realize significant capital efficiency gains in the field, both with the optimization program, longer lateral lengths, increasing and enhancing well productivity. Drilling and completion efficiencies and cost reduction initiatives are still driving down a cost per lateral foot.","What's also more important, again, reducing our combined production costs and G&A expense for the quarter versus fourth quarter of 15%. We continue over the next several quarters to see continued improvement in regard to those numbers.","We also added the recently target operated Spraberry Wolfcamp gas processing plant of 200 million per day. It's online and essentially it's up to about 120 million a day and that came from other plants which reduced their intake and in those other plants, so there's plenty of room for the next two or three years for additional capacity. Pioneer just reminds people we do own 27% of this system.","Increased Oil & Gas derivative coverage for 2017. We've already released these numbers and we'll talk a bit more about it and moving our hedges up primarily 50% for 2017.","Slide number four, on our outlook. We plan to maintain our 12 horizontal rigs in the North Spraberry Wolfcamp field based on favorable returns in the area. We are currently operating 12 horizontal rigs in the North and two in the South and the two in the South will be terminated by the end of June. As I had mentioned on previous calls, our partner Sinochem will look more at a $50 oil price to reinitiate any rig activity at that point in time. This activity level is expected to deliver production growth at 12% plus, which we have raised up from 10% plus in 2016 and will allow the company to progress its completion optimization program. The higher forecasted growth rate reflects the improving Spraberry Wolfcamp well productivity.","We are keeping our planned capital expenditures the same for both drilling activity and vertical integration spending at $2 billion for 2016, $1.5 billion for drilling and $150 million for vertical integration systems upgrades and field facilities.","We get asked all the time, we put the comment in here, but Pioneer expects to add five to ten horizontal rigs when the price of oil recovers to $50 a barrel and the outlook for oil supply demand fundamentals is positive. So what do we mean by this? I mean, what's ideal? The strip in 17 has moved up to about $47, $47.50 for oil. Today's price is close to $44. So if we see the strip in 17, for instance, get up to $50, and we see inventory start to decrease which gives confidence in the supply-demand fundamentals, we know the supply side is dropping, the U.S. should see a significant drop in the third quarter on U.S. shale, probably a good 400,000 or 500,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, especially as reported by the EIA. And so what's ideal? We don't want to add them all at the same time. We would like to add a few at a time. So I know Frank gets asked the questions a lot, so that gives you a little bit more flavor and detail.","Going to slide number 5, on our hedge position. Obviously we're almost fully hedged for 2016. For oil we moved our hedges up from 20% to 50% for 2017. The detailed hedges are in the back. We would like to also continue to move that number up in 2017 over time as we see the oil price continue to move up in 2017.","We did a little bit more gas hedging for 2017. It's up to about 25%, still about 70% for 2016. That leaves us very strong investment-grade balance sheet. I think we're one of only six or seven companies that Moody rates investment-grade now. The forecasted cash flow enables the company to grow production and fund its expected capital program through 2017 without increasing debt. Our cash on hand liquid investments at $2.5 billion in the first quarter includes proceeds from the successful equity offering in early January. Also includes $940 million that'll fund the July 16 and March 17 senior note maturities. An additional half billion dollars will come in July 2016 from our Eagle Ford midstream sale business that we did in 2015. Pro forma net debt to 2016 operating cash flow of 0.4. At the end of the first quarter we had a debt to book of 10%.","Going to slide six. No change in our capital program. I think the only change on this slide is the fact that star had \u2013 the star is moving around on the rainbow chart. It's up to $1.4 billion. If the strip holds the rest of the year it'll be up closer to $1.5 billion. So that gives us an extra $100 million to $200 million of cash that'll be added into our coffers by the end of 2016.","Slide number seven. Obviously again reminding people we did increase our production growth forecast from 10% plus to 12% plus. So that takes us up to 229,000 barrels a day equivalent for 2016. Still keeping oil at 56%, up from 52% due to our well productivity in the Spraberry Wolfcamp. Our oil growth has gone up from 20% to 24% plus. Again, expect continued production growth over the 16\/18 period. Obviously it'll depend on the pace of the commodity price recovery.","I'll now turn it over to Tim to get into more detail on our optimization program.","Timothy Dove","Thanks, Scott. I'll turn now to slide eight and I think it's safe to say our completion optimization campaign in the northern part of the Spraberry Wolfcamp continues to show very impressive results. Toward that end, I'd point you to the graph on the top left. This is a Wolfcamp B graph which shows all of the wells that have been completed utilizing our optimization campaign since the mid-part of last year, mid-2015. That's a total of 68 wells. What you see in the blue curve is an average of all of those wells in terms of its early production and you can see it's pretty clear that blue line far exceeds the million barrel BOE Type Curve shown below. In fact, we would calculate that the early production range would show about a 35% improvement compared to that curve. So that's obviously extremely positive from the standpoint of our completion testing.","And then if you look to the top right, the Wolfcamp A, we see similar results although realizing it's a substantial smaller sample size, with only 13 wells at the mid-part of last year. I think it's really too early to call what the ultimate uplift will be for the Wolfcamp A, but for the time being the chart would easily show a 20% improvement compared to the Million Barrel Type Curve. Lower Spraberry shale, again, a relatively smaller sample size, 16 wells in the same timeframe.","Early results again but we are showing improvement. We calculate this more about 10% over the Million Barrel Type Curve currently. But suffice it to say, on the 97 wells that we have performed completion optimization on through the end of the first quarter, we see significant improvement. Forty-two of those wells of the 97 that is, were placed on production in the first quarter and have seen similar productivity gains as had been the case in the prior couple of quarters. And now it's the case that these 97 wells provide a baseline for further testing that we're doing in 2016. And I'll talk more about that in a couple of slides.","On slide nine, we see similar results in the southern Wolfcamp area from the standpoint of the completion optimization, where we've tested about 22 wells through the end of the first quarter. You can see in the graph on the left the effects of the Wolfcamp B again, in this case about a 25% improvement over that Million Barrel Type Curve on 21 wells since the fourth quarter last year. And then similarly on the Wolfcamp A an improvement of about 25%, in this case above the 800,000 BOE Type Curve which we tend to see in the South. Of course, that's only one well in the Wolfcamp A on the bottom right graph but nonetheless, it's also encouraging.","Turning now to slide 10, this is the slide in which we show a little bit more detail on how these completion designs have adjusted through time. If you look at the left-hand part of the slide, you see our basic initial design of fracs during the period of 2013\/2014, which is early days in terms of the play, and it generally had us with probably no more than 1000 pounds of sand per foot, 30 pounds \u2013 sorry, 30 barrels per foot of fluids, 60 foot cluster spacing, 240 foot stage spacing. And the idea there was long half-length fracs was the initial design concept to reach out and touch rock far away from the well bore.","As we move forward into 2015, the second half of 2015 to the first quarter, we've now put these 97 wells on production in the North, 22 in the South. It's the subject of really more of the same, which is 1400 pounds. You can see on this graph 36 barrels of fluid and so on, tighter cluster spacing. Of course, that does cost money. That's what gets us to about the $7.5 million to $8 million well cost based on 9000 foot lateral, the additional 500,000 coming from this frac design.","But in essence, the frac design that we put in place and we now see the results for becomes the new standard design and really the new base case that we're testing the further optimization techniques that we're employing this year. We're going to see more results as we go. There's an 80-well campaign underway to really substantially increase the profit utilization in some cases up to 2000 pounds per foot and in some cases over 50 barrels per foot of fluid and even down to 15-foot cluster spacing.","And so we really are pushing the design envelope right now to hopefully be able to reach some sort of optimal stage here by the end of this year in terms of how to complete these wells at least from the standpoint of utilization of current technology. And the additional amount of fluid and profit and so on does add about $500,000 to $1 million per well and I think it's \u2013 we believe the optimization actually will have a positive payout but stay tuned on that because we won't see much data on this until we get into the second through the fourth quarters. As you can see, just depicted from a cartoon standpoint, what we are trying to do is now design completions to allow more rock near the well bore to be contacted. It also will allow us theoretically to more tightly space the wells and optimize recoveries.","So I think this is an action that we have been planning on for some time. We have this well underway as we speak and hope to see some positive results going forward. We'll certainly know much more in the next few quarters. This is really one of the critical reasons that we mentioned in regard to maintaining our 12-rig campaign because we really need to continue our further understanding of this completion optimization business so that we're ready when we accelerate our drilling campaign when things improve in terms of commodities to do so in an optimal fashion.","Turning now to slide 11. Another area where we've been successful in adding value is extending laterals in this case beyond 10,000 feet. We placed a couple of our longest laterals on production in the first quarter, 11,000 and 13,000 feet of perforations, each of which was the subject of completion optimization. Of course, those wells being longer laterals, adding roughly $10 million each. Early data looks very encouraging. As shown here on the graph on the bottom you see in the green line the two most recent wells, the longer lateral wells, as compared to wells that were drilled prior to those which had shorter laterals.","So in the case of the 23 wells you see on the blue curve, you see below that 13 wells which are on the grey curve. It's pretty clear to see that the longer laterals are in fact contributing really substantial improvements over the earlier predecessors which were more like 9500 foot laterals and 7000 foot laterals. So I think it's pretty clear we continue to see a very strong correlation between lateral length, perforated lateral length and well productivity and we continue to see that as we look forward.","I would say we'd do the calculations over 60% or so of our acreage is amenable to base on the lease hold configurations over 10,000 foot lateral drilling.","Turning now to slide 12. This is an update essentially from a slide that we shared with you last quarter. It shows now a 32% decrease from year end 2014 until the first quarter in terms of our drilling and completion costs per foot. We still are at a point where we think we can reduce this going forward. The easiest way to explain it is we still are under old drilling contracts with very high day rates in the mid-20s where today's rates are probably more in the mid-teens.","So we continue, as those contracts roll off, to see reductions, not considering the fact we're also going to be continuing to try to optimize regarding completions and one of the major areas where we see cost reduction opportunities has been in our frac fleet efficiency where we really measure that in terms of the number of feet that are completed per day by each fleet and in this case we've seen the average Pioneer pumping services fleet increased substantially from about 800 feet per day of lateral section completed to about 1200 feet per day during the first quarter. That translates directly into speed of the job as well as an addition the cost reductions that come from time. And really what it amounts to is we're getting more wells popped faster and that's simply another component of outperformance when it comes to production. And it certainly, of course further helps to reduce costs and improve our overall drilling economics.","Turning now to slide 13. Activity continues to be focused on the north where our plans are essentially unchanged from where we were last quarter and Scott mentioned the fact we'll be drilling with the 12 rigs in the North with about 230 wells to be on production. Our mix of wells still is predominantly Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A. The mix essentially remains the same. What was now the \u2013 prior of course the standard completion technique is now subject to the new optimization campaign I mentioned earlier and if we look at this from the standpoint of the 2015 optimization campaign, we're still in that $7.5 million to $8 million cost per well assuming 9000 foot laterals. In addition to which to the extent the optimization is completed on those wells in the new style of optimization we had on our $500,000 or $1 million per well.","One advantage we have in this field is a tremendous opportunity presented by low LOE. Because these are very high volume wells and they typically run $3 to $5 per BOE in terms of at least operating expense. When you add taxes on you have a very favorable $5 to $7 total cost to operate these wells and that's one of the reasons you'll \u2013 Rich will comment on this, but you continue to see our LOE per BOE reduce through time is simply because as we add more of these horizontal wells into the mix it just drives down our averages in terms of LOE.","The economics still look good. I think they're still conducive to our drilling activity and certainly with regard to where prices are today, would exceed 30% IRR. It's probably in the neighborhood of approaching 40%. And it also, of course, allows us to progress our completion optimization campaign and be ready to optimally move ahead when we think we get the price messages to accelerate drilling.","And then on slide 14, the outstanding well performance I've been talking about in the Spraberry Wolfcamp area is driving strong growth and actually with production exceeding our forecast once again, it has led us in this field to increase our guidance for the rest of the year and actually, the total year now is 167,000 BOE compared to an earlier forecast of 162. First quarter production was very strong. Scott has already touched on a lot of these numbers but in this field particularly we had 149,000 BOE per day, almost 70% oil and increased about 9% since the fourth quarter of last year. We did put the 55 wells on production this quarter; 42 in the north, 13 in the South. And you can see on this slide the mix of wells. Again, it's very similar to the mix of campaign of 2016 in total which is predominance on A\/B wells. Once again, production in the quarter benefited from the completion optimization longer laterals pop timing due to efficiency gains and everything we've been talking about in the prior slides.","Looking forward, we are increasing the growth rate of the field to about 33% this year. It had been at 30. Again, just reflecting on these productivity gains and we will be popping estimated about 60 wells in the second quarter, that compares to 55 in the first quarter. We are utilizing choke management in some areas and what that leads to is a situation where 24-hour IP rates and even in some cases 30-day IP rates can really have less meaning when we are optimizing the use of the infrastructure in the area without overbuilding water capacity for peak production. What we're doing, of course, is we're pumping with more fluid.","We're also just by choice completing more wells near existing infrastructure and what that has the effect of doing is filling up our water handling capacity so what we do is we choke the wells back typically for a couple of weeks, can be two to four weeks, in order to basically allow them to produce and not overfill those facilities and at which point in time we would basically full produce the wells. But again, as I said, one of the main aspects of this to consider is I think it's the right economic decision but at the same time it will cause IP rates in some cases to appear a bit odd because of the curtailment of the wells in certain areas. I think we'll see a little bit less of this going into the next quarter simply because where we're choosing to complete the wells in the quarter.","So overall, I'd say it's a stellar quarter for the company from an operational standpoint and it sure sets us up well for a strong 2016 from a standpoint of full-year results.","And with that, I'm going to pass it too Rich for his review of the financials for the quarter and also his outlook for the second quarter.","Richard Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on slide 15. We reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $267 million after-tax or $1.65 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market losses of $111 million after-tax or $0.69. And then you can see on the slide here included unusual items, aggregating a $52 million loss or $0.32 per diluted share principally related to impairments, one on the West Panhandle field and one in Alaska where we held a royalty interest and some unproved acreage. Those were mainly due to lower commodity prices at the end of March.","We also took a charge of $10 million associated with the early termination of 10 drilling rig contracts that we're not going to use prior to their exploration and so that was just a cost-saving decision to do that. So after adjusting for the unusual items that Scott mentioned, we are at $140 million loss or $0.64, principally attributable to the lower commodity price environment that we're dealing with.","If you look at the bottom of slide 15, we show Q1 guidance versus results. Scott talked about the outperformance on production. And then if you look at really the rest of the items, they were either on the positive side of guidance or within guidance throughout there, so I won't go through each in detail, just to say that it was a really good quarter. The company's cost structure continues to come down and so other than the backdrop of commodity prices, really excellent results.","Turning to slide 16, looking at price realizations in more detail. As you guys all know, it was a tough quarter on pricing. Oil prices for the company were down 26% to $28.09. NGLs were down 15% to $10.33 per barrel and gas prices were down 12% to $1.79. Fortunately for the company we were well hedged and so we were mitigated by our derivative portfolio rate, running about $217 million of incremental cash flow from our derivatives. Hopefully the first quarter was the low point as commodity prices have strengthened some in the second quarter and so hopefully we've seen the bottom and future quarters will show better realizations.","The one other item I'd point out at the bottom on our NYEMX differential for oil for the first quarter, you can see it was up a little over a dollar that differential. That's predominantly due to Eagle Ford condensate sales. In the last year, if you recall, we were exporting about 20,000 gross barrels per day of condensate. That contract expired at the end of the year and so we had a few minor spot sales in the first quarter but principally got domestic pricing and so that caused our differential to go back up. We do have or expect to see improved pricing in the second quarter with improved domestic pricing under new contract.","Turning to slide 17 and production costs. All of the asset teams, as Tim talked about, have really done a great job on working to lower their cost structure and improve our margins. You can see that production costs were down 17% in total from Q4 to Q1. Base LOE was down 20% quarter-on-quarter, principally related to lower costs on chemicals, electricity, contract services and just efficiency improvements that the operations guys are doing to really help with margins. So overall, production costs continue to trend lower and plus as Tim mentioned, we are adding more horizontal wells to the mix of wells with an average of %$5 to $7 per BOE of production cost which will help continue to drive these costs down.","Turning to slide 18, the company's balance sheet, we have excellent liquidity with net debt at the end of the quarter $1.1 billion. That's net of cash on hand in our liquid investments about $2.5 billion. We're still expecting to get the $500 million in July from our Eagle Ford midstream business sale that we did last year that'll come in July. Undrawn credit facility of $1.5 billion is still completely unused. As you're aware, we have pre-funded our 2016 and 2017 bond maturities and so that's in the $2.5 billion of cash on hand and so no near-term maturities. We've got that all taken care of.","And during the last 60 days or so we have been affirmed by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, so obviously recognizing the company's strength of our balance sheet. So overall, I'd say excellent balance sheet, well-positioned to increase activity levels when oil prices improve, as Scott and Tim both talked about.","Turning to slide 19 and switching gears to second-quarter guidance, we are forecasting production of 224,000 to 229,000 BOE per day for the quarter. The rest of the items here are really consistent with first-quarter results, so rather than going through each of those in detail, I'll let you read through those. But consistent with what you would've saw from first-quarter actual results.","So with that, why don't we stop there and we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Freeman with Raymond James. Your line is open.","John Freeman","Good morning, guys. Terrific quarter.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks, John.","John Freeman","First question I had, obviously given a lot of the efficiency gains, Tim, that you talked about, you brought online significantly more wells than you originally expected in the Spraberry Wolfcamp in the first quarter, but yet the full-year guide still says to expect the same 230 wells on production. So maybe if you could just speak to is there any reason to expect those efficiency gains to not continue?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, John, I'd say first of all, we did, because of the efficiency, complete a few wells, really a handful, probably ten more wells than we had planned in the quarter. Most of those were near the very end of the quarter as you might expect, just the way the timing works and so they don't have much of an effect on the first-quarter results as they will have more of an effect in the second quarter. But as to the bigger picture, I think we're going to see continuous optimization gains across the board. It has to do with all the things I mentioned regarding the completion optimization campaign on the one hand but also mixing in longer laterals. We're going to have 10 to 20 long lateral wells here in the mix for 2016 as well. So I think it's going to be more of an all of the above. I think you're going to see continuous gains and I think you'll see us hopefully continue to outperform.","John Freeman","Okay. And then just last question for me. On the two wells that you did that averaged about the 12,000 foot lateral, I just wanted to verify that the only difference between those wells and the others on that slide 11 is just the lateral length? They didn't benefit from this, I guess for lack of a better version, the 3.0 optimization plan that you're going to do on these 80 wells? Like, that was just straight lateral length longer versus the others?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, essentially that's correct if you saw what I mentioned in there, it was the, what we now call the baseline optimization, not the 2016 version which we compare them exactly with all the rest of the wells that were drilled prior.","John Freeman","Perfect. Great quarter, guys. Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll move next to Dave Kistler with Simmons and Company. Your line is open.","David Kistler","Good morning, guys. Great work. Looking at the increased production or the impressive production beat that you guys delivered and kind of building on the last question, can you break down a little bit of what the benefit was of weather versus additional completions versus well productivity in terms of what drove that beat? I'm guessing from the answer you gave previously, it's primarily well productivity versus additional wells popped, but any added color you can give on that would be helpful.","Scott Sheffield","Okay, Dave. Yeah, the weather was not a factor. We were fortunate this year as compared to \u2013 you recall some of our prior years with ice storms and gosh, who knows what? We were really hammered two out of the last three years, but this year we got lucky and had good weather. So it was not whether and I already mention the fact that we had let's say ten additional completions. Really it's semi-immaterial for the first quarter because they were late in the quarter. So it has all to do with well productivity and this has to do with the fact that the graphs I showed really depict the fact that we're producing better wells and better initial rates. And when you have better initial rates than what you had planned in the forecast, then you're going to exceed and that's what's happening.","David Kistler","Great. So the way to view that is definitely much more secular in nature, not just a temporal item?","Scott Sheffield","I think we're going to continue to improve is what I'd say.","David Kistler","And then following up also, last quarter you guided to shut-ins as a result of fracking offsetting wells. When you guys kind of think about that going forward, will there be a continued impact from fracking offsetting wells? Or should we actually look towards maybe even a slightly larger uptick associated with not doing that going forward?","Scott Sheffield","So the way to think about that is we did in fact shut in almost exactly the number of wells and barrels that we had planned in the first quarter substantially more than we had shut in in the fourth quarter. So despite that, our production exceeded. That said, I think our second-quarter numbers look lower in terms of shut in offset production. It's just simply a matter of the mix of wells and where they're being drilled and completed. It just so happens in the second quarter we haven't got as many offset issues as we had where the wells were chosen for the first quarter. So I would anticipate that number to come down somewhat.","David Kistler","Okay. Appreciate that. And then one last one. When you talk about adding incremental rigs, kind of five to ten, and staging them in, can you talk a little bit about how you sit with respect to personnel to handle that ramp up and maybe specifically with the tool pusher and the effective driller on each one of those rigs?","Scott Sheffield","We've actually had the good fortune of hanging around with some of our drilling contractors the last few days and they are ready to add rigs and they're getting pinged upon right now by industry, as you might expect, to start potentially adding rigs. And they would make the case that if you were talking about a handful of rigs like we are, let's just say five to ten rigs, that's no problem at all. It's when we start to have a major acceleration where they would have issues because what they've done, of course, is to keep most of their management and supervisory personnel. They don't have to really rebuild staff. There's quite a few people who are available to come back to work, it's just a matter of making that happen.","So I don't think a small number of rigs that we're really talking about today is that material of an issue. As for us, of course, we have this advantage that's associated with having Pioneer pumping services, Pioneer well services. We have our own people ready to go complete our own wells and work on our own wells. And so we won't miss a beat and I think our drilling contractors will be there with us in good shape at least for this first tranche.","David Kistler","Great. Well, I appreciate the added color. Fantastic work, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Arun Jayaram","Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit \u2013 or ask you a little bit about the new guidance. You raised your overall guidance by 2% and oil by 4%. And I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of well productivity gains that you've assumed in your new guidance because it is the same number of wells. You guys have talked about seeing 10% to 35% improvements in well productivity but what is it in the new guidance?","Richard Dealy","Arun, basically what we've done is we pushed up some of the productivity, if you want to call them EURs internally, on wells in certain areas based on results that we've seen now not only for the first quarter but the past two quarters. I get the question all the time, when are we going to raise our Type Curve and the answer is give us a couple of more quarters. Let us get some more data. I think you've heard Tim and Scott say that we think we'll have a pretty good understanding of the Wolfcamp B by the end of this year or we'll certainly be in a position to do that. Wolfcamp A lower Spraberry shale, it might take into next year just because of the timing again of getting an update. We're trying to not get too far out in front of this but we also recognize that we do have to provide you with some reasonable estimates of where production is going to go based on our actual results.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. That's helpful. That's helpful. Just a second question perhaps Tim, in terms of lateral lengths. You've been drilling wells kind of in the 8200 and 9200 foot range. You've obviously announced some results on the wells beyond 10,000 foot. Have you had any conclusions on what you think the optimal lateral foot could be in terms of drilling and some of the wells in the shale ranch? You think that could be applicable to other parts of your acreage position outside of Martin?","Richard Dealy","Well, you're going to see different well results in all different areas. So the sale ranch happens to be one of our really good areas, so I don't think you would necessarily say that that's going to be the same exact result everywhere we drill but I think what you'll see is the same sort of upticks on lateral drilling or lateral extensions. And the way we look at it is where we are today, unless you stay out to 13,000 feet, is probably the economic limit in realizing if you're talking about extended reach drilling it could be tens of thousands of feet longer than that. The issue is these are wells in which we're pumping very large fracs so you have hydraulic limitations out at the toe where you're not going to be able to necessarily get off as an effective frac. And we think we're still pretty close to linear in terms of the relationship between lateral links out to 11,000 to 13,000 feet and productivity of the well.","In other words, one-to-one payout and we know the economics are strong from that standpoint. But I think we're almost at the limit in terms of the fact that even though we could drill longer wells, completing them becomes a hydraulic issue. And so I think that's probably about where we're going to stop but the more 13,000 footers you can do the better is our current view. So that means what we'll be trying to do is configure lease hold where we can to get out to 12,000 or 13,000 feet by doing acreage swaps and other trades.","Arun Jayaram","Great. My final question perhaps for Scott. Scott, you talked about when you get confidence around 50 you could increase your Permian activity by five to ten rigs. What about the Eagle Ford? At what oil price would you contemplate adding or restarting activity in the Eagle Ford?","Scott Sheffield","Yes. We have stated when oil gets to $50, which is an equivalent to the common same price that we would get, so if WDI gets to 50 we would look at restarting Eagle Ford. So we'll have to make a decision at the time if we had 10 rigs for instance and 17, do we take two of those rigs and put in Eagle Ford? For instance, we do have partners there, we have to get approvals on, but I could see us add a couple of rigs in Eagle Ford as a portion of that [indiscernible] rig add.","Arun Jayaram","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, fellas. I'm looking at slide 12, Tim, and obviously very substantial improvement in the cost per foot, but kind of flattened out in the last quarter or so. I'm just wondering if you see \u2013 are we getting to the limits of the improvement now? Or do you think that's got further to go? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.","Scott Sheffield","I think if you're certainly looking an eyeball would say it's flattened out somewhat. It has to do, of course, with the mix of wells we're drilling and where they are and so on but we still have other areas where I think we can reduce our costs. We have \u2013 as I already mentioned, contracts that are peeling off from the standpoint of drilling contractors over this year into next year. And so coming off of what would've been mid-20s day rates into mid-teens is going to be a substantial effect for us. And there's other ancillary things that we're doing as well at the margin.","I think we can reduce our tubular somewhat from this point on as well, at least marginally, maybe 5%. But I think a lot of it will be not just the cost per se from existing contracts and existing supplies but rather continuing interest to improve and this has to do in our case with reducing nonproductive time as an example and we're splitting up both drilling and completions into small pieces to make sure we get can optimize. And so I think you'll start \u2013 you'll see us continuously improve but I think we are reaching more of a flat spot in the curve relative to where we were. You can see dramatic decreases in the early stages of what you would expect and now we're sort of reaching more of an asymptote but with a small decline going forward.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thank you for that. Your comments, Tim, about the choking back for water management and so on, materially enough, you mentioned it in the slide deck. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what that could mean for flattening out decline rates, for example in the areas where you're doing that. I mean, is that just kind of a one-off to deal with this water infrastructure issue? Or is it something that could become more of a policy for Pioneer going forward?","Timothy Dove","It's 100% today related to water, so we're not trying to effect EURs or wells by choking them back. We don't think there's actually any effect from choking wells back would amount to typically two to four weeks while this substantial water flow back period occurs. And So I think essentially what we're trying to do is optimize infrastructure. We could haul off this water but it's such a huge volume of water it creates a logistics problem and it's a minimum of 250 per barrel to do so.","And to go build bigger facilities, we all know the conundrum presented by that, which is we could actually build bigger facilities and they'd only be used for two weeks while we would basically see a decline in the initial production of the well both in terms of water and oil. And so this we think is optimal, it's simply just slightly choke back the wells until the facilities can handle the volumes considering the volumes are substantially higher. I think we'll see less of an effect on this as we get into the second quarter, as I mentioned, simply because we'll be drilling in different areas that won't have as close to existing infrastructure. Of course, that will require infrastructure buildout so there's no free lunches in this infrastructure business.","Doug Leggate","Thanks, Tim. Last one for me, if I may, and, Scott, I apologize for laboring the topic about what oil price you put rigs back to work, but it seems to be topic du jour. I just want to make sure I understood properly. So you're looking more at the strip than anything on the spot it sounds like and I'm just curious is that \u2013 you add a rig let's say tomorrow, when would you expect production contribution given your pod drilling? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, I think we're down to spud to pop of 120 to 130 days, so we used to say six months, so it's down in the four or five month range. So when we add rigs it'll take four to five months and it's a bigger picture for the industry. I think the industry is going to \u2013 we just can't become a big shale swing producer like OPEC thinks just because of the combination of leverage, the amount of people we had to get back to work. It's going to take the industry a good year-and-a-half, two years to get production going again once it starts back up.","Doug Leggate","[Indiscernible] Thanks, Scott. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go now to Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning, guys. Say, I just got a question, I know there's a couple packages, one \u2013 or at least one or two large floating around the Midland. Your thoughts about looking at some of these maybe at least to fill in acreage. I know you certainly don't have a cost-to-inventory issue, so I'm thinking more, Scott, about just filling in acreage. Are these things that you all are looking at?","Richard Dealy","Yes. Our standard is still to look at anything that's contiguous next to our acreage that will extend our laterals. So far, we're only spending $10 million, $20 million a year but if we see something that will definitely improve our laterals from 5000 to 10,000 to 12,000 feet, we'll definitely look at it. The prices people are paying are still fairly strong. So we'll just have to evaluate and see as these deals come through our system.","Neal Dingmann","Okay. Okay. And, Scott, for you \u2013 maybe for you or maybe for Tim. I'm just looking at slide eight. I want to make sure where it does show kind of how you \u2013 you [indiscernible] type curves in the northern Spraberry and Wolfcamp. And especially I'm just looking at that Wolfcamp B, talking about that 35% improvement. Is that pre-sort of all the additional profit along the laterals and all these other things you've already done? I'm just trying to get a sense of that certainly shows strong in all three of those curves, particularly in the Wolfcamp B. I'm wondering is that before some of these other things you've just now started doing?","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, so I would simply say if you look at the completion optimization campaign slide, if you consider what we used to do in 2013 and 2014 is 1.0, it's really the 2.0 case where all those wells were completed using various completion optimization techniques but they did not include any what we call 3.0, which is 2016 campaign.","Neal Dingmann","Wow. Okay. So there's really room to \u2013 I guess the last question I had then, how much until you have the confidence, I mean again, certainly a million barrels is already great EUR. How much more would you have to see or how much more just timing in our data would you have to see to decide to even take those type curves a bit higher?","Frank Hopkins","Hey, Neal. This is Frank. Again, I'll just sort of repeat what I said earlier. I think when you get well into the second half of this year \u2013 I don't know whether it's third quarter or fourth quarter but in some cases the results we have are only, you know, we've only got 90 days of results but everything is looking positive. So give us a couple more quarters, certainly on the Wolfcamp B, and I think we'll be able to declare an increased level, a new EUR, whatever you want to call it there and up the EURs we're building into our forecast. And then with respect to A and the Lower Spraberry shale, we'll be getting a lot more data over the second half of this year, but our data set is not nearly as extensive as we have with the Wolfcamp B. So we're probably looking sometime into 2017 until we get enough confidence there that we want just \u2013 I call it declare a victory.","Neal Dingmann","Certainly. Certainly. Makes sense, Frank. Thanks a lot. Go ahead.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Scott and Tim and to the rest of the team there. I wonder if I could ask a question about the completion optimizations and how far things might go. One way of looking at it is that you could spend a million bucks to bring on \u2013 or for an increment as small as 100,000 barrels and that would still benefit your F&D. And I'm curious, how close is that to the way you guys are analyzing it? And what might be left out of the picture when we look at it that way?","Richard Dealy","I think that's exactly the right math when you consider, Charles that our F&D costs for this part of our business horizontal Wolfcamp Spraberry drilling is roughly about 10. So $10 is a good F&D cost but I think what we're really finding is that increments we're talking about are substantially more than 10% as we're showing in some cases where they're 25%, 35. The real question is as we get to a point here in the 3.0 model that I was referring to, we're already down to 15-foot cluster spacing.","I don't really know how much closer you can get clusters but it's not much closer than that. And I think you're at a point where even pumping profit, even though we're 1700 to 2000 pounds of profit, we see some plays where they've got the 2500, 3000 so we maybe have a little marginal ability to move more that direction but I think the more of the same model is something we're really testing in 2016. You're going to see improvement, I think, out of a lot of those techniques. The issue is going to be once you get past there and you can't really do more of the same because you're limited by space or volume or physics, what do you do there? Then you're probably more into new technology applications, which are little bit unclear today.","Charles Meade","Right. Yeah, I remember you mentioned that earlier in your prepared comments, Tim. And if we could stick on that, your new iteration of the completion design, you talked about the 80 wells in the back half or the remainder of this year. Is there going to be any shift in the mix of those wells versus what we've seen to date? Or should we still expect two-thirds, three-quarters Wolfcamp B will this newest completion design?","Richard Dealy","I don't anticipate the mix of optimally completed wells will change compared to just the totality of the program.","Charles Meade","Great. Thank you for that.","Richard Dealy","See you, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Scott Hanold","Thanks. Good quarter, guys. If I could refer to Page 10, Tim, just to clarify, so on version 3.0 specifically from our seats what should we be looking at in terms of relative productivity to make this an economically feasible plan to move forward? Certainly you're seeing a nice 10% to 35% increase or I guess even on just the Wolfcamp B 35% increase on version 2. Is that the type of increment that you'll need to make that decision on a go-forward basis or what should we look for?","Timothy Dove","I kind of refer back to Charles' question in the sense that version 3.0 has us adding somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million per well. You use a $10 F&D cost, you better feel pretty good that you're getting that kind of percentage increment as well, which is on a well cost basis probably 10%. So you better feel like you're getting at least a 10% bump or you probably wouldn't proceed, but so far our bumps have been substantially higher. Remember back to the Eagle Ford shale, we stopped when we were at a point when we were generating 15% to 30% increments but we're not stopping here.","And the other thing that occurs to me in that question is we're not even talking about spacing. What happened in this field was we began by looking at 500 to 600 foot spacing and we had situations where we had what we thought was too much well interference at a time we were drilling larger half-length wells \u2013 I mean completions. That was really kind of a 1.0 model. Since then, we now find we're completing the wells with more near well bore rock stimulation. That allows for the potential for tightening spacing. So we're now actually testing down to again down to 500 or 600 foot spacing where we had blown it out to 900 to 1000 for that concern regarding interference. So now you're talking about substantial incremental improvements in overall EURs from selected field areas. In other words, your recovery rates go up. So we're not even referring to that, but behind the scenes that's also going on we just don't have any data yet to show you but it's just another thing on the list to hopefully essentially increase EURs.","Scott Hanold","So just to clarify there, 2.0 assumes somewhere 500 or 600. I know it's early, but is that what you're refer to?","Timothy Dove","2.0 \u2013 1.0 is I'd say we tried down to 500 to 600. We saw interference in some wells back in 2013\/2014 to the point we were concerned about it and thought we might be over stimulating the rock and therefore moved out to 800 to 900 foot spacing, some cases 1000 feet. And some of the more recent testing we're doing now, we're moving back to 500 to 600 because we think that the more near well bore rock stimulation campaign is presented by the 3.0 case will allow us to do that. So when we're talking about the moving back to 500 to 600 is actually a 3.0 scenario.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Understood. So of those 80 wells that you're drilling, they will likely be 500 to 600, if I'm hearing you correctly. And could I also ask you can you give us a sense \u2013 are you looking at doing A\/B lower Spraberry all at once or how are you orientating these wells?","Timothy Dove","Well, we still continue to use, on the last part of your question, the drilling a bunch of Wolfcamp BS. You can see the predominance of the wells being drilled and then with the waiting period following up on Wolfcamp A and then it's just going to continue to be the plan. And so I would see that going forward as well.","Scott Hanold","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio","Good morning, guys. A couple of follow-up questions on your rig deployment comments. Fifty is the threshold that relates to your ability to hedge, 50 on the downside. What percentage of 17 do you need to hedge at those levels in order to add rings? Is there trigger level there?","Timothy Dove","We have historically, Evan, gone up to 75% to 85% so it will be somewhere in that range. We're not...","Evan Calio","And now...","Timothy Dove","We're not going to give that what hedge position we're going to put in because there's too many people hedging in the market in this day and time but obviously it'll be hedges trying to collect as close to 50 as we can.","Evan Calio","Right. And that hedge would then allow you to add the first rigs, I guess as the first five cold stacked rigs. Is the next five rigs then up for the ten based upon oil price scenarios S&D outlook?","Timothy Dove","No. The entire five to ten is based on the strip getting to $50 for 17 and also believing that the fundamentals are strong such as inventories are declining. We would not like to add \u2013 it's not ideal to add the rigs at once. We'd like to add two or three one month, two or three the next month, two or three the next month. And so we'll probably have a phase-in time period.","Evan Calio","Great.","Timothy Dove","And we could \u2013 we'd like to also maybe do it later this year, so if we can achieve those fundamental goals and also the oil price goal.","Evan Calio","Great. Any range on vertical integration CapEx increase under a five to ten rig addition program from the 150 this year?","Timothy Dove","I don't think...","Scott Sheffield","Our fleets can handle it right now.","Timothy Dove","Can handle it so I don't think there will be an increase.","Evan Calio","Great. Maybe last for me, if I could. Could you guys discuss any technical challenges that remain to wider deployment of longer lateral versus your 9500 foot standard design? And what percentage \u2013 I appreciate the levels for 2016 but what percentage of those lateral length \u2013 of those longer laterals could be in your 2017 program? Thanks.","Scott Sheffield","The only technical hurdle is the one I mentioned which has to do with the fact that the longer laterals present more of a completion issue than they do anything else. Realize you get far out in the well bore you have hydraulic issues that may be a limiting factor in terms of how well the completions are pumped at the toe. Also, remember we are using still a plug and perf model here for how these wells are completed and so your drill-out campaign becomes much more difficult especially if you're using coil or what have you at that length.","So it really becomes more mechanical on the completions than it does the drilling. I don't really see us out testing much more in terms of lateral length than out there to the 12,000 to 13,000. But as I mentioned, we have probably over 60% of our acreage today is amenable to +10,000 foot drilling. We're going to have 15, probably 10, 15, 20 wells that are out past 10,000. We've got some work to do to really configure more of our lease hold to add that other 40% for long laterals as well.","Evan Calio","Great. So some higher number in 2017, but we'll stay tuned for that.","Scott Sheffield","Yeah, we're heading that way. That seems to be the right economic decision to get as long lateral out there as we can and so I would see us pushing in that direction.","Evan Calio","All right. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ryan Todd","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just one follow-up question on the other side of the rig acceleration. I know you've talked a lot about when you would add rigs, but if we think about on the higher side. What are some of the limits in terms of how much capital you'd want to deploy? I think in the past you've talked about a one-and-a-half time's leverage as kind of a high end of a target. If you think about how much capital you could eventually push into the market, is balance sheet metrics still kind of a limiting factor? Is it \u2013 are there infrastructure limitations or bottlenecks that we should be aware of? Or how are you thinking about your additional to deploy, whether it's five or ten or fifteen or more?","Richard Dealy","Yeah, five to ten first is cash flow. We're going to have a strong cash position by the end of 2016 obviously and then going into 2017, I do expect oil prices to continue to move on up past $50 toward $60 going into 2018. So we'll continue to add rigs. Our cash flow starts getting to a number close to 2 billion plus. You start talking about those types of numbers so we will start paying for ourselves, our rig costs and we'll use the balance sheet. I think it's probably even more important and I think other companies will probably lower their targets. Too many companies were at two, two-and-a-half to one and they got caught with the downturn and they're up to four to five to six to one. And so it's probably even more important for the company to keep the debt-to-cash flow at five to one as a limiting factor going forward.","Ryan Todd","Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe [indiscernible] it feels like a ways away at this point but you've talked in the past about eventually wanting to target cash flow neutrality in the medium term. Is that still a medium term outlook? Is that a long ways away for us to worry about at this point? Or how do you think towards long-term managing to that target?","Richard Dealy","Managing \u2013 say again.","Ryan Todd","Managing to a cash flow neutral position.","Richard Dealy","Yeah, I think if oil prices get back up to 60 and we don't see a \u2013 we see a very small increase in service costs, it depends on how many rigs are being added, that the company can grow within its cash flow at that point time. Once we spend our cash flow and get production up and assuming some small increases in service costs, I think the company can live with any cash flow at that point in time.","Ryan Todd","Great. Congrats, guys. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning. To follow up on a couple of the topics from earlier, first on the longer laterals. What percent of your northern acreage could you today apply 10,000 foot laterals? And can you give us some sense of your expectations for the magnitude of acreage slots you think we could see this year and how much have a greater percentage of your acreage that could open up to longer laterals?","Timothy Dove","Well, I think I've already mentioned, Brian, that about 60% of our current acreage would be amenable to 10,000 foot laterals or more today. We're doing acreage swaps essentially every day or close to it. We have internal goals in that regard. I remind you that one of the more recent deals we did had us swapping out 1200 acres and this is acreage for acreage with no cash changing hands and we added 210,000 feet of laterals. So it's basically \u2013 I think it will be easily something we would look at as a goal to add 2 million feet of laterals as a goal for 2016 and this is just stacking onto our existing acreage position.","Brian Singer","Got it. And the 60% is Northern or total at Permian acreage?","Timothy Dove","I'm speaking more Northern right now because that's the only place we're doing any drilling.","Brian Singer","Got it. Okay. And then if and when it does make sense to start adding five to ten rigs, would the completions associated with the new rigs all be the version 3.0 and would you characterize the wells drilled as more development mode in areas that are all fully tested for the zones you \u2013 for the lower Spraberry A and B? Or would they be more delineation drilling testing new zones in portions of your acreage, testing spacing, et cetera?","Timothy Dove","Well, I'm first going to just say this \u2013 we only have an 80-well campaign going right now on 3.0. So we're not going to make further decisions the expansion of the use of 3.0 until we understand whether it's working and if so at what sort of economic basis that it's working. So to the extent we were to add new rigs, we'd have to kind of hold off and see how 3.0 works. If we think 3.0 works well, then we would absolutely add it to every single well. It would be part of the five to ten rig adds. In terms of the zones, the way I think about this, when I consult with our geo team, we should know with the plethora of data we have vis-a-vis the Wolfcamp B and the 3.0 campaign going on in the B this year, we should pretty much be at a point we will be in full development mode on B at an optimal completion by the end of this year.","But in the case of the Wolfcamp A and then further to the Lower Spraberry shale, we just don't have as much data. So it might be into 2018 before you can really say we are in development mode at the optimal way these wells are to be completed. So I think it's going to be a staggered approach. You can't get all the data every \u2013 today on every single zone at the speed in which we're drilling, but we're trying to accumulate it as fast as we can but I would think Wolfcamp B ready by the end of the year to be on full development mode A and Lower Spraberry shale into 2018 and 2019.","Brian Singer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back to Scott Sheffield for any closing remarks.","Scott Sheffield","Again, we thank everyone for taking their time out. Again, reminding people that we had a great quarter. Looking forward to the next quarter and continuing with our outstanding performance. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."],"17216":["Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Frank E.

Joining us today will be Scott Sheffield, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Dove, President and Chief Operating Officer; Rich Dealy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Hopkins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Pioneer has prepared PowerPoint slides to supplement their comments today. These slides can be accessed over the Internet at www.pxd.com. Again, the Internet website to access the slides related to today's call is www.pxd.com. At the website, select Investors, then select Investor Presentations.","This call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be archived on the Internet site through August 26.","The company's comments today will include forward-looking statements made from -- pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and the business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in Pioneer's news release on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in Pioneer's public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Pioneer's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Frank Hopkins. Please go ahead.","Frank E. Hopkins","Thank you, Marco. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me briefly review the agenda for today's call. Scott is going to be the first speaker. He'll provide the financial and operating highlights for the second quarter of 2013, another strong quarter for Pioneer. He'll then review our capital and production growth outlooks for the remainder of 2013. This will be followed by a recap of our continued strong drilling results in the horizontal Wolfcamp play across Pioneer's extensive northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp acreage position. After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim is going to discuss our drilling plans in the northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, as well as the southern Wolfcamp joint venture area and the Eagle Ford Shale. Rich will then cover the second quarter financials in more detail and provide guidance for the third quarter. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","Before moving on with the call, there is one procedural item I need to cover. Please recall that during May, we announced that Pioneer had submitted a proposal to the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners. The intent is to acquire all of Pioneer Southwest's outstanding publicly held units in exchange for Pioneer common stock. Pioneer is waiting to hear from the Conflicts Committee on this proposal. If such a transaction were to take place, we would be required to file a registration statement with the SEC, and so we will be unable to discuss the proposal during this call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield","Good morning. Thanks, Frank. First slide, we had second quarter 2013 adjusted income of $154 million or $1.10 per diluted share. Second quarter production, 176.2 thousand barrels a day equivalent. When you add back in our 1,400 barrels a day of ethane rejection primarily in our Atlas plants associated with that 177.6 thousand barrels a day equivalent. We're up about 5,000 barrels a day, or 3%, compared to first quarter, driven primarily by horizontal Wolfcamp shale and Eagle Ford shale growth profile.","Second quarter again, production negatively impacted by the unexpected ethane rejection of about 1,400 barrels oil equivalent per day, primarily in our southern area of JV with Atlas. With ethane around $0.25, we need a movement probably another $0.02, $0.03, $0.04 before we see ethane rejection stop [ph].","We're narrowing our production growth guidance range from 12% to 16%, to 14% to 16%. We're tightening that range. Again, very important in our northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program were announced in our first Wolfcamp A. If you remember, we're about 2,000 feet deeper in this area. Very highly successful once again on the Hutt lease, where our first Wolfcamp B was announced several months ago. We had a 24 IP peak rate of over 1,700 barrels a day and a 30-day average rate of a little over 1,100 barrels a day with 74% oil.","In addition, an update on our Wolfcamp B well in Martin County. Our first well there, the Mabee K well which we announced in late May, it had a peak rate 1,572. Again, a new 30-day average production rate of 10,040 (sic) [1,040] with 76% oil.","We had cumulative production from the first Wolfcamp B interval well, the Hutt well, in Midland County. What's interesting, in 6 months, it's reached 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent. If you remember, our typical Wolfcamp -- Spraberry\/Wolfcamp vertical well takes 30 to 35 years to produce a 140,000 on a vertical well. So we did that in 6 months.","What's also interesting in our Hutt lease, which is becoming very popular for us, it's made up about 11,000 acres, 93% net revenue, with 700 potential locations in 6 intervals at about 800,000 barrels. It can eventually yield 0.5 billion barrels just that lease of 11,000 acres net to Pioneer.","Turning to Slide #4, additional highlights. If you remember, we did increase from 1 rig to 5 rigs in the second quarter in our northern Spraberry\/Wolfcamp drilling program. Those additional 4 rigs were primarily late in the second quarter. We're currently drilling multiple zones, both the Wolfcamp, Jo Mill and Spraberry shales. In addition, we're moving 2 rigs to an acreage position pretty much on the Andrews\/Martin County line during the third quarter.","In addition, with the success of the Hutt A well, we are moving up several A wells in the Q for late 2013 and early 2014. We now have 5 horizontal wells on production in the north. They include our 2 Jo Mill wells, which are in the Giddings area. We have 6 wells awaiting on completion and 5 wells currently drilling. So it's pointing toward somewhere between 6 and 11 wells we could report on by the November call.","Our update on our southern Wolfcamp joint venture horizontal drilling. If you remember, we did close our joint venture on May 31. June production was lower by 4,000 barrels a day. Because of that, selling 40% of 10,000 barrels a day or 1,300 barrels a day for the quarter. We placed 22 new Wolfcamp B wells during the quarter with IP rates up to 1,000 barrels a day equivalent. Well results are meeting expectations.","In addition, we're still continuing to lower well cost. As we have mentioned before, we were targeting 7,000-foot laterals. We are now up to 8,300-foot laterals on average. Our well costs are $7.5 million to $8 million.","Total cost. If you look at a 7,000-foot lateral, that puts the total well cost back to about $7 million or less. This does include the benefits of lower slickwater frac, and also our hybrid fracs are being reduced.","In addition with the recent run-up in crude price and especially WTI, over the last 3 weeks, we have significantly increased our hedge positions for finishing up '14, up to 60% in 2015, and from 0 really up to 15% in 2016. And we're continuing to move these coverage ratios up, especially in both '15 and '16 as we speak, again, primarily using 3 ways, protecting the downside with upside.","In addition, with the closing of the joint venture, we now have $700 million cash on hand and our debt-to-book is down from 26% to 22% at end of second quarter.","Slide #5, on our CapEx. The important thing is our CapEx remains the same at $3 billion, so no change. I won't go into any more details on this slide. But essentially, it's being funded with cash flow. We're using $95 oil and $4 gas the rest of this year. Obviously, we're seeing higher prices now. That's generating cash flow of $2.3 billion and again, with $700 million cash on hand.","Going to Slide #6, in regard to our production growth. We are narrowing our guidance range from 175,000 to 181,000, to 177,000 to 181,000. Also, we are bringing out both third and fourth quarter. We'll see a significant jump in fourth quarter, primarily due to the fact that the timing of POPs from pad drilling. We're doing pad drilling in Eagle Ford, pad drilling in our southern JV with Sinochem and also we're doing pad drilling in the north.","In addition, we started our last 4 rigs in the north late of second quarter, so we won't see the impact to those until late third quarter, primarily fourth quarter. That's why you're seeing a big jump, 185,000 to 195,000 range for the fourth quarter of 2013. Again, 62% liquids, moving towards 70% liquids in 2015.","Slide #7 just backs that up of how we got to each of the numbers. The big change again, emphasizing the POPs from both Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford, first half of 93 going to 142 the second half, and most of the ones in the second half are late third quarter and going into the fourth quarter. Again, you see the effects of the Sinochem sale and the ethane rejection going into the third quarter.","Slide #8. Again, the 2 highlights. In yellow is the Hutt A well, Wolfcamp A well coming on at 1,700 barrels a day, located right next to the Wolfcamp B well that's produced over about 140,000 in 6 months. Again, that's on our Hutt lease. The Wolfcamp A, just to remind people, of all the Wolfcamp zones, the Hutt A has more -- I mean, the Wolfcamp A has more oil in place than any other Wolfcamp zone throughout the area. The key really is to contain the frac. We did it on this well, so it opens up -- we're about 2,000 feet deeper, but it opens up potentially the entire Midland County and Martin County, again, for that Wolfcamp A interval.","And also, the Mabee well, 1,570 barrels a day equivalent, 76% oil, again, performing tremendous. The rest of the map shows the other wells that we have been showing, both lower Spraberry Shales, Jo Mills and our Giddings wells that were drilled over almost 2 years ago.","I'm looking at Slide 9. What's interesting is the decline curve on these 3 wells, both the 2 Wolfcamp B wells in Martin and Midland, and then the recent Wolfcamp A well. What's interesting is that the Wolfcamp A well is starting to exceed the potential decline of the original Hutt well Wolfcamp B that's made 140,000 barrels.","A couple of things have happened. We've modified our heater treater. And secondly -- to reduce back pressure. And secondly, we have just recently installed it on gas lip. So we generally anticipate a slight bump. So it'll be interesting to watch, but it is moving past the curve. These 3 wells are way exceeding way above the 650,000 barrel type curve, pointing toward somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million barrels for each of these 3 locations.","Finally, Slide #10, in summary. Again, we have a tremendous asset base. We have over 9 billion barrels. We'll continue to grow that significantly over time as we report the next set of results. The drilling program is focused primarily on liquids-rich areas, both the Eagle Ford, Spraberry vertical and the horizontal Spraberry\/Wolfcamp plays. We have a great growth profile of 15% plus over the next several years. Vertical integration substantially improving execution and returns, great hedge position over the next 3 years and again, a great balance sheet. Let me turn over to Tim to give you more details.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Scott. I'm on Slide 11 now. We are clearly making a lot of good progress in terms of executing on our northern drilling plan in the Permian. You've heard some of that from what Scott had to say. In the next 3 slides, I'm going to cover -- provide a great deal granularity on our plan moving forward.","We've tweaked our current plan slightly. The plan still is to spud 30 to 40 wells this year in 6 different intervals. Each of these intervals, we believe, are prospective on plus or minus or even in some cases, more than 600,000 acres. Now the current plan that's shown on this slide is to drill about -- or spud about 20 to 25 wells in the Wolfcamp, the D, B and A zones. While at same time, we'll be spudding 10 to 15 wells in the Spraberry zones, the middle and lower Spraberry shale, as well as the Jo Mill. So this will be the subject of the 5-rig campaign, targeting spudding those 30 to 40 wells in 6 different zones.","Costs have been coming in at about $7.5 million to $8.5 million in the north for 7,000-foot laterals. Of course, it is deeper in the north than it is in the south. Now we continue to spend money in the sense of science and facilities for these new wells. That is to say, micro-seismic in most every case, drilling pilot holes, taking cores and using sophisticated long suites. The idea of being gathering data so that we progress into appraisal and we'll have all that behind us.","Turning now to Slide 12. The map here shows the general areas we're going to be drilling and specifically, they're shown by the red stars on the graph. Those are in Midland and Martin and soon to be, east Andrews County. Scott alluded to this, where 2 rigs will be heading up there. It's about 15 miles northwest of the Mabee horizontal well in Martin County.","Specifically, though, going forward, we'll have 3 rigs focused on Wolfcamp shale drilling in Midland and Martin Counties and 2 rigs focused on Jo Mill and Spraberry shales in those same counties. And then after that, we'll be moving a couple of those rigs during the third quarter to drill Wolfcamp and the Spraberry shale wells in Andrews County. We continue to move much more towards pad drilling to gain the efficiencies associated with that. Of course, it leads to delays when you look at it from a standpoint of spudding the first well to putting both wells on production. We currently calculate that to be about 120 to 150 days, in this case, longer than usual, simply related to the fact we have all that extra science to do in the early stages of the project.","And this leads to -- as you know, when you look at the rest of our peers, we're in a similar situation with pad drilling. It leads to a relatively lumpy production profile, which we are depicting later in my presentation. Suffice it to say, we're well on the way to executing this $400 million program for this year and looking at adding 3 more rigs next year.","Pretty clearly, though, when you look at this area, production will be skewed to the later part of the year due to pad drilling.","Now I'm going to turn to Slide 13 and this is a lot of granularity, but it does show the effect of pad drilling and the details of where these pads are going to be drilled and by zone for the second half of the year. And we expect to add about 20 new wells on production in the second half of the year. Again, a lot of that is back-weighted towards the fourth quarter as you can see. Each of these bars represent 2 wells. As you can see, for example, the Wolfcamp B and D, that's 2 wells over a couple of quarters being drilled. You'll see on the lower part of the graph, we have about 6 wells. So there's 3 bars effectively coming on production during the third quarter, which we will be able to talk about in the November call and perhaps, a few more depending upon the exact timing. And I would -- concurrently, the thinking is we would have a minimum of 6 wells on production just, again, due to the effect of pad drilling. So out of the 20, you'll see more information as we get into the first quarter. And it's very clear to me, we'll be seeing a lot more data on the early northern well results as the next couple of quarters transpire.","Turning then to Slide 14. The southern Wolfcamp drilling campaign is in full swing with 7 rigs running. We put 22 new Wolfcamp B wells on, as Scott has already mentioned, with very strong expectations, and those came in along the lines of those expectations, up to 1,000 BOE per well and very high oil content importantly. We've already mentioned the fact that slickwater fix -- slickwater fracs have a very significant benefit from a cost standpoint. We also are reducing the cost of our hybrid gel fracs by using less expensive chemicals and changing how the wells are completed in terms of the number of clusters per stage and so on. And so we're seeing benefits to reduce cost whether we use gel or slickwater, and the results seem to be the same in terms of the productivity of the wells.","Again, the plan is to move from about 7 rigs this year to 10 rigs next year and so on, increasing after that. We're well on target to drill our 86 wells this year. As you look to the second half of the program, we will be testing multiple Wolfcamp zones, the A, B and D. As Scott already mentioned, our costs are coming in basically as expected, about $7.5 million to $8 million for the 8,300 average lateral.","We are in the process of extending laterals. We have about 20 wells, maybe even slightly over 20, that we'll be drilling in 2013 to somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 feet. The economics still support this lengthening in a significant way, with about 20% increase in cost generating a substantial increase in EURs, estimated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% to 60%. And we'll be doing about 70% pad drilling in the south.","Typically, it's 3 wells in the south and that puts your spud-to-POP length out to about 150 days. Again, you expect to see as a result of that lumpy production growth as we get into the third and fourth quarter, with a lot of the production increase is skewed into the fourth quarter.","A real important note here, although we don't give a lot of information on it, is the fact that we're testing downspacing using staggered interval drilling in both the upper B and lower B. All of the resources that are discussed in our investor relation materials are based on 140-acre spacing. This testing is now being done at 80 acres and we see no reason to believe that won't work, but we're testing it as we speak. We'll have much more to say about that over the next couple of quarters.","Now turning to Slide 15. The result of all this activity is continuing growth in the Permian basin. As you can see, we produced about 80,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter. Of course, that was negatively affected by the ethane rejection Scott mentioned. But the fact is we are tightening our range to the upside for the Permian basin up to about 77,000 to 80,000 barrels equivalent per day this year compared to our prior range of 75,000 to 80,000.","We do have the new gas processing plant on in Driver. But in addition, a new plant has been announced by our partner for the addition of another 100 million cubic feet a day in the second half of 2014 and another 100 in the first part of 2015. So we're well ahead of taking care of our needs when it comes to gas processing for future production.","We do continue to use 15 vertical rigs. As you know, we need to meet continuous drilling obligations in order to preserve our leasehold, both vertical and horizontal leasehold. We did drill about 73 vertical wells in the second quarter and have now brought our frac back down to minimum levels, I think, put about 90 wells on production. Almost every single one of those wells will be deepened to the Strawn and the Atoka and so on.","And just as I showed for the northern pad drilling, we see the same effects in the south in terms of the effects of production, hitting more in the fourth quarter than it does in the third. Overall, we expect horizontal production from the Permian to increase from about 2,000 barrels a day last year to a range of 11,000 to 14,000 this year depending upon the exact timing of bringing wells on production.","Turning to Slide 16. Eagle Ford Shale now is effectively a well-oiled machine for Pioneer. You can see that we continue to set new production records. We drilled 33 wells in the second quarter, on target to drill the 130 wells that were planned this time this year, drilling with only 10 rigs, while drilling the same number of wells we drilled with 12 rigs last year. In the Eagle Ford, we are typically in the range of 2 to 6 wells per pad. We're that much more further advanced in terms of the development here after now being in the play 3 to 4 years. The average perhaps is about 100 to 120 days spud-to-POP time for a 3-well pad. But it does save substantially in terms of the per-well cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $600,000 to $700,000 per well. It's become a recurring theme. For the third time, I'll tell you we'll see some lumpy production growth as a result of that, as we substantially ramp up our pad drilling. And you can see our production in the fourth quarter will be growing because a number of wells we POP-ed at the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter will increase compared to earlier in the year.","As I'm also mentioning in the southern Wolfcamp, we're also testing downspacing in the Eagle Ford. Our original planning on Eagle Ford had us at about 115-acre spacing. We're now testing 40-acre spacing, especially in some of the more oily areas. We'll have more to say about that after we get the results in the next couple of quarters. And we're also similarly extending laterals, now trying 10,000-foot laterals compared to our recent averages of more like 5,500 feet. And so what we're doing, of course, is expanding our knowledge base and continually improving and hopefully, continually improving the economics. One way to do that is to use more white sand. We have about 75% of our program using white sand, and the results look very strong and they substantially are reducing our frac cost. Now the estimate is over $1 million savings by directing white sand to the completions.","Well costs are well stabilized in the neighborhood to $7 million to $8 million. So I'm going to stop there. And in essence, what I can tell you is the execution in our assets is at a high level and should lead to the future performance that will be very solid.","With that, I'm going to pass it over to Rich for a review of the second quarter financials and third quarter outlook.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim. I'm going to start on Slide 17. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $337 million or $2.40 per diluted share for the quarter. It did include unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains of $66 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Also included, unusual items, aggregating $117 million or $0.83 per diluted share, primarily made up of the southern Wolfcamp JV gain that we had recognized on that transaction when it closed at the end of May. So adjusting for those items, we're at $154 million or $1.10 per diluted share.","Looking at the middle of page where we show our second quarter guidance and then the results, how they actually came out, you'll see that we're within guidance. On all the items, we're on the positive side of guidance. As you scan down there, you'll see that. I'm not going to through those, but they're there for your review.","Turning to Slide 18, price realizations. You'll see that our oil price realization improved by 3% relative to the first quarter, up to $90.82. This is primarily driven by the differential between Midland and Cushing coming down during the second quarter. If you look at NGL prices, we are down 7% to $28.19. This is primarily driven by the heavy end of the NGL stream, the butanes and natural gasoline prices coming down during the quarter. And then, as you're aware, gas prices were up 19%.","Looking at the bottom of this slide, we did have cash derivative settlements that were positive during the quarter on all our products. And so they added income representing $1.07 to oil, $0.12 per barrel on NGLs and $0.71 per Mcf on gas.","Turning to Slide 19 to look at production costs. You can see we're very consistent with both the first quarter and the fourth quarter. Costs have been coming in flat so no significant changes here and expected to continue into the future.","Turning to Slide 20. Look at our liquidity position. The company, as Scott talked about, has a very strong financial position. We have net debt of $2.1 billion, strong liquidity position at $696 million of cash on hand and a $1.5 billion undrawn credit facility. You can see from the table in the middle that we have no near-term bond maturities and the company is in excellent financial condition.","Turning to Slide 21, third quarter guidance. Scott talked about production guidance of 174,000 to 179,000 BOEs per day in the third quarter increasing to 185,000 to 195,000 BOEs a day in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the timing of bringing wells on associated with pad drilling. So that's there. The rest of these items are very consistent with past quarters. So rather than go in to those in detail, I'll leave them there for your review and stop here, and we'll go ahead and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Ryan Oatman with SunTrust.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the prospectivity of this Wolfcamp A across your acreage based on what you've seen? And how similar is that zone's prospectivity compared with, say, the Wolfcamp B map that you've published?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the Wolfcamp A is pretty much -- like the Wolfcamp B, it's pretty much our entire 900,000 acres. And the Wolfcamp A, as I mentioned, has the most oil in place of the Wolfcamp member benches. There is a lower Spraberry shale that has more oil in place, which we're in the process of testing over the next several weeks. The Wolfcamp A, if you remember, we've had some good results to the south. We've been focused more on the B. This Wolfcamp A happens to be about 2,000 feet deeper. So a combination of better pressure and staying -- and our frac zone staying pretty much in zone, the entire frac stage -- several stages is probably the reason why we're seeing such great performance. And so, as I said also, we're going to be moving up several more wells in the Wolfcamp A in the northern 600,000 acres by late '13, first half of '14 end of the Q.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then conceptually, how should we think about the Jo Mill versus the lower and middle Spraberry? Do you see those as separate zones that you can target? Or do you think you'll be able to attack some of these with same wellbore, say, with the lower kind of frac-ing up into the Jo Mill?","Scott D. Sheffield","Now there's enough separation between all 3. The middle Spraberry shale, the Jo Mill shale and the lower Spraberry shale, they're both -- all 3 very thick. There's enough separation between all the 3 that we don't anticipate any of the fracs to go into the other zone. So we are using micro-seismic on all of the Spraberry shale tests and we're testing now, so we'll have better results. We're just now in the process of completing and frac-ing some of our first wells in both Martin and Midland County in the next few weeks.","Ryan Oatman - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last one for me. Moving the 2 out of the 5 rigs over to Andrews County, can you talk about what has you encouraged there and what zones you plan to target?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the -- we're targeting the -- both the Wolfcamp B and the Wolfcamp D are the primary zones. We do have some leases expiring in the area. That's one of the reasons we're moving over there. They're pretty much on the Andrews\/Martin County line. We don't have a large position. If you continue to move west, obviously, the acreage sort of plays out. That's why we don't have a lot of acreage way west of that, but it does set up several thousand acres in Andrews. In addition, it sets up our northern acreage in Martin County.","Operator","Next we hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is getting all very interesting. I wonder if I could just try a couple of questions, please. The A well is substantially better it looks like than several of the B wells you drilled in the results given so far. Is there anything particular unique about the A in terms of well design? Or are we really just looking at significant upside risk to your type curve guidance?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, I think, again, the job [ph] just told us originally that the A zone has the most oil in place and I think that there's a lot of oil in place. I'm hoping that's the reason why we're seeing the flattening. And so hopefully, the amount of oil in place in the Wolfcamp A is allowing the well to flatten sooner than the other 2 wells. We need more data time. But it looks like it is moving towards that 1 million barrels of oil equivalent. We did not really do anything different. The 2 wells were about 700 feet apart between the 2 Hutt wells. So that's why we're excited about it, and we're going to drill several more.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got a couple of follow-ups, if I can just try these. So you're -- I think if I recollect, you're talking about an average-type curve in the north of 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Can you help us just to reconcile that number relative to -- obviously, it's early days, but help us reconcile why you've still got such what looks like a low estimate? And I've got a follow-up please.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, as you know, now we only have 3 wells. They're starting to obviously show much higher than the 650,000. As I mentioned, 800,000 to 1 million, so I think we're going to have some pretty good data points really now and the end of the year to officially increase that type curve at some point. Doug, so just be patient with it.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you mean the 650,000 or the 500,000 because I think your guidance is still 500,000?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we're showing you the 650,000 and these 3 wells are doing way above the 650,000. So we will be increasing it obviously some time by the end of the year or early next year.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great stuff. Last one for me, 10,000-foot laterals in the south, is that now a sustainable well design? And I'll leave it there.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we've done it many, many times now over, I think, 10 wells. And so accordingly, I think we have no risk in terms of the well design. We're used to doing it now.","Operator","Next is Gil Yang with DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Could you guys comment on -- did you see any interference between the A and the B wells? Did the A frac into the B in any way? It doesn't look like it on the production curve.","Scott D. Sheffield","No, almost all the entire frac stayed pretty much in zone on the Wolfcamp A.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Gil, one real quick, just one note is that we had that Wolfcamp B well off when we frac-ed the Wolfcamp A well. We've put that Wolfcamp B well back on. It basically came back to its rates before we turned it off. So that's indicative of a noninterference situation.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Sure, great. Was there any indication that frac fluid went from the A well into the B well?","Timothy L. Dove","No.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. Does that suggest -- is the 700-foot distance between the 2, the spacing assuming 140 acres or is it more indicative of maybe 80 acres?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, 700 feet -- it's really you have to look at along the lines of what the depth is, right? These -- the A and the B zones were drilled probably 3 -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 400 feet difference in depth and 700 feet apart from map view [ph]. So these wells, in that sense, are completely different zones, completely different areas. They're being drilled and completed.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. I understand you're doing the pad drilling to optimize on costs. Is there any hope that you might get synergistic frac-ing if you put the wells closer together?","Timothy L. Dove","Well I think what we're going to see is we'll continue to use zipper fracs as a way to, number one, reduce cost, but also I think the current thinking from our geos and reservoir engineering teams is that zipper fracs can actually potentially lead to a much more complex fracture structure. And so we tend to see when we do zipper fracs from these pads that the well results are better than when you just do one-off completions. And probably, that's what's it's related to. But we're doing a lot of work to understand that question.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Great, all right. And last question for me. Is it -- it seems like you shifted a little bit of activity in terms of the number of wells you're expecting away from the Jo Mill, Spraberry towards more the Wolfcamp drilling. Could you -- maybe about 5 wells out of 15 to 20. Can you just comment on sort of what you're thinking is there?","Timothy L. Dove","I'd say there's no information on that whatsoever. Basically, it's just a matter of which wells are scheduled. It has to do with which wells we can get permitted and built. So there is no information in there at all regarding a choice. It's simply a matter of the way the schedule is playing out.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Kistler, Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Following up a little bit on Gil's question with respect to interval drilling, can you talk a little bit about what your plans are going forward in the north for testing the different intervals and communication between them? Or is over the next, call it, year or 1.5 years really predicated more towards just de-risking individual intervals and then figuring out whether there's communication later?","Timothy L. Dove","Well what you see us doing, if you take a look at some of the minutia on Slide 13 is we're actually testing sort of the notion of whether there is any interference. So if, for example, we're pairing up wells in the Wolfcamp B and D in some circumstances and several of the bars I showed you that we show a Wolfcamp B and D. So we'll know a lot more about spacing on the one hand and then the possibility of interference on the other, which are linked, obviously. But by the same token, we're doing the same thing where we're drilling Jo Mill section, as well as Spraberry section. As you can see in a couple of cases, we have a situation where we drill a Jo Mill and a lower Spraberry; a Jo Mill and -- actually, in a lower Spraberry with a middle Spraberry. So we're actually testing all of these concepts of understanding the nuances associated with which interval we complete within and the effects on other intervals. Right now, we really don't expect anything in the way of interference. We've got such a large section here. You have 3,000 to 3,500 foot of shales here. So we can I think effectively complete in various different intervals without much effect to others.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then switching back to the A interval for a moment and your comments on the ability to keep that frac in place. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of learnings took place there. I know that was a challenge you guys were looking to overcome and successfully did on the quarter. But do you feel like you've got the recipe and the confidence dramatically increased for being able to execute that? Any kind of color you can give us around that would be helpful.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I think I'll make one point. We are 2,000 feet deeper than the southern JV area. And secondly, there is a very, very tight formation, the Dean formation, which we have completed vertically over the last 30 years. But it's probably the tightest zone, so it's very, very tight. It's a -- and some of our concerns over the past that do we frac up into the Dean and we're really not frac-ing in the Dean. It's so tight that the A frac pretty much all stayed in zone. So that's highly encouraged.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And mainly because it seems like Permian is stealing the show here. Maybe switch to Eagle Ford just for a moment. Obviously, execution continues to be strong there. Some of your peers have been putting a significantly larger amount of proppant in place and driving pretty staggering production rates. Will you guys be experimenting with that going forward?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we have multiple pilots going on to study various aspects of how to improve the completions. And one of them is, as you said, increasing the amount of proppant used. Also looking at configurations of the number of stages that are pumped and also how we actually perforate within those stages, how many clusters and so on. All that work is being done in a pilot sense. In fact, we started that early this year. We should know a lot about those results by the end of this year. The results look very positive, though, to basically pump more proppant. That's getting pretty clear to us. And so that's, I think, the direction we're going.","Operator","Next is Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Your medium-term growth guidance calls for about 15% midpoint at about a $95 oil price. As we've seen the recoverable resources for Pioneer increase with each successful horizontal test in the Permian, should we think about this increased resource as just providing more years of 15% growth or should we think about upside to that growth rate? And then perhaps you could also add how that dovetails with what we should expect from a CapEx cash flow perspective once the drilling carries run out?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I think that's obviously our target over the next several years, Brian. I think the big upside to it is that we were still not modeling wells coming on 1,600 to 1,800 barrels a day. We were modeling wells in the north coming on 800 to 1,000 barrels a day, IP rates. And so if we -- we need more data before we change that model. Also, we're waiting for the results on the 3 Spraberry zones to the north and then we're going to be reallocating capital to the best returns of these 6 intervals. So we -- at this point in time, we don't know which of the 6 are going to be the best. We know Wolfcamp B and A are very good. So the Spraberry wells are going to have to really perform and be drilled at a lower cost to compete with the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B. But we'll know all those answers over the next several months. But the key driver and the key upside to move toward a higher growth rate, ignoring commodity prices, is whether or not we change the IP rates and continue to deliver wells coming on 1,600 to 1,800 barrels a day to the north. And that'll be the big swing factor in our long-term growth rate for the company.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then going back to the Wolfcamp A, you highlighted that your expectation in the oil in place for the A zone exceeds the other zones, particularly the B zone. How do we think about that in the context of the 2 Hutt C wells that have been drilled here with similar lateral lengths, in which the 30-day rate from the B well exceeds the A well? I know these are just 2 wells, but do you expect a lower decline coming from the A well and therefore, a higher EUR or just a lower recovery rate? Or is there some greater opportunity for further downspacing within the A?","Scott D. Sheffield","As you can see on Slide #9, the well pretty much averaged both the Mabee well and Martin county, and the Hutt Wolfcamp A well pretty much stayed similar performance below the level of the Hutt Wolfcamp B well. It's -- we only have probably 10 days of data to show that the Wolfcamp A well is acting above these [ph]. So we need more data at this point in time. So if you had asked me 10 days ago, we were putting the Wolfcamp B Hutt well as the best well. So we need more data to see whether or not this Hutt Wolfcamp A well is going to end up doing better.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Based on -- your hypothesis though, it would be that similar lateral lengths and similar well types will end up with a higher EUR in the A versus the B, assuming you can frac it correctly.","Scott D. Sheffield","Potentially. So it's showing that right now, but we need more data. We need more time.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to focus a little bit on the rig ramp in the northern Midland Basin. You guys are at 5 now. You talked about going to 8 for next year. When would you guys expect to be at 8? Would that be kind of very early next year? And would 8 be more of an average rig count in the north for next year?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Leo, I think what we're going to do is have 3 more rigs basically hot on January 1, and that means we'll average 8 for the year.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of well cost, you guys talked about $7.5 million to $8.5 million. I get a clue [ph] that's kind of where you're at now without science. I mean, where do you think these costs could go over time as you hopefully start drilling a lot more of these and you are able to drill them faster and optimize your pad drilling in your fracs here? What kind of downside do you think there could be to that well cost, assuming, say, flat service costs over the next year or 2?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, one thing I can tell you is in all of these shale plays, you tend to see efficiencies that are brought to bear after -- with time and continuous improvement. Use Eagle Ford as an example where our days on wells have come down dramatically. It's not unusual to see 20% reduction as the number of days on wells. So that's not an exact 20-day -- sorry, 20% effect on total cost because completions also have a big component of that. But the fact is if we're drilling a lot longer laterals also -- we'll also potentially add increased costs. So there's a mixed bag on this answer. It has to do with efficiencies we can wring out of the system, which we'll do in the combination of pad drilling, new completion concepts, but it also be offset to the extent we're going with longer laterals.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, just going over to the southern Wolfcamp, trying to get a sense of how many non-B zone wells you guys have brought on production at this point?","Timothy L. Dove","I'm going to look around the table and get the answer to that question. How many non-B zone?","Scott D. Sheffield","It's about 5 to 10.","Timothy L. Dove","Right in that area.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And I guess, can you maybe just discuss a little bit about the performance of those other zones versus the B in the southern area?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I think most of those, Leo -- in the Wolfcamp A. We have 2 or 3 good wells in the Wolfcamp A. And remember, we had a couple that we frac-ed up. We didn't have 3D seismic. We frac-ed up some faults and then we had a very good lower -- the Wolfcamp B expands to about 600 to 700 feet in the south, and we have some good lower Wolfcamp B wells. And we'll still continue to drill those. We think the Wolfcamp B could be developed with 2 wells.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, to clarify that point, most of the wells that are being completed in the Wolfcamp B were actually the what we call the Wolfcamp B2 zone. So the deeper B3 is what we're referring to some new concepts for completions, and you're probably heading towards stacked B laterals as we move forward.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess in terms of the A zone, you mentioned that some -- you're frac-ing the faults. One is good, but it sounds like you have some good wells. I mean, do you feel that the A is pretty consistent across your southern acres and those are really just sort of mechanical issues on those couple of wells that weren't as good? And how would you compare to the A to the B results in the south in terms of recoveries?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, they're both very similar. We're just trying to make sure that we don't have any of the issues we've had frac-ing in the faults like we've had. So we're making sure we finish the 3D seismic. We're focused on the B now. We're eventually going to drill some D wells in the JV area also. That should be coming up late this year, early next year. So we're still optimistic about the A and the D also. And we'll eventually have a couple of areas with the Wolfcamp C in the JV area also.","Operator","Arun Jayaram, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, is next.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim or Scott, I was just trying to see if you could help me a little bit with a little bit of a mental picture of the A and B well in the Hutt lease. You mentioned they were drilled about 700 feet apart, but just trying to understand, were the wells essentially drilled parallel to each other?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes. So the way to think about it, they're essentially 700 feet apart parallel in plan views. So when you look down at the map, they essentially are parallel. But in a depth sense, so obviously, the A is shallower than the B. The A well is drilled somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 400 feet above the B well.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the first completion, was that in the upper Wolfcamp B?","Timothy L. Dove","When you get up there, the B zone becomes thinner, and by thin, I mean 400 feet. So it's not really thin. It's just not as thick as it is in the south that we were discussing earlier where you have the opportunity for stacked laterals. So the B zone at 400 feet means probably it's one horizontal there and similar thickness in the A.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Tim, have you put any of the 3 wells yet on pumps yet? And if not, about what timing do -- would you plan to put them on the pumps?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, normally, what we're doing is we're flowing [ph] these wells for a while, then pretty soon thereafter, put them on gas lifts. So these wells are generally speaking -- have been on gas lift. At the point at which the pressures in the well reduced to a point where it makes sense and fluids in the well, we then -- we'll go to basically rod lifts or rod pumps.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. The next one, just as you shift up into Andrews County, how does the geology change? I know it's a little bit northwest of the Mabee well. Does the geology change much as you shift a little bit north?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, we see no change that's why we're moving up there. As Tim mentioned, 15 miles from the Mabee well. We see no change in the Wolfcamp B that we targeted. That's why we're moving up there.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just my final question, Scott. You had a pretty provocative set of numbers around the Hutt lease. You talked about 11,000 acres and perhaps a 0.5 billion barrels of potential just on 11,000 acres. Could you help us as walk through how you arrived at that math in terms of the different zones and...","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I just took -- take 800,000 barrels per zone, 700 locations and 93% net revenue.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Fair enough. I suspect Mr. Hutt is pretty pleased with those numbers.","Scott D. Sheffield","The Hutt family is very well compensated [ph]. I'm glad it's only a 7% royalty.","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Meade, Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","If I could bang on the difference a little bit more between the Hutt 1 and the -- or the Hutt 1H and the Hutt 2H. I'm wondering if maybe you can add some detail on what the total fluid you got back in those wells in their early days were? And I guess, what I'm wondering is if perhaps you got more of your frac load more back quickly in the A and that might explain the 30-day rate being lower but the spot rate at 60 day being higher?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Charles, this is Tim. I'm going to have to dig out that data. Why don't you call us back and we'll be able to give you more color on that. I simply don't have it here in front of me.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","All right. No problem. Then as a second question, on the -- I mean maybe you guys did this by design, but I noticed you didn't have one of the slides that I was most looking forward to, which showed the one that -- I think, last quarter, you showed the Jo Mill, those 2 Jo Mill laterals and how they had to continue to performing. And I wonder if you could maybe just offer some comments on how those wells are holding up?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, they are still holding up just like we had shown before. So no change. We just thought it was old data, so that's why we haven't updated but it's very, very positive.","Timothy L. Dove","Those wells, Charles, are -- actually, it's performing very well, in general, average about 50,000 to 60,000 barrels already produced in about 3\/4 of a year or maybe 10 months or so. Now realizing that it was thought in the traditional vertical wells that Jo Mill would produce 20,000 barrels in 40 years. So it just goes to show you and the micro-seismic confirms that we frac-ed up into Jo Mill shale and that's what's leading to the incremental production. But it's about 650 to 60,000 barrels in about 10 months, which is pretty phenomenal. The other thing to know is, Charles, it's short laterals. Those were 2,500-foot laterals. You start [ph] laying out to 5,000-foot laterals, which is the next set of Jo Mill are going to be 5,000-foot laterals. Now you're talking about pretty substantial upside.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the Wolfcamp A, I mean, I know internally, you'd always thought that was probably your best zone and the only issue that you all ever thought might face, as Scott alluded to, is the issues with the previous sort of vertical Dean completion. So I just -- just to clarify, Scott, on your comments, it was a nonevent on this recent well and then what you all have done in the south on the 2 or 3 wells that were the A, was that exact same experience that Dean was not an issue?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, the Dean wasn't really the issue with the south either. It's really frac-ing up faults before we had 3D.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then when I think about what you're doing on the pad drilling side, with the 2-well pads in the north and the 3-well pads in the south, should I sort of assume that next year in the north, that probably moves closer to what you're doing in the south, with like a 3-well pad? And then longer term, should I use kind of what you all have done in the Eagle Ford as sort of the game plan and ultimately, this goes to like 5, 6 wells per pad?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, we will be adding more wells to the pad just like we are in the south JV area, probably not as quick starting in early '14, more like late '14 going into '15, '16.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then the last question for me, you all have worked down the other vertical frac bank by about 72 wells in the first half of the year. Could you just give me what the absolute number is of the wells that are currently where the vertical frac bank stands?","Timothy L. Dove","That'd be 40, John.","Operator","Michael Hall with Heikkinen Advisors is next.","Michael Hall","I guess, most of mine have been answered at this point. But I guess, just to beat a dead horse to some extent, but just to be clear, in terms of how the 3 wells that are highlighted on Slide 9 were produced and in terms of when they are put on lift and that sort of thing, is there -- were there any material differences in those 3?","Scott D. Sheffield","I think the only thing that you can -- we don't have the exact dates, but you can see on the -- I did mention that the red curve, which is the Wolfcamp A well, we don't know -- their field people don't know the difference of the pickup between the gas lift versus modifying the heater treater. So that's why we need to watch it a little bit longer to see the performance of it. But generally, they're all -- they all 3 start flowing, they go to gas lift and probably, these wells are good enough. They'll probably a good -- I'm guessing 18 months to 2 years before they even consider pumping units.","Michael Hall","Great, that's helpful. Appreciate it. And then on the Spraberry shales, I know -- I think if I recall in the past, you've talked about Jo Mill shale is having somewhat of a limited lateral length to them. Is that the same in kind of all the Spraberry shales or is that really just going to be the Jo Mill?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, right now, we're starting out -- we are -- the Spraberry shales are going into a more depleted area. So we have about 18,000 wells as we had mentioned. Most of them have penetrated the Spraberry shales, not perforated the Spraberry shales but have penetrated. So we do have lower pressure. And so most of our wells right now are going at about 5,000 feet, a little bit more than 5,000 feet are Spraberry shales. For the Wolfcamp, we're going out longer, 7,000 to 10,000. But right now, our initial wells are in this 5,000, maybe a little bit higher than the Spraberry shales to start off with.","Michael Hall","Okay. And then is that sort of a natural limit of any sort or might those 5,000-foot laterals move up to 7,000 foot?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, we're being careful. We think we can go out longer over time.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question for me. In terms of the Eagle Ford, just hoping to get a little bit of color on how you guys think about inventory depth, especially with some of the downspacing pilots you're running currently, and then how you think about the acceleration potential or how you feel about your drilling program in the play, assuming that inventory does move up.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think, first of all, you're correct to the extent that some of these areas that we're talking about drilling and testing to 40 acres. To the extent that's successful, which we believe it will be, it will dramatically increase our amount of inventory we have to drill in the future. I will tell you that the inventory we have is somewhat dependent upon how many gas wells we want to drill. Today, we are essentially drilling no dry gas wells. But when it comes to the oilier sections of the play, it could literally add hundreds of wells to the inventory by going to 40-acre spacing.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And as we think about the relative economics of that play and how it competes for capital on a go-forward basis, especially if there is an acceleration case versus the Wolfcamp, could you just give us a little color there and then how we should think about capital allocation?","Timothy L. Dove","Well I think through time, it's clear the Eagle Ford Shale wells -- because of how productive they are, especially earlier in their lives -- are some of our best economics. They were clearly better and then our vertical Spraberry trend drilling economics for some time, and that's why it was the case -- it made sense to move a lot of capital into that play. Now as we look forward to horizontal Wolfcamp drilling, it appears in the early stages that you get a significant amount of capital efficiency from horizontal Wolfcamp and potentially these other zones such that their economics could be as good or even slightly better than the Eagle Ford. But I think the Eagle Ford will always be competitive because you have such prolific wells, such high-rate wells and such high EURs per well that it's always going to be competitive even probably compared to these horizontal wells. Now if you're talking about 1 million barrel wells that are drilling oily prospects compared to, let's say, a more gassy Eagle Ford well, then you'd probably come to the view that the horizontal Wolfcamp wells could exceed the economics of the Eagle Ford.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joseph Allman with JP Morgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in the southern area, the JV acreage, you mentioned you've got -- you put 22 new wells online and the IP rate was up to a 1,000 barrels a day. What was the average of those 22 wells in terms of IP rate?","Timothy L. Dove","It was about 700 or so, realizing that in this particular quarter, the wells that we put on production had a mix of wells and it had a larger mix than we would normally expect of wells being drilled in the southern part of the acreage and that was an effort to make sure we could hold that leasehold. As you know in the southern part of the acreage, the EURs are lower than they are in the north, and so our average results this quarter were as expected, they were expected to come in on average below last quarter's averages only because of the fact it's the mix of wells we're drilling. And so I think it came in essentially on plan. As we look to the second half of the year, we will be much more heavily focused on northern acreage drilling. So you should get back to more of the higher EURs and\/or IPs as you look towards our results in the second half.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Tim, when you talk about mix of wells, what characteristics are you talking about?","Timothy L. Dove","Well I'm talking about IP rates and what we think ultimate reserves or resources are going to be per well.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. So in the southern, I think, you're using -- what are you using? 575,000 barrels of oil equivalent for an EUR average? Is that -- so are the wells so far holding up to that?","Timothy L. Dove","Absolutely. I think the question is, again, has to do with the mix of the wells. Some of the areas in the north, of course, where we've drilled the Giddings wells. Those wells clearly are exceeding 650,000 barrels. You go maybe to the various southern part of the acreage, you have maybe something more towards 400,000 or 450,000. So when we say 575,000, it's intended to encompass kind of an average across the whole acreage position, realizing as you go north, the results improve.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just in the play overall, especially in the northern section, how much of your -- how much is lease exploration driving the timing of your drilling?","Timothy L. Dove","Well it's certainly driving a good bit of our timing this year. However, as I mentioned, when we were talking about this during -- going through the slides, we really now heavily heading more towards pad drilling and it will be focused on the north. So the southern drilling really was just that intention to make sure we can preserve the leasehold. As we go forward, very little of the drilling campaign will be directed by lease preservation.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Because as you do some of that drilling to the northwest of your northern acreage, it seems that some of that acreage is not as blocky as the stuff kind of more in the central and southern parts. So what's the reason for going over there and testing that part?","Timothy L. Dove","Are you talking about the Andrews County or what...","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I'm talking about Andrews County because that seems less blocky than some of the other acreage you've got. Is that -- is lease exploration driving that drilling?","Timothy L. Dove","Well let me just say this. What we're doing is drilling a well that's basically in western Martin County. I mean it's basically on the line between Andrews and Martin. And what we're doing is we're, in a sense, connecting the dots. So to the extent we drill a good well on this acreage, which we believe we will, then what we do is we prove up that 15-mile corridor up through the northwestern part of Martin County in essence. And so you're right. I mean it is to the western extent of our acreage position, but that's the objective is to connect the dots all the way to the edge of our acreage.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then lastly, just when you look at the whole company and you look at the potential to get to be free cash flow positive. Based on your current plan, when do you see Pioneer becoming free cash flow positive?","Scott D. Sheffield","We have so much opportunity that we can probably just dial in our own growth rate over the next several years. So we're not driving to free cash flow positive. And people that are free cash flow positive, they've got no place to put their great capital. So we have a lot of great assets to invest in especially in the Permian basin and the Eagle Ford. And so it's not a key driver. So it's -- we got -- it's more about bringing forward our NAV and growing the value of the stock. So we can be free cash flow positive anytime, but we're not bringing our NAV forward. So we need -- as I mentioned before, Tim too, we need $300 billion to $400 billion of capital to develop these resources. So we're not focused on the free cash flow at this point in time.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. So does that mean that as you learn more about this play and delineate the play, we're probably going to see further acceleration beyond what you've already described?","Scott D. Sheffield","No, I think that the key driver is whether -- when we change our model to use 1,800 barrel a day IP rates. And that will -- it will set up a whole new growth profile for us over the next several years.","Operator","Rehan Rashid with FBR has a question.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes. And most -- all of my questions have been answered, but maybe I'll make up one. How about people? As you kind of develop a business plan into the out years, do you have enough kind of internal people, geologists, everything else in between?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Rehan, we've got -- we've built an outstanding team of geoscientists, as well as engineers, over the last several years. I feel very good about that. We're the biggest employer in Midland, which gives us a tremendous operational advantage out there. And people want to work for our company in all of our areas of operation because of our reputation and where we're going with the company. So I think people will be something that we can definitely achieve in terms of growth.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. And remind me the chart you had in the last presentation about total resource potential and recoverable in the Basin, Midland Basin of about $50 billion kind of for the industry and 30% of it for yours. Did that have only 2 of the prospective 6 formations?","Scott D. Sheffield","It did not have the lower Spraberry shale and the middle Spraberry shale. It did not have any downspacing below 140-acre spacing.","Operator","Next we'll take a question from John Wolff, ISI Group.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Conceptual question on the northern Midland Basin. Obviously, you're accelerating testing using 2 well pads, testing different zones at the same time. I understand that you need to understand your inventory quickly to know what your company is worth. But as we move out to development mode, which I would imagine is sort of more 2015. Do you see yourself sort of picking one zone that sort of carries 80%, 90% of the drilling? Is one question.","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, it's actually, right now, we got 2 zones that are pretty close, so Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B. The hardest problem, if we have 6 zones, they're all the same. So what do we pick? So we can only develop so much. But that will be a nice problem to have. But it's hard to predict that yet, John. But right now, we have 2 good zones. We're confident that the Jo Mill will come through. The Rising Star well, a third-party well in Midland County is a very positive well in the lower Spraberry shale. So that's highly encouraging. There's data points on that. So we're starting to get more data points and then at the end of the day, it's going to be hard to pick which of the 6 zones if they're all equal. Hopefully, there'll be some difference in well cost. In the Spraberry Shale, obviously, we hope that comes through because we can drill the wells cheaper long-term. So it's hard to guess at this point in time.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. As you look at your acreage to the east in Glasscock, Reagan County, is there any plans to do anything there and what do you think about the prospectivity?","Scott D. Sheffield","Yes, I saw the recent announcement by Energen, that was very positive in Glasscock County. And so we're very highly encouraged by Glasscock County. I think our acreage position is probably 100,000 acres, I'm guessing, give or take 10%. So we haven't moved over there yet. We will. We think it's a tremendous area, and you'll eventually see us move over there.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Is it fairly blocked up in terms of being able to drill laterals like you're drilling?","Scott D. Sheffield","Almost all of our acreage is and the reason the acreage in the center part of Midland County, just to let you know, the reason we're staying away from that, we're in the process of working agreements. Those are our units. That's the heart of the Spraberry and probably the heart of the Wolfcamp. And we own anywhere from 2\/3 working interest up to 90% working interest in these units and we're working out agreements with the majors. The majors are our partners. And that's the reason you haven't seen a lot of activity in those areas. Once we work out those agreements to start developing, you'll see aggressive drilling done in those areas. That will happen going into '14, '15, '16.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last one is on the vertical drilling. Can you kind of help us understand -- Energen made the same comment about continuing to drill verticals to hold deeper rights. Is that sort of -- is that the biggest driver of the 15 rigs running? Or is it just nice economics?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, the economics are good too, John. We've proven that through many multitudes of years. But an ancillary and significant benefit is its ability to control Wolfcamp and other horizontal acreage. And so it's precisely that. We're drilling wells that are economic on the one hand, but we're preserving our horizontal wherewithal in the future.","Jonathan D. Wolff - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Does that budget have potential to come down from, what is it, $600 million this year?","Timothy L. Dove","It does. I think the way you have to think about it is as we continually ramp up horizontal drilling over the next several years, you could see that a lot of those wells could be targeting areas that we, otherwise, would need to preserve with leasehold drills that would vertical in today's world. So I think you'll see that go down through time. We probably have a window where we need to lease a couple of more years of about 15 rigs, while we build the horizontal rig count. But probably, the window 3 to 5 years from now has us significantly reducing vertical drilling.","Operator","At this time, we have no questions in the queue. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Sheffield.","Scott D. Sheffield","Again, thanks. We appreciate everybody listening. Great questions. Looking forward to our November call with a lot more results on our program. Again, thanks. Everybody, have a great summer, the rest of summer.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call.

Joining us today will be Tim Dove, President and Chief Operating Officer; Rich Dealy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Hopkins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Pioneer has prepared PowerPoint slides to supplement their comments today. These slides can be accessed over the Internet at www.pxd.com. At the website, select Investors, then select Earnings and Webcast. This call is being recorded. A replay of the call will be archived on the Internet site through May 31.","The company's comments today will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements and the business prospects of Pioneer are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties are described in Pioneer's new release on Page 2 of the slide presentation and in Pioneer's public filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Pioneer's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Frank Hopkins. Please go ahead, sir.","Frank E. Hopkins","Thanks, Alexie. Good day, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you probably realize from the operator's introduction, Scott will not be on the call today. He's actually traveling internationally and unfortunately, the logistics of his travel precluded him from calling in.","With that, I'll briefly review the agenda for today's call. Tim's going to be up first. He's going to provide the financial and operating highlights for the first quarter and he'll update you on our latest plans for the remainder of the year. We'll then discuss the significant progress we are making to cut cost and become more efficient in response to the recent oil market downturn. This will be followed by an update of our 2015 drilling programs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford Shale. After Tim concludes his remarks, Rich will cover the first quarter financials in more detail and provide earnings guidance for the second quarter. And after that, we'll open up the call for your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy L. Dove","Thanks, Frank, and thank you, all, for being on the call. Pioneer did have a solid first quarter despite the fact that we were dealt a few blows in terms of winter weather at the outset of the year and the commencement of ethane rejection that we also were dealing with at the beginning of the year in what we hope was the bottoming of oil prices during the quarter. But production was near the midpoint of our range despite the decision to spread our POPs or put on production wells more evenly throughout the year, so that we were confident. We were optimizing the use of Pioneer Pumping Services on our own internal pumping services for well completions.","And importantly, as Frank has alluded to many times in our prior meetings, we've made a great deal of progress in terms of cost reductions and efficiency gains. And when you couple that with recent improvements in spot oil prices now or this morning, I see near $62 on a spot basis. We're getting more confident in our ability to add rigs beginning in the third quarter.","So some details on these points are on Slides 3 and 4 on the financial and operating highlights. We did announce an adjusted net loss of $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the quarter. Production, as I mentioned, was near the midpoint, 194,000 BOE per day. Again, we did lose some production due to the weather and ethane rejection. For instance, it just doesn't make sense to extract ethane to $0.18 a gallon.","The winter weather, it wasn't as bad as what it was in 2013. But we did have 3,200 wells down, including 90 horizontal wells. We didn't get them all back on production until the end of January.","We did make a decision, not long after the last earnings call, to move further towards utilization of Pioneer Pumping Services as our primary mover when it comes to completing wells. And that had the effect, and we'll talk more about it as we get into these slides, of spreading the horizontal completions more evenly throughout the year.","We do have one of the most extensive derivatives positions in the industry with about 90% of our oil volumes hedged for 2015, most of those are protected at a $71 per barrel swap value. And as you look to the financials, you'll realize that resulted in about $20 per barrel uplift in receipts in the first quarter for oil.","We have been active recently in adding some new three-way collars, about 10,000 barrels a day, this for 2016. It gives us protection below $60 with upside to $70 and above three-way collars with the downside protection, but upside as well.","We anticipate that with any kind of a drilling scenario we could foresee whether we're adding rigs or not. We're covered to the extent of about 70% to 80% in terms of our oil hedges and derivatives for 2016.","Derivative coverage for gas is about 90% for this year, again, with principally three-ways and those have given us a great deal of protection in today's gas market.","Balance sheet remains very strong with about $400 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and net-to-book about a 21%.","In terms of the Eagle Ford Midstream sale, the process is taking a lot longer than expected due to the complexities of the contractual arrangements that, really what it amounts to is moving from us providing our own services with our partner to contracting the same from a third-party and the complications around the idea of committing volumes and so on. But we remain very optimistic that we will announce the sale of this business during this month, and the proceeds from which will substantially improve the balance sheet even further.","Continuing on highlights, Slide 4. We already can point to about a 15% decrease in our drilling and completion capital so far this year compared to last year. And I think, we're well on our way to have over 20% reduction by the time we get to the end of the year, and I'll talk more about that at some slides that follow.","We also are doing a good job, I feel like, in utilizing new technologies and also just supplying current technologies to improve our efficiency gains when it comes to drilling and completions, and I also have slide on that, that follows.","On Monday, we did announce the closing of our Denver office that will occur by the middle part of this year, and we'll also be rightsizing our operations in the Raton basin to deal with the realities of today's natural gas prices. We're not drilling wells in the Raton. We have a lot of great people who work for us for many years in Colorado and this is a sort of a sad day for us to have to close this office, but it's the right thing to do from a cost perspective.","We have implemented, as we discussed in the last call, a high-graded horizontal drilling program that has the effect of drilling locations that, we are confident, have very strong returns even in this environment. The rig count, at least for today, remains the same and it's the same as we announced earlier on, which is a total of 16 horizontal rigs, 10 being in the Permian and 6 in the Eagle Ford.","We've been successful in exporting condensate out of the Eagle Ford, about 7,000 barrels a day net in the first quarter. Substantial improvements in pricing. I think if you look at where spot prices are for Eagle Ford, condensate in the U.S., they may average, say, $12 to $13 of WTI. We're easily halfway inside of that with the international exports. And so we anticipate increasing those volumes, and I'll talk more to that in a few slides.","We are also actively involved with moving volumes to the Gulf Coast where we think pricing will be -- and markets will be advantageous. We currently have 15,000 barrels a day going down the Longhorn Pipeline. And the total volumes we'll have exposed to Gulf Coast pricing will be about 50,000 barrels a day by the time we get into the third quarter, as we will participate in volumes on both Cactus and Permian Express as they get cranked up here in the next few months.","We are continuing and Scott has made a great deal of effort in terms of education, in terms of the benefits of lifting the export ban. I'm not going to go into that too much today. The current WTI and Brent differential is about $7. And any way to think about it, the benefits are obvious to the American consumer and the country for that matter from a geopolitical framework.","Let me now turn to an update for 2015. I mentioned this in the earlier commentary that we have spread what would have been first quarter and second quarter completions in the Permian Basin more evenly over the rest of 2015 to effectively use PPS. We know the PPS is competitive. We know that from indices and from other third-party market data that we obviously have access to. But the result of this is shifting about 25 of the 90 wells that we had planned for to be completed in the first half of this year or actually first quarter into the early second quarter to later in the year. This is the result of utilizing PPS essentially 100% and eliminating third-parties.","But this is a huge benefit to us because we know we're competitive on the one hand. Our utilization becomes very near 100%. Our costs are optimized between logistics and our personnel requirements. So this is the right thing for us to do from an economic standpoint.","The full year POP count is not impacted. We're going to still POP exactly the same number of wells. It's simply the fact that more will be popped in the third and fourth quarter than we had originally planned and that will still yield a forecast of full year growth of about 10% plus compared to 2\/3 -- 2014.","And as I mentioned at the outset, we still expect and I feel confident now about adding 2 horizontal rigs per month in the northern area of the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp beginning in the third quarter. I think the oil prices have been positive and that's -- we're certainly happy to see that. At the same time, we're in the midst, as I said, and hope to complete the Eagle Ford Shale midstream sale shortly.","The impact to add 2 rigs per month beginning July, of course, will have very little impact on 2015 production. We're generally going to be using 3-well pads, so this production would come on near the end of the year. But it does have a big impact on 2016. It would allow us to get back into growth mode in 2016, where otherwise might not be able if we did not add the rigs. The main message, though, is these wells are highly economic, and we believe the combination of our efficiency gains and cost savings put them where the margins are extremely strong.","So where we are today is that the balance sheet is very strong. We have a strong derivatives position, and what that gives us is the financial flexibility to ramp up drilling. And on this case, on what -- still it will be very high-return wells.","Turning to capital spending, this is Slide 6. Our capital spending program remains essentially the same as it has been at a total program value of $1.85 billion. Of course, that does not include any potential rig adds that I just mentioned. We'll be dealing with that when we determine exactly how we proceed with those rig adds. But the numbers you see on the left-hand tables are precisely the same as they have been.","As you know, our other capital projects that are listed below water and other projects such as processing facilities and so on, all of those projects have been substantially reduced, delayed or deferred in the current commodity price environment.","I'll talk more about that in the slide that follows. The program will be funded, of course, by our operating cash flow and cash on hand going forward.","On Slide 7, that level of spending will generate still a 10%-plus production growth rate for this year. I'd call your attention to the right set of bars, which is a quarterly estimate of production and particularly focused on the dashed boxes. Those are the original plan forecast that we had in the prior quarter. You saw production and that's an area, of course, peaking in the second quarter. This had us more with a plan of accelerating the completions using third parties. At that time, third parties were extremely much more expensive than they are today.","But what you can then see as you look at the blue bars is that by spreading the completions more evenly and, in that case, more efficiently utilizing Pioneer Pumping Services, we have a much stronger second half. In fact, the peak really occurs in the third quarter. We have a very strong fourth quarter as well. Of course, this does not include any volumes for the impact of adding 2 rigs if, in fact, that's decided, which we're leaning towards that very, very heavily today.","Then going on to Slide 8. We want to give you a little granularity on this POP schedule because it's sort of changed the trajectory of production by quarter for the year. But as you see the left-hand column, that's the first 4 months of the year. It shows an original plan of about 89 wells to POP with, in this case, the majority of being in the South, just based on timing. And then the decision was made, as I said, mid-February. So to spread these completions more efficiently across the year to utilize Pioneer Pumping Services heavily. And so we actually popped 66 wells only in the first -- or anticipate popping 66 wells in the first 4 months. We would've planned for much lower, 50 wells in the May to August time frame, now that's 65. So it is -- in essence, there's level loading of Pioneer Pumping Services.","Of course, when you get to the end of the year, you start to see the effect of the rig count. This, of course, does not include any additional rigs and the impact to production and POPs in the fourth quarter if were to add rigs. But suffice it to say at today's rig count, we will have -- we would have expected 27 wells to be POP and now it's with 35. So what you see is a general shifting of the POP schedule out into the year, again, focused on efficiencies and cost savings and the efficient use of Pioneer Pumping Services.","Of course, by the time you get out of the last 4 months of the year, Pioneer Pumping Services would have spare capacity to actually go compete the wells that would be drilled associated with additional rigs that we will be adding in the second half of the year. So they will be ready to complete those wells once we get them done by the end of the year.","Turning to Slide 9 now. And as I mentioned earlier, we made significant strides in terms of both cost reductions and efficiency gains. Of course, the objective is to improve margins and optimize returns and in essence, get back to an accelerated drilling program.","These next 2 slides cover those topics and the first, of which, is on our drilling and completions, reductions. I already mentioned, we've achieved 15%. We feel like so far. And the list is shown there as to what categories of savings we have been achieving.","In the materials area when it comes to drilling mud, chemicals and so on, some of these are down 18% to 20% already. Of course, fuel, diesel cost are down 36%, which is a huge benefit. Labor and transportation's a bit stickier, but still down. Rental equipment down, 17% to 20% and well services down as well.","The thing about Pioneer is that we came into 2015 with a substantial amount of rigs on the one-hand, contracted and on the other hand, tubulars, having been acquired in late 2015 in anticipation of a more accelerated drilling campaign in 2016. So we've got to burn off an inventory of tubulars from last year's significantly larger drilling campaign before we start seeing savings from tubulars. And similarly, we have stacked rigs today and we are going to have to deal with those coming-off contract over the next couple of years, but we'll make strides, of course, in reductions of day rates when that time comes.","We've estimated that if we were to essentially come out of the dirt with a new well without these continuing costs, here again I'm talking about tubulars and rig costs that are under contract, our D&C costs would today will be down in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% when you compare it with 2014 cost.","Facilities, of course, we continue to build tank batteries and saltwater disposal systems. Those costs were down about 10%, and we continue to pursue further cost reductions.","And we still have several RFQ's underway for various items. We are outbidding jobs out on a job-to-job basis, so we can get current cost even lower. For example, if we're going to use third-party rental equipment, third-party labor or transportation, we're outbidding those out on a job-by-job basis. The objective on all this, of course, is the continuing initiative for cost reductions, so we can hit our year-end targets.","Then turning to Slide 10. In terms of the efficiency gains and optimization planning that we've been doing, I think we've also made significant progress here with the detail shown on the slide. Some of this work is continuing in the sense that we have not stopped our R&D work when it comes to optimizing our completions or the testing of that optimization in terms of the stage lengths and clusters per stage, the fluids pump, the type of proppant and the concentration. All that work continues. It's going to be a continuing process for quite a long time as we test new zones and new areas, and that's one of the R&D areas we have not shutdown in response to the commodity price environment we're in.","We well publicize, I think, the fact that, especially in the South, we've been successful with a three-string casing design. This allows us to save quite a substantial sum per well, say, $500,000 to $1 million per well. But importantly, it has reduced drilling times down to the -- by neighborhood of 10 to 15 days per well. So we've got the wells down 15, 16 days and it wasn't unusual, not long ago, to have an average drilling time of 32 days. And so very substantial improvement out of this technology. Most of the testing we've done has been in the south. We're now moving to the north. The feeling is that all the southern acreage is applicable for this technology and about 60% of our northern acreage.","We're also expanding our use of dissolvable plug technologies, most of these have been done in the Eagle Ford. This allows us to pump plugs rather than having a tube that are dissolved versus having to come in with coil to drill out the plugs after the fracture done. And we're now moving those technologies into the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp. So a little early to say, but the early couple of wells that I've seen is done on. We've seen pretty substantial savings in the neighborhood of $300,000 per well and again, saving time.","And then finally, we are using fracture simulation diversion technologies where we can actually go in on a cheaper basis and identify exact zones to stimulate and by pumping diversion materials periodically, isolate those zones on a cost-effective basis.","In terms of LOE, at the bottom of the page, of course, LOE is more sticky due to its fixed cost nature. You have labor and electricity, which is generally pretty fixed. We're currently, so far this year, down about 5% compared to our 2014 values, and it's because of reductions where we've been able to achieve at least where we have third-party labor out in the field and also pumping unit repair values coming down as well as a work over where we use third parties.","So I guess, I'd summarize it by saying, we're well underway to achieving our year-end targets that's shown below, where we anticipate that we'll be able to get above 20% on D&C, cost reductions. Facilities, we feel like we can get to 15% and LOE to 10%. All of those contribute heavily to our ability to get back to work in terms of accelerated drilling.","I'm now going to turn more to an operational focus on Slide 11. And again, this is a just repeat of the slides that were done in the last quarter, but we now have included all the new wells where we drilled and completed in the first quarter. The red line, at the top, in the Wolfcamp A and the blue line in the Wolfcamp B, show all the wells drilled and their average laterals.","We're pleased to say that the new well performance in the Wolfcamp A and B continues to be repeatable and consistent. And as you see from the graphs, in general, approaching or exceeding 1 million BOE in terms of their potential. You can see on the map where those wells are going to be drilled and the number of wells per area.","Slide 12 is focusing on the high grading of activity in the North. Now we did successfully reduce our rig count down to 6 very quickly this year by the end of February and we are, again, focusing on areas that we feel like having the best economics in the phase of today's commodity prices. So those areas that we have offset wells that have high EURs or we may have net revenue interest that are high due to low royalties and where we would have existing tank batteries nearby, so that we can reduce ancillary capital costs. And all that is just based on improving the well economics for where we are going to be drilling.","We will put about 85 to 90 horizontal wells on production this year. That's a slight reduction from last year. Some of those wells, of course, are carried over from 2014.","If you look at the map, the actual number of wells we will spud this year in the North will be 60, mostly using 2 and 3 well pads, but then 90% of which would be Wolfcamp B where we have the most confidence and the most data in terms of the number of wells that have been drilled and, therefore, the most confidence in the economics as well. But overall, our split of wells to be put on production will be about 70% Wolfcamp wells because of the carryover of other zones from prior completions at the end of last year.","The D&C costs are roughly about $9 million, assuming a 9,000-foot lateral length and only a 10% cost reduction. These costs, I think, should come down as we achieved the next 10% or more cost reductions as we go through the year. And importantly, our returns still look very high, these 1 million barrel wells do produce very high rates of return up to 55% using current strip prices. Of course, we were using an average oil price of $55 and today, it's exceeding that. So in actuality, the economics probably are stronger than what I just mentioned.","Now we only put 15 wells on production in the North, that's only because we put a large number of wells on production in the North in the fourth quarter and the inventory of available wells was significantly less in the first quarter just the timing of when the wells were completed, dictated that. At the same time, we didn't complete very many wells in the South in the fourth quarter and caught up in the first quarter. You'll see that switch as we go into the second quarter and beyond. We'll be completing more wells in the North. Obviously, we have more rigs running there and at the same time, you'll see more completions as well. We did complete the drilling of all of our vertical program by the end of February. You'll see, if you look at the data, there's only 59 vertical rigs running in the Permian Basin where there had been 340. So the days of vertical drilling are smoothing, let me say.","13, Slide 13, now we're turning to the South. Suffice it to say, we're executing a similar program when it comes to high grading the activity. We have 4 rigs running down there. And essentially, the same notion, drilling the best areas where we have the best economics closest to facilities. We're going to put about 75 to 80 wells on production this year, that's a reduction from last year, mostly owing to the lower rig count. And as you can see in the map, we're only be spudding 45 wells. There's large amount of carryovers, I mentioned earlier, into the first quarter from last year's activity.","Again, 90% Wolfcamp in terms of drilling -- Wolfcamp B drilling, but about 75% of the wells put on production will be Wolfcamp B, owing to the wells being carried over. About $8 million, D&C cost per well in the South, that's principally because it's shallower on the one hand. But the returns, as a result, end up being very similar to the North, still about 55% based on $55 oil. We did place, as I mentioned, 31 wells on production in the South owing to that timing of when wells were available to be completed.","Turning to Slide 14 then. All this, yields a substantial amount of opportunity for growth, in fact, our growth trajectory here for this year is about 20% plus. Of course, similar to the first slide I showed on the company's production, you can see in the graph here that the dotted lines would have had us completing many more wells in the second quarter. We've pushed that out in an essence, evenly spread those wells into the third and fourth quarters. So you see, third quarter being peak production, with a decline into the fourth quarter assuming we did not add any more rigs. Of course, as I mentioned, we're highly prepared to add more rigs starting in the third quarter, which would have some impact on fourth quarter production. Again, we did put 46 wells on production in the first quarter and pushed some of those out into subsequent quarters.","Production, about 112,000 BOE a day, 67% oil. It had -- this is where most the effects we saw when weather and ethane rejection took hold. We do expect production to be up pretty substantially in 2015.","So what we're really saying is production in 2015 will have very small effect from any drilling, but much more significant effect from any additions to the drilling campaign starting in July next year results.","Turning now to Permian infrastructure. As I mentioned earlier, we have deferred capital in our 4 main areas where we spend money on infrastructure in the face of the commodity prices compared to an earlier plan. That said, we're still spending about $410 million, a lot of it is buried in drilling capital and tank batteries and so on. But also, we still are proceeding with some expenditures when it comes to gas processing. A lot of that is related to compression and well tie-ins, but also even of the Buffalo plant where our partner, Targa, is contemplating a plant to be added in 2016 some foundation and compression work is ongoing. So we'll spend a total of about $70 million there.","We have pushed out our Brady sand mine expansion still. It could be put on in 2017 or '18. It just depends on when we believe we're hoping to have the sand demand that corresponds to the rig count.","And then finally, in the water infrastructure realm, we announced recently and it was in the press pretty significantly, we've agreed with the city of Odessa to delay order offtake for up to 2 years that will help us match our water needs more closely with the projects with Odessa to deal with our needs from the standpoint of the drilling campaigns.","We still are spending some money. In fact, we have a substantial project going on in the South. We are tying in some third-party water that we have been trucking up into our southern operations. So we do have still a capital budget here about $100 million for this year. The majority of which is in the South to tie in some existing water.","I think if the numbers show that if we were to add 2 horizontal rigs per month starting in July in the North, we would need additional infrastructure, probably $35 million to $50 million for some of the same things, but particularly tank batteries, salt water disposal, well connections and so on.","If you look at the drilling capital add in 2016, it would come from those rigs, it probably is in the neighborhood of $225 million to $250 million. So overall, to the extent we were to move ahead with the 2 wells beginning -- 2 rigs, sorry, beginning in July per month, we'd be adding probably $300 million plus or minus to the capital budget.","On Slide 16, the same optimization story holds for our South Texas operations. In the Eagle Ford, we have 6 rigs running. We're high grading and, in fact, we're only drilling in 2 counties. Karnes and DeWitt. We'll put about 95 to 100 wells on production this year and that compares with the amount we'll spud of 85. Again, a carryover somewhat. Importantly, the upper and lower drilling campaigns have continued to be consistently similar. That is to say, our upper wells are preforming very well and consistent with the lower targets.","Our well cost are coming down here. I think, eventually, we can get our well cost down to about $6 million or $6 million-plus in the Eagle Ford. And it's the reason that we can really generate a very high rates of return from the Eagle Ford's very prolific wells, very low-cost wells after we're now into this project some 6 years, and so this is an area we still see. The Pioneer if you look on the bottom right, it's drilling some of the best wells in the industry as measured by cumulative production for 5 months. We did put 16 wells on production in the first quarter, mostly -- basically split between upper and lower targets and again, that's proven to be a positive.","Turning to Slide 17. For 2015, 6 rigs this year can give us about a 9% production growth. So you see, if you look at the bars, relatively flattish scenario based on the lower rig count. If we did put those 16 wells on production, production is 47,000 BOE a day. Importantly, 40% being condensate so there's an opportunity for value accretion to the extent we can export more condensate.","We did find that we had about 2,000 barrels a day of reductions due to the fact the offset completions were higher -- offset shut-ins basically were from new completions were higher than expected. What we found is, in drilling only 2 counties, our operations are very centralized around each other and resulted as -- we have many, many wells in proximity to new drills and new completions, and so I think we underestimated the number of wells that we needed to shut in for offset completions when we were working in such a tight arena of drilling, which we had not been doing, of course. We've been drilling in many areas if you go back up to the 10 or 12 rig count in the past. We do have the effects of ethane rejection also having been built in here as well, and I think that ethane rejection will continue through the year.","So in summary, I would say, it's been a very good quarter. And one more slide I do want to cover before I get there, and that is on the export business. I think, if you look at the economics of this, they're simply outstanding. We export about 7,000 barrels a day and additional 6,000 barrels a day exporting in June. We really want to get to 75% or more of our condensate exported. Most of this volume is going to export markets, such as in Asia and Europe and generally as a replacement for NAFTA.","So I want to stop there and pass it over to Rich in a minute. But on summary, I'd say, in the first quarter, we were very, very busy. And I think that's important, and that is continuing into the second quarter because what we're focused on is improvement in several key areas, including cost reductions, efficiency gains and productivity enhancement. And all of those, based on how well we're were doing in those, bode well for return to accelerated drilling. And hopefully, in the very near future, you'll be hearing from us probably shortly in the next few weeks on that topic.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to cover the first quarter financial and second quarter outlook.","Richard P. Dealy","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. I'm going to start on Slide 19, where we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $78 million or $0.52 per diluted share. That did include noncash mark-to-market derivative gains of $22 million after-tax or $0.15. And then on the slide, you can see we did also have unusual items aggregating about $95 million of loss or $0.64. The most significant of which is noncash impairment that we had on the West Panhandle field due -- all due to lower commodity prices we would -- oil, NGL and gas prices, all lower relative to where they were at the end of the year. So adjusting for those items, we're $5 million loss or $0.03 per diluted share.","Looking at the bottom of Slide 19 where we show our results relative to the guidance we provided, you'll see that all those are very consistent with guidance. I'm not going to go through the detail, but they're there for your review.","Turning to Slide 20, price realizations. Something I know all of you are very well aware of what's happened to commodity prices during the first quarter. You can see here that our oil price realizations were down 35% to $43.02 relative to the fourth quarter. Also, NGL prices were down 19% to $15 and gas prices were down 25% to $2.70 for the quarter. So when you look at this, this is the primary reason why our oil and gas revenues declined 36% during the quarter or about $287 million.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, the derivative activity that we have, as Tim mentioned, did provide support. Derivative activity added $206 million of cash for the quarter. You can see, we had a pickup of $20 on -- per barrel on the oil derivatives and $0.82 on the gas derivatives.","Turning to Slide 21, production costs. We're down for the quarter 8% to $12.56 per BOE from $13.61 in the fourth quarter. Just going down the bar chart, the biggest declines are in production taxes in the yellow part of the bar there due to lower commodity prices. And then looking at LOE, it was down about $0.70 or so there due to our cost-reduction initiatives, as Tim talked about, as we -- he mentioned it's still work in progress. We still would like to see 10% by the end of the year. So something that we're still working on today.","Moving to Slide 22 on our liquidity position. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion with $400 million-ish on cash on the balance sheet. As you can see here, very strong balance sheet, still. We did see a reduction in our cash of about $642 million, which is principally due to paying invoices that were associated with our higher activity levels that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014. You can see here on the slide, we've enumerated about $720 million of expenditures on drilling infrastructure that was a lot of Q4 costs that weren't invoiced until Q1. We also had a $250 million reduction in accounts payable due to reduced drilling activity. This was partially offset by operating cash flow of about $330 million for the quarter, excluding working capital changes.","So all in all, still a very strong balance sheet. And as we talked about earlier, we're further strengthened when we're able to complete the EFS Midstream divestiture.","Turning to Slide 23, second quarter guidance. Production for the second quarter is estimated to be 198,000 to 203,000 BOEs per day. It does reflect the spreading of our completions over the remainder of the year as we more efficiently utilize our Pioneer Pumping Services. Production cost of $13 to $15. This is higher than the first quarter actual results, mainly reflecting the higher commodity prices we're seeing in the second quarter. So we do expect production taxes to be up some. And also, the increase in LOE if and when the midstream deal closes, that will be about $0.75 per BOE add to our operating cost, mainly as we no longer will have our share of profits that reduce it today.","The only other item here of significance to talk about is other expense of $50 million to $60 million of guidance out there that does include about $30 million to $35 million of stacked rig fees that we'll have in the second quarter, and so that's up from where we've been in the past.","So with that, I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question at this time from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tim, I wonder if I could just go by to your commentary around spending on the incremental rigs. To add 2 rigs per month, I guess, that would be the run rate. What is the incremental capital associated with those on an annualized basis? And then I've got a couple of follow-ups, if I may. I just want to get a clarity on that first.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes. As I mentioned, Doug, we anticipate that if you add 2 rigs a month starting July for 2015, it's going to be roughly $250 million, it depends on the exact timing of the rigs and when they all get started and so on. But if you just do the sort of simplistic math, that's where we would be -- where it would come out, plus some ancillary activities surrounding infrastructure. But if you annualize that, that's about $1 billion, I would say, roughly. That's a round number again.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And that assumes what well cost -- how are you thinking about allocating well cost? Or is that including midstream capital as well, Tim? Or is that just the pure cost of adding the rig?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, last year, of course, we were dealing with $100 million per rig per year as basically the run rate. I think today's world, we're utilizing numbers when we start giving numbers like this, the $80 million to $90 million per rig per year. So it's incorporating essentially some of the cost savings we've already seen.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's pretty consistent, I guess. I've got 2 quick follow-ups, if I may. The first one is really on Midstream spending because obviously when we talk about D&C costs and a lot of managements have different ways of approaching this, but when you talk about the IRRs and the well, generally midstream is not included and we are seeing you, I guess, moving towards monetizing your Eagle Ford midstream. So when you think about the -- I guess, the short quickest [indiscernible] oil, the scale of midstream spending that you'd acquire going forward, has your thinking changed any in terms of how you managed that process whether it'd be monetizing the midstream, whether it'd be using a third party to build out for you? I'm just kind of curious as to how you think about the overall kind of midstream MLP value as an option. And then I've got one quick follow-up, please.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, of course. You can see from what we've just done. We're in the process of doing. We're not opposed to monetizing midstream if we feel like it's the right to do. But in Permian, we have a little bit of a different situation. Actually, we're very, very happy regarding our partner there, Targa, for the principal amount of our assets and the nice thing they bring to the table there is excess capacity. And what that allows us to do is manage around an upturn and acceleration in drilling campaign with additional space. In addition to which, as I mentioned, when we were talking about this during the call, the Buffalo plant today, they have planned sometime in 2016 will help as well.","But what's happened, of course, is with the downturn and the rig count reductions -- in Permian, you've seen a 49% reduction in horizontal rigs -- we just don't have any capacity constraints when it comes to this infrastructure build out today, but we have to prepare for the future and for the success that would come from accelerated drilling. And toward that end, the one thing that this position gives us -- that is a 27% interest in this big complex -- is the fact that we have a seat at the table to make sure our wells get connected on time. And that's a huge positive when you're in the mode we are, which is trying to execute properly on all of this campaign, as well as initiatives that we have underway with the likes of Targa to improve the compression in the field. It's a lower field compression, lower basically pressure such that we can get incremental volumes out of both high-volume and low-volume wells when it comes to natural gas. So I think there's a very significant need for a symbiotic relationship in the Permian Basin when it comes to gas processing. You never say never on these things, but that's where we're currently leaning.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't know if you would be prepared to answer my final question, but I'm going to have a go anyway. There's been a fairly high profile, I guess, investor criticizing not only Pioneer, but the industry as a whole in terms of shale economics and mechanics and so on. I'm just wondering if you have considered any kind of a response to that or what you would say to your investors who are obviously seeing that in headlines out there, and I'll leave it there.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Doug, as you might expect, we've been working pretty hard right now to finalize this earnings release and preparing for the conference call over the last 2 days, so I can't say we've had a huge opportunity to fully analyze the presentation in question from Mr. Einhorn. But what I would say is, that all said, when we look at the analysis from a cursory standpoint, and we have done some cursory review of the material. It has identified several areas where our view and Mr. Einhorn's view regarding the assumptions and analysis and conclusions regarding our business would differ materially. And I'm not going to really get into those details of where those differences are. I think some of them are rather obvious if you take a look at the material. But what we can say is that -- and we can affirmatively assert that our assets are among the very best in the domestic oil and gas arena. Our D&C and development economics of these wells we're drilling are very strong, as I mentioned during the call. And that's true even in light of current commodity prices which we hope, of course, are improving. But price is only one component. A lot of that analysis is focused on price. It's really the margin of the well, as you know, that matters. And I've already outlined a lot of initiatives we have underway to cut costs and improve efficiencies. And I think all third parties would agree, the breakeven on our wells in the Permian are among the best in the industry, and we can weather the current price storm. So I think we'll continually get better at what we do best, which is, as you know, a common trait in shale development, as we learn more and more from the wells. So when we look at the 20,000-plus inventory of horizontal wells in our inventory, and then we look at that representing 11 billion BOE of resources, I think those are all going to be economically drilled in the fullness of time. Now it's going to take a few decades. And that said, our company and others who are doing in the similar business are going to further contribute to the country's energy revolution, and we think we firmly believe that going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you guys could address the kind of EUR increase in the 2015 program. I think last quarter you guys were saying 900,000 BOE EURs in the Northern Midland. This quarter you bumped it up to, I guess, 1 million BOE. Can you maybe just kind of talk about what's driving that, if it's better performance today, better fracs or whatever you're seeing?","Frank E. Hopkins","Leo, it's Frank. I think it's fair to say, if you look at the ongoing results, and we have a slide in the presentation which shows the history of all of our Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B wells. You can see they're tracking that 1 million barrel type curve. So you're right. It's about performance. And moving forward, we expect to continue to drill wells that look like that.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess with respect to well cost, I know you guys have laid out the $9 million well cost in Northern Midland, $8 million in the South. Just curious, at this point, are you guys ahead of that a little bit today, some of the cost savings you quoted maybe implies that maybe you are?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, Leo, the $8 million and $9 million as was mentioned or actually is included in the slide shows that we are incorporating about a 10% reduction in cost in those numbers. And so what -- it's sort of a difference of concept here because these wells that are currently getting drilled, we won't see the actual results regarding how they compared to their AFEs until a month or 2 from now. But that said, we're just now reaching that sort of 13%, 15% number when it comes to cost reductions. So we're not going to really see those in AFEs probably for a couple more months. There is definitely a lag built-in to what we say, we believe we can currently achieve and what actually hits the books from the standpoint of -- after the wells are drilled.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, yes, I'm sure you guys have done some scenario analysis. But I guess if you do follow through and add the 2 rigs per month starting in July here, just curious as to what type of level of production growth that gets you to for 2016?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think if you take a look at the modeling we've done and you assume, as you mentioned, and what we've been talking about 2 rigs per month beginning July, the answer to some extent is dependent upon how many -- depends on how many rigs you're also going to add in 2016, if any. But I think if we add the rigs we were talking about this year and we add a few rigs in 2016, it's not out of the realm of possibility we would be double-digit growth rate again.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Tim, I'm wondering if I could try to peel back a bit on the shift in completions later in the year and what that may mean about what the underlying well production is because I look at 2 things. One, you guys started deferring those completions in mid-February. And so you've shifted them. The same number of wells are going to come on, but those wells are going to contribute for fewer days in '15. And so it seems to me that for your Q1 volumes to come in, frankly, above expectations on oil even with those deferred completions and for you to keep 2015 guidance intact that something has to be outperforming your plan underneath there. Is that the right conclusion to draw?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think that's certainly the one that I would focus on simply because we are focused on, as I mentioned here, pretty heavily where we're going to be drilling excellent wells. And it's hard to account for a situation where we basically produce near our midpoint, but we didn't POP as many wells as we planned, unless you refer to the fact that we're drilling very good wells. And I think that would be the same answer I would give pertaining to a shift out in the year or a level loading of POPs shifting them out of the year. You lose days of production, but it's offset by strong well performance. And I think that's really the only conclusion you can come up to.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, good. And then shifting gears over to the -- I think this touches maybe on Doug's question earlier is, first off, I want to thank your engineers for coming up with a $9 million well cost and 1 million barrel EUR because I can do the math on that. That's a $9 F&D.","Timothy L. Dove","We try to keep all the numbers rounded for you, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I appreciate that. So that's $9, but I recognize that doesn't incorporate a lot of the midstream, maybe some of the surface infrastructure, things like that. Tim, if you were -- could you give us some guidance, what percentage on top of that $9 should we think about for a really fully loaded F&D?","Timothy L. Dove","Okay. So this is going to take a minute to explain just because it's semi-complicated because if you were to load up all the tank battery cost and saltwater disposal wells on the first well, you'd get an astronomical number. We do have to frontload a lot of this capital. But when we are building tank batteries out, Charles, we're generally doing it for 60 wells, okay? And so the wells when they come on, let's say, the first 2 -- 2, 3-well pads, if they were to be labored with all that cost, it could be significant because of the initial spending. That's going to be $6 million to $8 million to begin with. When you look at the fullness of time though, when you amortize the cost of, let's say, a tank battery and related saltwater disposal over the whole 60-well program, it's going to average $40,000 per well -- sorry, $400,000 per well, slipped a digit, about $400,000 per well. So again, if you're using the 1 million, it's $0.40 to $0.50 per BOE.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. So just like a little $0.05 uplift?","Timothy L. Dove","The concept you have to think about because we're spending the money upfront. So when people comment, \"Gosh, all this capital is going out the door.\" Sure it is, but you're not going to have to spend it again on the last 59 wells.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. That's a great explanation, Tim.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Pavan Hoskote - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Pavan Hoskote. I'm on for Brian Singer. You've highlighted significant cost savings from efficiencies and cost deflation, but your capital budget is unchanged. Can you talk about what flexibility or buffer this cost savings has created for you to then increase activity levels without a fully proportionate increase in your capital budget?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think that's a great question. I think, of course, we are focusing in on when we -- from a budgetary standpoint, a 10% cost reduction on average for the year already. So that was in the $9 million number that Charles referred to, and then $8 million in the south and so on. That said, to the extent we can achieve the 20%-plus, then in the second half of the year, we should see reduced cost. And as a result, the dollars we're spending are going further in terms of the wells. And what that will give us is some flexibility in terms of how much actual net capital adds we have to add in order to add the 2 rigs per month beginning July. It may not be the whole, let's just say, $250 million because we'll get some benefit from the original campaign of 10 rigs on reduced cost. So I think you're on to something there.","Pavan Hoskote - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my follow-up is on the Eagle Ford. You've talked about divesting your Eagle Ford midstream assets. Can you talk about what type of minimum activity you may need to maintain in the Eagle Ford to support your midstream contracts?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think if you take a look at it and just do the math from the standpoint we're looking at, it's not a dissimilar amount of drilling that we're going today. So as I've mentioned, we have 6 rigs running. I think that 6 rigs in general would be such that it would meet the requirements of throughput that are being contemplated in the negotiations, and I really can't go much more further than that in terms of detail.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tim, I wanted to first ask about your development scheme in the Midland Basin. Last quarter, you guys talked about focusing in on the Wolfcamp B interval. Some in industry, Tim, have question whether this could potentially lead to suboptimal recoveries because if you come back later and, for example, did the Wolfcamp A, that the frac energy could propagate toward some of the depleted zones. I was wondering if you could maybe address your development scheme compared to others out there.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, well, first of all, I think the answer is, there's no cookie-cutter answer to that question because every area has its own unique attributes when it comes to how it would be optimally completed. But I will say, I agree with what you said here and basically where you were leading to which is, we do believe that there is a potential that you could have energy moving into the A from B completions. And so one of the things we have been doing from the standpoint of schematically planning development in certain areas of the basin is to drill and complete the Wolfcamp Bs and come back and do the As. We think there's nothing destructive about that at all. In fact, that's probably optimal. But realizing there's all kinds of zones we're dealing with here. We've got the Lower Spraberry Shale. We've got the Middle Spraberry Shale. You've got the Wolfcamp D. Each of these zones are on the one hand going to have -- we'll have learnings regarding how to properly and efficiently develop them in terms of the scheme of development that you mentioned. But it's also the separation between the wells, the spacing, the staggering of the wells. This is very much a science project today. So I think if you look at some of the areas some people would say, \"Gosh, as you go west, the Lower Spraberry Shale is better than the Wolfcamp B. We look at that and simply say, we think the Lower Spraberry Shale is excellent, even as well across our acreage with some 600,000 acres. The Wolfcamp B we've proven is excellent. So I think the answer is, all of these areas will take a lot of science, and it's going to take some time. It's not like Eagle Ford where we have 6 years into it now and where there's one zone or 2 zones that we can pretty much understand. Even in the Eagle Ford, we have 6 or 7 areas where we complete the wells differently. So this is going to be a science project, Arun, I guess, through quite a long time.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. It just sounds like, Tim, you're still testing a lot of development ideas and haven't yet come to the conclusion in terms of the optimal way quite yet. Is that fair?","Timothy L. Dove","I think the optimal way, you learn in about 15 years, okay? I mean, if we just take -- we're taking stabs at it as we go forward. And our laboratory is slow, okay? I was accused of that in one of the conference really, \"You guys are slow.\" And I said, \"Well, yes, it takes 150 days to get the wells on production, and then you got to watch them for a while before you can decide whether they're better than the other ones you just drilled next door.\" So it's going to take time. It's going to take a lot of effort. I feel very confident in our scientists here and our engineers that they will get to the bottom of all this in the fullness of time.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. My follow-up just really is regarding a, the Spraberry potential, what are you doing on the Spraberry? And yes, we've seen some pretty eye-popping industry results on the western side of the Midland Basin. I was just wondering what you're doing there and perhaps the potential that you see on your acreage position.","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we love the Lower Spraberry Shale. It calculates as having the most oil in place of any of the zones. Accordingly, we think it has tremendous potential. We have shown some quite excellent results from Lower Spraberry drilling ourselves. It's just in this year, we're not doing a lot of Lower Spraberry drilling just because most of that Spraberry acreage we don't have to get to for the time being to hold acreage, and we've worked out a lot of deals with landowners to that extent. We're focused more on the Wolfcamp B simply because we have more data. And so data gives us confidence in terms of the situation. We want to make sure these wells are highly economic. In other words, we can predict their productivity. But that said, as we move forward, and let's just say we were to add the 2 rigs per month starting July, it's not inconceivable at all that, that would incorporate more Wolfcamp A drilling, more Lower Spraberry Shale drilling and in some other areas than we currently are focused. So stay tuned. I think the Lower Spraberry Shale is a phenomenal asset.","Arun Jayaram - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. If I could squeeze one more in. Tim, in the middle of Martin County, the Sale Ranch, you guys have drilled, based on completion reports, some really eye-popping kind of IPs. Could you comment on that acreage position in Martin County? And perhaps would that be an area that you'd put more activity at, throw some more activity at?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, we have a limited sample size would be the first thing I'd say, but we have 2 sort of phenomenal wells here in the Wolfcamp B that have been drilled up in the Sale Ranch area and eye-popping results is maybe diminishing it to some extent. A couple of these wells if you look at the average 24-hour rates in terms of IP were at 2,800 barrels a day on average. And then if you look at the cume on the wells, each of these wells has made 130,000 barrels in 150 days. So they are monster wells. They're twice as productive so far, at least, as the Hutt wells when you measure it on the same exact basis. So these are eye-popping. They need to be watched. And I can promise you, they have our attention.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Freeman with Raymond James.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just looking at -- as we think about the rig adds and you're talking about some of these completion efficiency change you've made on -- like the 3-string casing design in the Wolfcamp, where you're shaving 10, 15 days, the Eagle Ford with the dissolvable plug, maybe 3 days off there. The last update, I think you have given on spud-to-POP, like Northern Wolfcamp, you're around 145 days for like a 3-well pad. Eagle Ford was around 100 days. Could you may be update that or even say kind of what you would think those would be maybe more toward the end of the year?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think -- thanks for the question, John. I think the answer to that has somewhat though to do with this level loading or spreading on completions. The effect of that is to, by choice, increase spud-to-POPs in certain areas, right? So actually, I had the math done on this. And our average spud-to-POP in the north -- this is Permian North today is about 160. I think we were like 150 last year is because we've chosen to push out the completion timing. If you look at the SWAT area, the south, it's about 140 today. It's always been a bit lower anyway because of the shallower well drilling. And so we have chosen to kick these out. I think if we get more into more of a level-loaded mode of completing these wells than we're anticipating this year -- it's not unusual, as you mentioned, to get these wells done instead of 150 days on average last year to 130, for instance, by a combination of the different technologies you mentioned. So I promise you, we've got pretty aggressive targets, but this is a year where we're actually choosing to push it out slightly.","John Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Tim, just one follow-up, when you mentioned -- kind of threw out kind of a double-digit growth number next year assuming you do go ahead with the rig ramp, like what would you kind of assume you were kind of baking in on kind of the spud-to-POP?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think we'll be much more level-loaded at that point realizing our Pioneer Pumping Services fleet is going to be looking for business in the fourth quarter if we were not to add those rigs. I think we'll be in good shape with the fleet if we do add the rigs starting in July for the completions that are needed in the fourth quarter. It's somewhat dependent upon how many rigs we want to add in 2016. But I think we would want to have to go into 2016 with a pretty flat schedule of POPs and if you do that, I think we can then start to chip away at those efficiencies. In other words, you can get in that scenario hopefully down to 130 in the north as opposed to this situation here, we're choosing to push it to 160.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly kind of trying to triangulate a little bit more towards '16 guidance. Can you guys articulate what you think production adds per an individual rig are on an annual basis? Obviously, we got to worry about declines and all that, but just what an individual rig would produce in a year once it's up and running?","Timothy L. Dove","Frank, I defer to you.","Frank E. Hopkins","David, let me get back to you on that.","Timothy L. Dove","We have to do a little math on that question.","Frank E. Hopkins","I have not looked at it that way, but we can do it for you, I guess, looking forward on an annualized basis.","Timothy L. Dove","And I think you have to assume...","Frank E. Hopkins","The calendar year.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, you got to assume -- I guess he's saying, you put the rig out there 1\/1\/16, what's it do for you?","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Frank E. Hopkins","We have those recoveries.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we'd have to get back at you, David.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just looking at the cash flow estimates that you outlined, now $1.6 billion, which is down from $1.7 billion. Obviously, that's related to the POPs or the production cadence. Completely understand the change to CapEx with the pending Eagle Ford divestiture, pipeline divestiture and rig ramp. But if that doesn't happen, can you articulate the CapEx savings kind of shifting POPs and stacking rigs versus fully utilizing the Pioneer Pumping Services. I'm just to get to -- I don't know -- backing into that decision on a standalone basis in the event that this transaction doesn't come through, which seems highly likely at this point that it comes through.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, well, first of all, likelihood of the EFS Midstream notwithstanding, if it were not to occur, then we'd be in a situation in which we probably would think twice about heavily ramping up. I think the probability of the transaction is still very high. It's really not that big of an issue. But if that were to be the case, then I think what we would be doing is still pushing out the POPs simply because we think that's a cost saver and an efficiency adder and would really have nothing to do with whether those -- that was -- that sale was achieved or not. The question is going to be at that point, how much do we want to ramp? What does that do to '16? What does that do to '16 planning for additional rigs? And so right now, I think we're hoping for scenario one, I guess, is the way I'd put it.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes. Just thinking about scenario 2 though, if I back into it and I think about what you articulated for facility cost savings, well cost savings whatnot, it looks like that would back into north of $200 million versus having, call it, $100 million of cash flows slip out. Am I way off base on my math?","Timothy L. Dove","Is your $200 million an annualized number?","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Yes.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, some of the cost savings we're talking about aren't kicking in as I mentioned due to this sort of the lag effect until probably July 1 in some cases, and so I would half that number just to be safe.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. So if nothing else, it's a net neutral transaction at this juncture and then benefits by the contango in the oil curve, is that kind of a fair way to think about it?","Timothy L. Dove","That's reasonable, yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Christensen with Imperial Capital.","Robert L. Christensen - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I'm lost a little bit on those 2 rigs a month starting in July. You made it contingent on 20% cost reductions. You achieved that. You made it contingent on better oil prices. That appears to have come through. You've then added it's contingent on the midstream, I mean, but you say, the midstream is still likely in May, I just -- I don't know what it takes to have an announcement on adding 2 rigs. I'm...","Timothy L. Dove","Well, let me just tell you, first of all, I'd say read between the lines in that sense. But then secondly, our board meeting, of course, surrounds our annual meeting, which is on May 20. That will be a subject for the board to consider as well, and I would expect we'll have something to say about it subsequent to those meetings.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Say, Tim, just a quick one, one quick question on the ramp -- the rig ramp that you mentioned. Are most of those are -- for you or Frank I guess -- where you're going to target will be mostly Lower Spraberry wells on those additional rigs or is that just going to be kind of spread out?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, well, first of all, Neal, the concept of drilling this year, of course, as I mentioned, is mostly Wolfcamp B in certain locations. We'll spread out -- in that scenario, we start adding rigs and start targeting some of our better Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry Shale zones. So you'll see us basically expand the footprint and the zones.","Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Makes sense. And then just lastly on M&A. Obviously, you guys have a ton of acreage, not necessary for you all. Just your thoughts -- for you or Frank -- what you're seeing in the play right now as far as sort of bid? I know for a while it seemed like the bid-ask spread was pretty wide. What are you seeing out there on acreage prices, anything going on?","Timothy L. Dove","I haven't really seen very many acreage deals. I think it's precisely for the reason you said that the bid-ask spread is really unclear. Having come off $42 oil and now at $62, what's the right number for a parcel out there? I don't -- I haven't seen much deal data to speak of whatsoever. And so I think that could be the case for a while. I think everybody is grappling with, where does this thing go? Are we really done with the bottom at $42? We tend to think so. And so we think the signs point to positive. But as you know, in those kind of markets, it takes a buyer and a seller that are coming together. I think that's the big issue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","So the question I have is that truly to get drilling days of 15 to 16 in the southern part of the basin is remarkable. So my question for you is, using the 3-string casing design, what's keeping you from actually applying that to the entire basin? And sort of related to that, right now, we're seeing a lot of cost savings and how much roughly percentage-wise would we -- would those be sort of lasting savings that we could see sustaining after the downturn is over? That's all.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, thanks, Irene. I think on the 3-string casing design, of course, one of the things that benefits us there is, we have a pretty caustic and difficult zone that we're dealing with called the San Andres in the shallower part of the well, say, it was at 5,000 feet something like that. And what this casing design allows us to do is to drill and in essence cement the zone in and then drill the remaining part of the well in one basically...","Frank E. Hopkins","One string.","Timothy L. Dove","That's right, sorry guys. And therefore, save a lot of money related to days having to trip out and add another string. And so I think if you take a look at -- I even mentioned this during the call, if you remember, that in the south, we believe, it is almost 100% applicable, even though we're just starting it up. If you look at the north, what you have is a very substantial amount of vertical Spraberry wells having been drilled. And so the issue in certain areas is the potential for some significant lost circulation zones in the Spraberry, which would give you pause and perhaps may give you the decision to go to a 4-string design just to prevent that because you're really dealing with a potential for stuck pipe. You're dealing with basically a potential for train wreck in terms of well cost, and that's the last thing we want to do. So we might in those areas, the other 40% of the north, defer and just kind of say, let's just go with the 4-string casing design to prevent train wrecks. But we'll be pushing the envelope on that. I think it's -- we'll have an incentive more and more to utilize that in the entire basin.","Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And then the question, the second part is, how much of your current savings would be sustainable?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, yes, I think if you take a look at cost savings in general, and here I'm talking about already the 15% we've achieved and up to 20%, a lot of that is coming from services provided to us by third parties, needless to say. And you'd have to say, a lot of that might not be sticky, but what is sticky is always efficiency gains. So when it comes to the application of new technologies, this 3-string design and the dissolvable ball technologies to the other techniques I mentioned to try to improve efficiencies and cut cost, those are all sticky. And so I think what happens as a result of this downturn, and this is probably true for the entire industry, we get better at what we do. We basically reduce our breakeven cost, and we emerge better in terms of our cost structure as a result of it. And that's what we're going to be. We're going to be better because of the downturn.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Just wanted to come back a little bit on CapEx in part as we think about this rig ramp program kind of outline the annualized D&C would be, call it, $1 billion for '16, $50 million of incremental infrastructure that you highlighted, and we can annualize that for '16 as well. Is there anything else, I guess, that we ought to think about in the 2015 budget that would get scaled up with that ramp, any of the other kind of infrastructure or other CapEx that [indiscernible].","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think that's a pretty simple question because if you take a look at where we are in the Permian today, we are at 10 rigs. Of course, and just about this time, 1 year ago, we had 16 rigs running in the north and say, 12 or so running in the south over most days. So let's just say 28 rigs. So to the extent we add 2 per month this year, that gets us to, starting July, that gets us to 22 rigs. And if we add a few more in 2016, it might get us essentially back to exactly where we were last year at this time. And at this time last year, we had no bottlenecks when it came to water or sand or gas processing facilities or pipeline takeaway. And so we would find ourselves exactly in that same situation if it were to be that we were to raise the rig count this high. And that's just us. That's not even related to the rest of the industry getting back to where we were, which was, what, 550 rigs. And so I think the days of having significant infrastructure constraints are -- there's a couple more years pushed out into the future just as a result of the rig count reduction and all the new pipelines, for instance, that are just coming in this summer for oil offtake. That's a good example. And we probably will, as I mentioned, with a Targa, pursue the implementation of the Buffalo plant in Martin County next year as well. So I feel like we have staved off as an industry and certainly as a company any and all bottleneck issues for some time, another product of the downturn.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And so like if this year's current base for the other CapEx line was $250 million and if we kind of just add another $200 million or so to that for the ramp program, is that a reasonable assumption then for '16?","Frank E. Hopkins","Well, wait, just for clarification, that other is basically property, plant and equipment. And that's where the sand mine is. That's where the water project is. So I think that you'll see...","Timothy L. Dove","Explained by the $35 million to $50 million we're adding this year...","Frank E. Hopkins","Well, that's going to be -- that's where I'm going. That will be in drilling and completions and probably be incremental on top of what we have this year that Tim showed you on Slide 6 on our budget. So that's really the increase next year.","Timothy L. Dove","We have not done any preplanning for saltwater disposal systems and the tank batteries for '16 yet, obviously. So I don't really have a number that I can share with you to be very accurate.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay, that's fair. It's a bit early. And I guess on that ramp program, roughly, do you know how many wells do you think you could put to sales in '15 with that program?","Timothy L. Dove","Well, let's see. Let's do some math on it. Maybe I can help a little bit here. We're drilling 3-well pads commencing, let's just say, July 1 and those take -- let's just use the same number we were using, 160. So that's roughly 5 months. We don't see any production from the first rigs activity until basically it's November, December. Let's say Thanksgiving or something. So you're going to have very minimal impact on this year's production. But I think it will only be that first pad or the second pad as well that are producing. And so you may see a few extra thousand barrels a day produced in -- between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but that's it for this year.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. Makes sense. And then last one on the Permian. I guess just Wolfcamp D, what sort of price environment do you think brings that back into the program?","Timothy L. Dove","The Wolfcamp D, was that the question?","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Yes.","Timothy L. Dove","Well, I think, certainly, Wolfcamp D numbers would show its productivity slightly less than the Wolfcamp A and B and Lower Spraberry Shale. And so I think, if you were to say, if we're in a $50 environment, what do you want to drill? It certainly would be the Wolfcamp B, Lower Spraberry Shale wells. I think when you're at $70-plus, you start thinking about D wells and so on. Those -- you also have Jo Mill. You got Middle Spraberry. They probably start getting interesting $70 to $80. So what you have is, as always, a sort of stratification of opportunity in terms of returns and we're starting at the top.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then I guess the last on my end is, on the Eagle Ford midstream asset, is there excess capacity on that? Just trying to think about what might be interesting to potential buyers.","Richard P. Dealy","The answer is there is.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","There is?","Frank E. Hopkins","But there's a significant extra capacity.","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we have. Let me give you an example. You could take a look at this versus our production, we have 780 million cubic feet a day of gas treating capacity. So that's -- and stabilization capacity, if you're talking about condensate, of 119,000 barrels a day, so that -- you can go in there in our materials and look at how much gas and condensate we are producing, of course, our net interest is about 33%. So you have to uptick that and also add on the royalties, but we have substantial capacity in those areas.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions for me. On the shift to the Pioneer pressure pumping services, is there any way to quantify the savings or efficiency gains that you receive by using -- fully utilizing PPS versus third parties?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, I think, first of all, you have to list what the savings are, and I would summarize it like this. We -- and some of this is esoteric because we're in a situation if we don't use the equipment, we'll have to idle it. So just as an example, if we sit the fleet in the yard, it's very expensive, just like stacking a rig. Probably is $50,000 a day because of the fixed cost associated with the equipment. So there is a need, I think, to make sure we use this, assuming it's competitive on the one hand. But the other aspects of it are sand requirements. We do have a lot of our sand provided by our own sand mine, the Brady sand mine or Premier Silica. One of the costs of not doing this would be to get that plant out of balance and would cost substantial amounts of money in terms of storage needs for sand that's otherwise produced but for which there's no market. So we're trying to balance that as well. The other thing we get hit on, and this is several million dollars a year for sand shipments, where they're being provided by truck by third parties. To the extent we're not ready to take sand or not taking on a ratable basis, we're charged with demurrage while waiting for sand -- or while the sand -- while we're waiting to take the sand is the way to put this off the trucks. And so there's several million dollars there. The other thing is we -- we are going to benefit here because we can manage the water transfer cost into the locations we're going to be drilling when we know -- with Pioneer Pumping Services, we were very much more efficient on scheduling. So the other thing that's important is personnel. You can imagine a situation in which we're just putting fleets out there when and if needed versus a level-loaded program where we can reduce over time and also reduce what I'd kind of refer to as overstaffing. And the calculations show we could probably save $100,000 per completion just for the supervision staff by level loading and not being out there in the sense of only providing a fleet when and if needed. So there is substantial savings. I don't -- I can put a bow on the total amount for you, but it's substantial. And another thing that's substantial is -- have a difficulty of putting monetary value on it is our own people being on time, pumping our wells on schedule and Pioneer green -- pumping Pioneer green wells. And so I know there's a benefit of that because we look at the stages per day efficiencies of our fleet and they're better generally than third parties. And so you can save a lot -- if you pump one more stage a day, it can save you $150,000 per well. So there's all these things add up.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Makes sense. And then, over in the Eagle Ford, just wondering on your thoughts on refrac potential and how that might benefit upper and lower development and then potential for down spacing in areas where you might not have previously down spaced?","Timothy L. Dove","Yes, we have done really what I would refer to as a limited amount of refracking really across our acreage. Of course, some people will ask us about that in the Permian, and these are all new wells in the Permian, so refracking doesn't make a lot of sense. But the Eagle Ford, we've got wells that have been on for some time and in some cases, we believe that where we believe we did not get a sufficient frac job, we're looking at the economics of refracking, a lot of cases with diversion materials to reduce the cost. And so we're looking at it, but I think it's only in a handful of wells. I think there's a total of 4 wells in the Eagle Ford we're going to refrac this year. So just not a lot of opportunity that we see that come to mind where this is a no-brainer.","Operator","This concludes our time for the question-and-answer session.

After Scott concludes his remarks, Tim will review our third quarter horizontal drilling results in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and the Eagle Ford shale. He'll also provide details regarding the latest plans for our Spraberry\/Wolfcamp infrastructure prospects. Rich will then cover the third quarter financials in more detail and provide earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. After Rich concludes his remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Frank. Good morning.","On slide number 3, we had an adjusted loss of $1 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the third quarter. What's more important, obviously, we had a tremendous quarter in regard to production growth. Third quarter production, 211,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 52% oil. It was 7% above the second quarter and above the top end of guidance of 205,000 to 210,000 [BOE per day] for that quarter. Obviously driven by the strong Spraberry\/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. That production was up 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 13% versus the second quarter. The oil production actually increased 10,000 barrels of oil per day. What's probably more important is the fact that this growth is coming from only six rigs in the north and a net 2.4 rigs in the south, so really only 81\/2 rigs coming out of the Permian Basin. You'll see later, as we discuss the additional eight rigs that we've added, you'll see that growth coming on late first quarter going into a tremendous strong second quarter of 2016.","Updating 2015 full-year production growth forecast to 11% from our 10%-plus. If you look at the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp full-year growth rate, it was 22% to 24%. We're upping that to 25% to 26%. Continuing realizing tremendous cost reductions and efficiency gains. Achieving already 25% decrease in drilling and completion costs compared to 2014, expect it to get greater than 30% going into 2016. 20% reduction in horizontal tank battery costs compared to 2014. Expect that to be greater than 25% going into 2016. Continue to see reduction in LOE, 18% reduction already compared to the third quarter of 2015 compared to 2014. Continue to see that with efficiency gains, we're continuing to see our horizontal pad spud-to-POP times reduced to 135 days. A lot of it's reflecting the reduced drilling time by seven days per well.","Going to slide number 4, we did place 33 horizontal wells on production in the third quarter. In the north, in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, continuing to see tremendous results from the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp A intervals. 30 wells, they're all on average tracking greater than 15% above a million-BOE type curve. We'll evaluate increasing that sometime next year. Average 24-hour peak rate for the 30 wells, 1,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 78% oil content. 19 of the 30 wells benefited from completion optimization, which Tim will talk more about, 17 Wolfcamp B wells and two Wolfcamp A wells. Again, the average production from all the Wolfcamp B and A wells drilled since 2013 in the north continues to track EURs of 1 million barrel of oil equivalent.","We did close the sale of our Eagle Ford Midstream business in July for $2.15 billion gross or $1 billion net to Pioneer. Received net sale proceeds of $530 million at closing. An additional $500 million will be received in July of 2016. Resulted in a book gain of $778 million before tax or a seven-time return on investment in five years. This is another great example of infrastructure spending that we do, unlike a lot of our peers, and turn it into a tremendous gain.","Strong balance sheet with cash on hand at $600 million at the end of the third quarter of 2015. Again, we probably had the strongest hedging position when you look at the years 2015 and 2016 of anybody in the U.S. We were hedged 90% for 2015, 85% for 2016 on oil and 20% for 2017. On gas, 85% for 2015, 70% in 2016. When you look at what we've collected and what the current value of our entire hedge book is, it's about \u2013 approximately $1.5 billion for the years 2015 and 2016.","Continuing to forecast production growth of 15%-plus over that 2016 to 2018 time period. All growth of 20% plus. Again, due to the efficiency gains and higher EURs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp, we continue to expect to deliver forecasted growth using fewer rigs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp than the 28 rigs that we had previously anticipated and announced. Eight rigs have been added in the north between July and late October. No further rig additions planned for 2015. Currently at 18 rigs, 14 in the north and four rigs in the south. Obviously, the timing of future additions over this next three-year time period dependent upon the incremental efficiency gains, further productivity improvements, obviously commodity prices, while we're continuing to achieve strong well returns. The current IRRs in the Spraberry\/Wolfcamp ranged from 45% to 60% at current strip prices, as noted in footnote 1 at the bottom of your slide. Continue to operate six horizontal rigs in the Eagle Ford. With six horizontal rigs and our modeling over the next three-year time period, we expect to keep production essentially flat versus the third quarter of 2015.","On slide number 6, our capital program continues to stay at $2.2 billion. That includes the eight additional rigs we've added in the second half of 2015. Drilling capital still the same at $1.95 billion. Again, funding primarily through cash flow of $1.5 billion, cash on hand $600 million at the end of September, and addition with our great hedging program in 2015.","Going into slide number 7, again, forecasting \u2013 again, targeting 15%-plus production growth over the next three-year time period, 2016 to 2018. Summarizing 2015, we'll end up averaging somewhere between 202,000, 203,000 barrels a day. A key footnote, going into the fourth quarter with our guidance at $206 million to $211 million, we will have one-third fewer POPs in Spraberry\/Wolfcamp and the Eagle Ford compared to the third quarter. That's why guidance is essentially flattish going into the fourth quarter. Again, I'll remind you, you'll see the major impact of the additional eight rigs late first quarter of next year and going into the second quarter of 2016. Again, looking long term, 2016 to 2018 reflects increasing oil productivity, capital efficiency improvements, strong well returns, and increasing horizontal rig count. We'll be moving up to about 60% oil by 2018. Oil growth will be 20%-plus in that three-year time period.","I'll now turn it over to Tim to get more specific on our horizontal results.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","I'll start with slide 8, and it shows that the third quarter continues our track record of excellent results in the drilling and completing of Spraberry\/Wolfcamp wells. And toward that end, as Scott has already mentioned, we put 33 wells on production, horizontal wells. The predominant number, of course, is the Wolfcamp B, with 28 of those 33, with two Wolfcamp A wells.","It should be noted that, according to our plan, these A wells were drilled after some delay from when the corresponding B wells were drilled. And this will be our plan still going forward. As you can see on the graphs in both cases, the production results are quite outstanding, and we estimate that the early production is tracking over 15% above our million-barrel-BOE type curve, which was just simply outstanding. We did put a couple other zones \u2013 wells on production, particularly two Wolfcamp D wells, which had excellent producing rates of about 1,600 barrels a day in the first 24 hours, and then a Lower Spraberry shale well that we still don't have any significant results for.","The optimization program, I think, is contributing very mightily when it comes to the encouragement we see on production. 26 completion optimization wells were put on production over the last couple of quarters, and if you take a look at the 30 wells above, they clearly are being affected by that. We've seen pretty significant increases across the board when it comes to completion optimization, when it comes to optimizing the stage lengths and increasing the number of clusters per stage, increasing fluid volumes, and proppant. And so the 26 wells, among the total that have been put on production the last two quarters, have really seen significant increases. Actually, in one particular case, we have an offset well that has shown about a 34% increase in its EUR versus the offset well. So it's clear that we need more work and more time for the optimization, and it's also clear that optimization won't be the same in every zone, in every area of the field, but it's very encouraging what we're seeing, to the point where we're actually expanding our optimization program. We'll be testing an additional 50 wells in the fourth quarter this year, as well as into the first quarter next year.","Turning to slide 9, as we've done for several quarters, the graphs on the left depict the actual production from all of the wells that we've drilled in each of the Wolfcamp A and B intervals. And you can see on average \u2013 in this case we've got significant data sets for both \u2013 these wells have averaged roughly about 1 million BOE in both the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B. If you take a look at the map on the right, we've got a substantial data set that's being developed with all these wells and across a large swath of the acreage. As I mentioned on slide 8, it's pretty clear that these drilling results on average are going to increase. Our averages will be pulled up by virtue of the increased EURs per well that we're seeing, and I think you'll see these curves move upward as we move into the future.","On slide 10, the economics of drilling in this field still strongly support drilling longer laterals where we can do so. The table clearly shows that. It shows the cost incrementally of drilling longer laterals and then the incremental amounts in terms of EURs, and the NPV per well dramatically increases from the case of a 5,000-foot lateral of about $2.3 million up to about $8 million for a 10,000-foot lateral. So very significant improvement in the payout and the NPV per well in doing so. As the graph at the bottom shows, it's pretty clear that the higher prices go, there's even a more significant NPV lift that we get from drilling longer laterals.","Our position in the basin is such that the vast majority of our acreage supports longer laterals. And that will allow us to drill, say, 7,500- to 10,000-foot laterals really for decades. As depicted in the cartoonish map here, you can see that if we only had one section by one section of 640 acres, that would limit us to only 5,000-foot laterals, but in our case we have contiguous acreage, in many cases where you at least have two sections stacked north and south, and we can drill up to 10,000-foot laterals. And so we have a significant advantage compared to peers in that our substantial acreage position is contiguous and allows for the drilling of long laterals.","On slide 11, even with the longer laterals, our drilling time per well has decreased substantially over the last several quarters, as seen in the graph. In fact, it was down seven days from 32 to 25 in the third quarter compared to the second. This shows all wells drilled in the Wolfcamp B. You can see the dramatic benefits we get from focusing on one zone and getting better and better at drilling that one zone, to the point where our best wells to date in the north has been 17 days in terms of drilling and in the south 13 days, given that that southern area well was much shorter lateral than in the north. But the objective should be, as we move forward, to move the averages down even further to correspond to the best wells drilled to date, and I think you'll see that improvement continue as we go into the future. A lot of this has to do with utilizing a modified three-string casing design and, as I mentioned a minute ago, focusing on one particular zone, and in this case being the Wolfcamp B predominantly.","And then turning to slide 12, this is an update on activity in the north. As Scott mentioned, we have 14 rigs running horizontally in the north with no plans for additional new rigs in the north during this year. We will be actually POP-ing a number of wells that's actually larger than our original plan, even with adding only the eight rigs that we have since July 1. The average spud-to-POP times are coming down \u2013 this is in relation to the reduced drilling days I mentioned a moment ago \u2013 and I think that will continue as well. I think we're down to roughly 135 days in the north.","The cost per well has come down dramatically. This has already been mentioned, but about 25% is what we see as the cost reduction so far year to date in the north, bringing the well cost down to just over $8 million. And I think this can be reduced another 5% or so as we get into early next year and we see the full effect of the reduction in tubulars, as well having some of our rigs that are under contract today be renegotiated at lower spot rates.","Our program still calls for us averaging 1 million BOE that would generate IRRs at 50% to 60% in the north. That includes an allocation for tank batteries and saltwater disposal. As I mentioned earlier, to the extent we're actually drilling EURs that are substantially above 1 million barrels, it seems in the third quarter, I think we can probably surpass these economics as we go forward, in large part due to the benefits from completion optimization.","If you look on the map at the right, we will be planning to POP about 110 wells this year. 76 have already been accomplished through the end of the third quarter, and most of these wells, as I mentioned earlier, will be focused on the Wolfcamp B, with decent number of Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry Shale wells in the mix.","On slide 13, this shows similar data for the Southern Wolfcamp area, where we have been drilling with four rigs, really, for the majority of this year. I'd say most of the statements I made for the north apply for the south as well, where the results look very, very good. We're seeing strong EURs and efficiently gains coming out of cost reductions. Costs down here are just over $7.5 million, owing to the fact that we're drilling in this area slightly shallower wells, and we'll see cost reductions, I think, further, just as we expect in the north, down to about 30% reduction compared to last year, getting them down in the low $7 millions by the time the early part of 2016 comes around. And IRRs down here being about 45%, slightly less productivity in the south compared to the north, and that results in the lower IRRs. But we'll POP about 85 wells down in the south. Again, the majority being Wolfcamp B.","Turning to slide 14, the results of this outstanding drilling campaign is a phenomenal quarter in terms of production growth. Production grew here 15,000 barrels a day from the second quarter into the third quarter. That was as a result of POP-ing 52 wells, with 33 in the north and 19 in the south. Production was up about 13% and significant increases, of course, in our oil production as well. For the first time, interestingly, we've ever seen in the history of the company, the horizontal production in this field has now surpassed vertical. As we're drilling very few vertical wells and the vertical wells decline, expect horizontal to take over in a significant way going forward.","Scott mentioned the fact we're going to see a slight production decrease in the fourth quarter, flat to down slightly. This is just simply a matter of POP timing and the number of POPs. So we had significant number of wells from our July and August campaign that we're just going to be POP-ing at the very end of the year. And, as a result, they don't have much impact on the quarter. And the actual number of POPs in the quarter will be dropping to the extent of about 30% \u2013 20% to 30%, just with the timing of those POPs. And so I think what you'll simply see is the POPs will increase beginning going into the first and second quarter, and this is when you'll see the production bump. Interestingly, the fact is we're getting to these wells faster, and so what's happened is we've moved some wells we'd otherwise planned to be POP'd in the fourth quarter, those got done in the third quarter. So that's why you've seen very substantial growth in the third quarter and a flattening in the fourth.","But, overall, the results are simply outstanding. We're growing this field % to 26%, which is higher than we had anticipated going into the year. So really outstanding results in the third quarter, and I anticipate that'll be the case for the year as well.","On slide 15, of course our objective when it comes to infrastructure is to optimize the buildout so that we can prepare for the future but also within the constraints of today's commodity price outlook. And so you'll see us in some cases trying to limit what we need to spend on infrastructure but also moving ahead on these projects. So for instance, when it comes to tank batteries and saltwater disposal facilities, we're spending about $175 million this year. Expect about $200 million next year for those same expenditures. But realizing we'll be POP-ing probably about 20% more wells next year, the cost per well is actually coming down by about $50,000 to $75,000 per well to hook up those wells.","In gas processing, one thing you've seen, I think, is the robust nature of the Permian Basin production is really probably the foremost system when it comes to new oil wells and production in the United States in light of the low commodity prices. And toward that end we need to put our new Buffalo plant in place in the second quarter next year. We spent about $70 million preparing for that this year, and we'll spend another $50 million putting it on production in the second quarter. Again, just because it's \u2013 these systems are filling up faster than we would have otherwise anticipated as production continues to be robust in the Permian.","A water distribution system will still require capital. We spent about $130 million this year for a combination of engineering and putting in place right-of-way for the new pipeline systems, laying some of that pipe, and connecting the Odessa water system, as well as other water sources. I think we'll spend a similar amount next year. It will be more focused on subsystems for moving water within our field, as well as developing frac ponds to store water so that we're ready to go in the campaign for drilling in the next few years. We still are moving ahead with the notion of buying the effluent water also from the City of Midland, and that those discussions are proceeding well.","On the sand mine front, of course, we spent about $75 million this year to prep for an expansion. I think that expansion is not something we really need this year or next year; it's probably going to be the latter part of the decade as we determine we need more sand in terms of the demand from the rigs, and when we do so that expansion will cost about $75 million.","And then finally turning to Eagle Ford shale \u2013 that's slide 16 \u2013 we put about 36 wells on production in the third quarter, a mixture of upper and lower targets. We've POP'd about 85 wells so far with 100 targeted for the year. Of course, third quarter production was down slightly. We've seen some well performance issues that really result from changes we made earlier this year. In the face of the need to reduce costs, we changed the completion techniques to reduce fluid concentration, as we had some evidence from some earlier wells that could actually work and cut costs. It turns out, as we look back, that probably had a negative effect on production. It's masked simply because these wells, generally speaking, on day one are choked back, and so accordingly you don't really see much of an impact in terms of the production curves until later in the life as the pressure comes off of the well. And accordingly we really didn't see this till about six months after this change was made. So we're going to be remediating the situation, as you might expect. So, commencing immediately, what we're doing is using higher fluid concentrations. We're also going to be pumping more proppant, shortening the stage lengths, and tightening the cluster spacing, really putting the hammer to this field to get it back online in the type of trajectory we would expect.","The plan still is to continue with the six rigs that we have running today. That's down from nine that we had last year. Six rigs, in effect, is the number of rigs to keep production essentially flat, I think, going forward. We'll have only about 15 POPs in the fourth quarter compared to 36 in the third, and the timing of that, of course, is reflected in the overall company production forecast for the fourth quarter being flat or slightly down from the third quarter.","So with that I'm going pass it to Rich for a review of the third quarter financials and his outlook for the fourth quarter and for the rest of the year.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thanks, Tim.","I'm going to start on slide 17, where we reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $646 million or $4.27 per diluted share. That did include mark-to-market derivative gains of $214 million after tax, or $1.42. In addition, it had the gain on the sale of Eagle Ford that Scott mentioned of $499 million after tax or $3.29. And then $66 million, or $0.45 of other charges that hit during the quarter, primarily related to the impairment of our South Texas Edwards gas field during the quarter. So, adjusting for those items, we're at a $1 million loss, or $0.01 per share.","Looking at the bottom of the slide, where we show results for the quarter versus guidance, you can see that production was above the top end of the guidance that we talked about. All the other items going down that list were either within guidance or on the positive side of guidance. So won't spend much time on those, other than just to point out as \u2013 in addition to the cost reduction issues we've talked about on capital and LOE, we're also seeing our G&A costs per BOE come down. We're down about $0.50 per BOE this quarter compared to the third quarter of last year, and same on a year-to-date basis.","Turning to slide 18, talk about price realizations. As obviously everybody knows, commodity prices were down for the quarter. Oil price realizations for Pioneer were down 18% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, down 12% on NGLs between the quarters, and then offset slightly by a 7% increase in gas prices. If you look at the bottom of the slide, the company continues to benefit from our derivative portfolio, where we added about $20 per barrel to our oil prices because of our derivative position, about $1.28 on NGLs and $0.87 per MCF on gas. When you aggregate those up, that's about $238 million of cash flow that we had during the quarter, or about $600 million for the year in total. And then our portfolio, as Scott mentioned, at end of September, was worth $775 million at that point in time. So continue to benefit strongly from our derivative position.","Turning to slide 19, looking at production costs. Production costs were up slightly for the quarter, about 4%. Most of that is what we talked about on our last earnings call, was coming from the third-party transportation costs going up about $0.75 to $1, as expected, due to the sale of our EFS midstream business. That was offset by taxes coming down with the lower commodity price environment. And then as you can see with the base LOE, you can see that we've continued to benefit from our cost-reduction initiatives there, and we're down 18% relative to 2014 on base LOE. So good progress on production costs in total for the quarter.","Turning to slide 20, looking at our liquidity position, the company continues to maintain an excellent balance sheet, with $581 million of cash on hand, net debt of $2.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Our liquidity position still is excellent, with not only the cash on hand but $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility that is completely undrawn. We did, during the quarter, extend its maturity out to August of 2020. So, overall, continue to have a strong balance sheet, and we \u2013 as Scott mentioned, we have another $500 million coming in from the proceeds of our EFS midstream sale in July of 2016.","Switching gears and talking on slide 21 about Q4 production guidance and other guidance items. Production, as Tim talked about, is flattish to slightly down, just given the decrease in POPs in the fourth quarter and just timing of POPs during the quarter. You'll see our production costs \u2013 we adjusted that guidance down to $11 to $13, down from prior quarters, just reflecting the company's cost-saving initiatives that are ongoing. Probably the couple other items worth noting is DD&A guidance is slightly higher, just reflecting that we'll have another quarter of lower commodity prices. And since we used the trailing-12-month average, we do expect to lose some end-of-life reserves on producing wells, causing our DD&A to slightly increase. Other expense of $40 million to $50 million does include $18 million to $20 million of stacked rig charges, down as we put more rigs back to work, from $22 million that we saw in Q3. And then current income taxes are $10 million to $20 million, really reflecting that we'll recognize in the fourth quarter the last portion of our AMT tax associated with our EFS midstream sale.","So with that I'll probably stop there, turn it over to you, Destiny, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And we'll take our first question from John Freeman of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys, great quarter.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","The first question, when I'm looking at the longer-term guidance where you're maintaining the prior growth rate despite the less rigs, is the way to sort of think about it or the way that you all are looking at it right now is you're you know you're going to need less rigs than the 28 you previously guided to, but the efficiency gains are happening so quickly, the type curve, production relative to the type curve keeps improving, there's just \u2013 you don't quite yet know what that rig count is; you just know it's less, and at some point early next year we'll get some more color on that?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's it \u2013 that's exactly, John, you're reading it exactly right. So it's taken a lot less rigs between July 1 of 2015 and end of March of 2016 than we thought, and we'll give out more details as we get into next year's budget. But really, even if \u2013 I don't see current prices staying where they're at, but if current prices stay where they're at, even under that scenario we would add only two to three rigs per year over the next three years. So with increased efficiencies, getting much higher type curves, we're seeing tremendous \u2013 going to be much easier to hit that 15% target.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great, and then just my one follow-up, when I think about sort of the mix of the wells next year, if we just looked like at the north, where you've got kind of 80% Wolfcamp B, 10% A, 10% Lower Spraberry, should I expect the mix in 2016 to be similar? I mean, I know you're encouraged by the Lower Spraberry, but also don't want to lose any of the progress on the efficiency front, so just maybe how to think about that.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, John, I think the way to think about it is you'll see that we'll probably have a larger number on a percentage basis of A's and Lower Spraberry Shales next year than we did this year. We haven't established the exact percentages yet, but you're not going to see a year where we drill 80% to 90% B's next year, because we do need to make progress on A's and Lower Spraberry Shales as well. We'll get back to you as soon as we kind of pencil in the exact numbers, but I would say a substantially bigger percentage of A's and Lower Spraberry Shales.","John A. Freeman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats again on a great quarter.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Scott, and to the rest of your team there.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yeah, if I could just press a little bit further on how you're thinking about the rig adds and different scenarios. And I recognize that you guys have a lot of flexibility and that you don't have to make that decision now. But you laid out a few scenarios or a few maybe conditions on slide 5 saying that incremental efficiency gains, further productivity improvements, and well returns are really what you're looking for to add rigs, but am I looking at it right that you really want to see more productivity gains from here in order to add rigs? Or, going back to your earlier comments, is it just with the current course and speed on both your operations side and on the commodity price side, that's sufficient to get two to three rigs a year? How should we think about the scenarios there?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, first of all, we're being very conservative on these efficiency gains and well productivity. We're not modeling in the results we saw from this past quarter where we're getting greater than 15% above 1 million barrel type curves. You got to realize the longer we see those wells continue to perform, the longer we see these efficiency gains stay and improve, we will eventually model that in. And over time, we continue to think we'll need less rigs than we're even seeing now. So that's what we're saying primarily. And as long as getting \u2013 the key driver to all this is getting strong returns, number one. I think oil prices have bottomed. They may stay in the $45, $46, $47 range for a while, but we're collecting, as you remember, on our hedges, $20 plus the current price on all of our hedges next year. And so we're just way above the peers in regard to our hedge position. We think it's so important to continue to grow as long as the returns are great. So as we see these gains occur, we'll model those in, and we think we can even need less rigs than we're even showing today.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, Scott. That's helpful. And perhaps picking up on one of your themes there, if I could ask about your most recent batch of these 30 wells that you brought on that are showing that 15% above the type curve. One of the things I noticed on that is the lateral lengths on these wells are more like \u2013 they're averaging, call it 8,500 feet. And so I suppose the question is, number one, is that what we should look for in your 2016 program, is lateral lengths of 8,500 feet? Or perhaps is it even going higher? And the other question \u2013 and this may be torturing the data a little bit too much \u2013 but, Tim, in your prepared comments, you talked about how you put those two A wells \u2013 I recognize there are just two of them, but you mentioned about how you let some time elapse after drilling the B's on the same pad. And so I was wondering if you could maybe, if you have the data, compare how those A wells are doing with this completion optimization to the B wells on the same pad.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, first of all, on your first question, Charles, I think as we move forward, of course, our land team has done a phenomenal job working to put even further adjacent acreage next to our existing acreage, to the point where I think our current planning would suggest 9,500-foot laterals in general on average, in both the north and south next year. And I made the case, as you remember, that that's a substantial value-adder, even compared to the 8,500 feet or 8,600 feet that we're dealing with this year so far \u2013 or in the quarter. So it's going to be a dramatic increase. What I would say about the A's is we have systematically decided to wait on A's after the B campaign, and now that you see us coming back to A's, is what I mentioned to John's question, that the A campaign will increase simply because we're ready for it, having drilled the B's that correspond. And so what we'll say is that we have a limited sample size of optimized A's; that's the two wells that we already mentioned. But they look great, of course. But we're going to need a bigger sample size. But so far, if that's what we're looking at, we're looking at wells in the sense of the A's that correspond well to the B's and produce similarly.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thank you, Tim.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yep.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Kistler from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Morning, guys.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Real quickly, with respect to these longer laterals, I know you outlined kind of decades of inventory, but what percent of your portfolio would you say is applicable to longer laterals, based on the Block E acreage?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, if you take a look at the statistics, it's pretty mind boggling. I think about 75% of our acreage would be 7,500 feet or more. And there's quite a substantial \u2013 I think over 50% would be 10,000-foot laterals, so it's \u2013 I don't have the exact number, but those are round numbers for you that are pretty close.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay, appreciate that. And then when you think about the infrastructure that you've currently designed, do you have to add some increased infrastructure to handle these longer laterals, given the productivity increase? Just any kind of color around that, or is that plan already factored in at this juncture?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think it's essentially factored in. I mean, you're talking about incremental volumes in terms of produced water, in terms of oil. We're already planning for incremental volumes, and as you know, as you've worked with us, on \u2013 our tank battery designs are typically set up for 60 wells, so we've got plenty of capacity. I think the fact is these are already built for much higher volumes than we ever dealt with when it came to vertical wells.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. And then just last one, when you think about that 15% guidance through 2018 and kind of capital outlines, do you think about the D&C cost, is that capturing these longer laterals? And is it capturing the uplift in production in the current guidance, or could we see what you're targeting for kind of the start of 2016, those well costs being a little bit more but obviously productivity being more?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head there. We're in a situation where we will have incremental costs that come from lengthening laterals on a percentage basis. And, as I mentioned, probably going to 9,500 feet compared to 8,700 feet or 8,600 feet. But that's far more than offset by the fact that the incremental production from that will yield a result which significantly enhances the returns. That said, I mean, everything we have built in today is using still the million-barrel type curve results. So we haven't built in anything over that, so that's a significant adder. We're just now getting our arms around, as you can tell, the impact of reducing days on wells and the optimization effect of that in terms of needing less rigs to drill the same number of wells. That's what's leading us to the conclusion that we don't need to add any more rigs here during the latter part of this year to achieve the similar results that we thought we were going to need further \u2013 more rigs earlier on. I think as you look forward, we'll be beginning through time to add into our modeling, as Scott has already referred to, some of these benefits we're seeing, but we're not adding all of those benefits in yet.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate that color, guys. Great work.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tim and Scott, I wonder if I could just pick up on a couple of the questions that have been asked so far. So on the 15% growth target, just to be clear, what are you assuming as your sort of standard well design to get to that number? I'm just kind of trying to figure out, is that an outcome, or is that the target, because there's obviously a lot of flexibility as to how you get there, but in terms of type curve and lateral lengths, what are you assuming in that 15% target?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, so far what we're assuming is type curves that are roughly the million barrel type curves, Doug. And when you take a look at the lateral lengths, it's going to correspond to \u2013 that would correspond to the typical 8,500-foot lateral. So to the extent we're 9,500, it would be a type curve slightly higher than that, so it might be 1.1 million BOE or something like that for a 10,000-footer or a 9,000-footer. So I think you have to look at this and say that will be built in, but all the efficiency gains would not be.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Tim, in the event, then, that \u2013 let's assume that the type curve, as you pointed out, you might revisit that next year, let's assume it comes in better and the laterals end up in longer. Do you adjust your activity level down to cap your growth at 15%, or what \u2013 how do you respond if that turns out to be the case?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, the first thing we're focused on, as Scott has already mentioned, is returns. Let's go on the basis that returns are strong. We would take a look at the combination of levers we have and make a decision about that going forward. As you can tell, we are sort of focused on trying to maintain a CAGR growth rate that makes sense in the face of those returns, but we can land our growth rate essentially on any number we want to depending how much money we spend. We can spend less money if we have these efficiencies and achieve the same results. So this is going to be, I would say, kind of a moving target. We have a goal set at the 15%-plus CAGR rate. We could exceed that if we choose. If we were in a lousy commodity price environment, we could come in under that if we wanted to. So it's more or less a general target, and it will be adjusted to the extent of the number of dollars needed to be spent would be substantially lower to the extent these efficiencies and productivity numbers continue.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know it's an unfair question, Tim, but I guess you've kind of drawn it out by your comment here. Why is 15% the right number when oil's 45 bucks?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, I don't know that 15% is the right number or the wrong number, it's just a target we have internally for the type of growth rate we think we can achieve when the economics are as strong as they are.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My last one is just picking up on your comment about the Wolfcamp A's. So I just want to try and understand, is this going back to existing pads, or is it \u2013 when you think about going back to \u2013 if you skewed toward the A's next year, and if so what are the implications for infrastructure spending? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, in principle, a lot of these A's are following localized B's, as I mentioned, because we believe the right thing to do is come back to the A's from the standpoint of our modeling. You still have some areas where we \u2013 obviously building new pads; on a per-well connection base, as I mentioned, it'll be less next year. We still have other areas, as I said, that we're drilling B wells that are going to need new infrastructure as well. So, yeah, I think the areas where you come back to existing pads, you're obviously not going to need as much capital, but we're still building new pads as we speak.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So in a lot of that population next year, then, is it fair to assume that tank batteries and so on are already in place?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, for some of the campaign, it certainly are. For others they are not.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Doug, one last item. On the $45, you got to realize we do not believe that we're going to have $45 flat for the next three years. So we're targeting 15% growth over the next three years on the strip price case. And I don't think anybody here thinks we're going to be $45 for the next three years. If we did, we would not be targeting a 15% growth rate \u2013 let me say that.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And I'd embellish that sentence by saying we're looking at margins, Doug, not the commodity price per se. We're looking at what our economics are pursuant to the margins.","Operator","Okay. And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Wanted to focus first on production mix. Can you talk to how we should look at the path to moving to your 60% oil objective? And specifically within the Permian, we haven't really seen that much movement here in the last few quarters \u2013 increases, that is \u2013 despite now a multi-quarter focus on horizontal drilling. What is the right percent oil in the Permian and the timing and catalyst to get there?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brian, it's \u2013 I mean, as you saw, the well mix was 78% oil. So as we add more Lower Spraberry Shales, they're up in the 80%s. You look at our peers, they're up in the 80%, 85% range, so it's a combination of what we're seeing the mix of Wolfcamp B, Wolfcamp A's, and the Lower Spraberry Shales. And so it's a slow movement from 52% to 60%, but it's what we're seeing in the model. As we add the results from the eight additional rigs that you're starting to see in the late first quarter and second quarter next year, you'll see that mix even increase even more so going into second half of next year.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Brian, the other thing you're seeing, too, is you're seeing improved gas recoveries and NGL recoveries now that Targa has taken over and optimized the systems out there. They've made a lot of improvements. So we're getting better gas recoveries than we were getting before.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Which affects this year.","Richard P. Dealy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, affects this year in particular.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that would also positively impact, then, reserves EURs recovery rate, or is that not the case?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it does, in a sense, because you're holding \u2013 the lines that we're putting in place are increasing the size of the lines, so it allows you to get more recoveries over time.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And then a bit of a follow-up to some of Doug's questions earlier on. On your capital budget and growth plans, how does the oil price environment play into the equation? When you talked about 2016, you're very well hedged, strong balance sheet, you talked about having flexibility to change that growth rate around and the rig count around depending on whether you have bad oil prices versus good oil prices. What is it that governs your decision on whether to increase the drilling and completion cadence in 2016 versus stay flat at your year-end 2015 levels?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've already \u2013 we haven't really changed our plans in 2015. Just to remind you, we've seen $38 once. We saw $42. We saw two lows. But as long as Goldman keeps putting \u2013 if you all stop putting out $20 stuff, it would help, but I'm hoping that we do not see $20. But I think we're at a bottom. And oil prices are going to move up second half of 2016, and we'll be $60 in 2017 or higher. You'll see us add more rigs if we see that event happen. But, remember, if for some reason we do go to $20, in that scenario we get $20 plus, and we're only collecting $40. And if it stays at $20, we're obviously going to cut back rigs. So \u2013 but if it stays like it has in 2015, I do not see making any changes in 2016.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so I guess just to follow up, then, is it a balance sheet constraint, where you're trying to get to a net debt to EBITDA type number? Is it a CapEx cash flow balance? What is it that you look at to say we should increase the rig count versus not?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have a tremendous inventory. Our number one driver is returns. Second driver's bringing NAV forward. So those are the two drivers. So it's important for us. We have so many locations. Some people ask, are you depleting your inventory in this price environment? The answer is no, it's minuscule. When you have a 100-year inventory, it's important to bring your NAV forward. The best way to do it is to put rigs to work. The economics are good. That's the key driver. So I don't think you're going to see us change in regard to what we've laid out for 2016 at this point in time.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Good morning. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about acknowledging that you're just getting a lot of these efficiency gains, longer laterals, lower costs, and the implication of fewer rigs and fewer wells and the 15% uplift on the EURs, but how is this implicating your view on cash neutrality and the timing at which you think the program can reach kind of CapEx cash flow at \u2013 acknowledging kind of a \u2013 balance, acknowledging a normalized oil price at some reasonable level? Is that part of this calculus, and is that point coming forward in time as you look at your corporate modeling?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think with us or with the industry in general, we've all \u2013 when you look at \u2013 we've all overspent cash flow. But it's been done \u2013 a lot of us have done it with asset divestitures in the past. We've done it with joint ventures. We've done it with equity. We've done it with higher debt levels. Certain companies have done it too high of debt levels, obviously, in this environment. And so in a reasonable price environment \u2013 I think most people predict that we'll be back in a $60 to $80 price environment \u2013 under that price environment, we'll get to neutrality. Whether it's $60 or $70 depends on what happens to the service cost and efficiency gains. We see actually getting to a point to where we'll be spending cash flow and growing substantially. I can't tell you what that is without several other factors and making assumptions.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","But, Scott, fair to assume that better wells, fewer wells to get to the 15% CAGR and efficiencies you're seeing across the program, that every one of those contributes to bringing forward that point in time, acknowledging that commodity price is important?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay, and I guess that segues well into the second question, which is clearly the equity window has been open for you and some of the peer companies, particularly in the Basin. How do you think about \u2013 acknowledging you've got the other $500 million from the Eagle Ford sale coming next year, but how do you think about equity and your prioritization of funding the next couple of years as you look out?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, if you look at our growth rate and look at our balance sheet and our $500 million of cash flow coming in from enterprise and look at our hedge book, at this point in time we see no need, like some of the other companies have gone out to the marketplace. Those other companies that have done it recently, their balance sheets were more stretched. They did not want to take any risk. At this current time, we see no reason to do anything at this point in time.","Stephen Richardson - Evercore Partners Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and very good operational results today. My first question is really a kind of follow-up on some of these prior questions on the low rig count, and hopefully not beating a dead horse here, but are efficiency gains and well performance since just June, when you raised that guidance, the primary change to drive a different rig count outlook to deliver your growth profile, or is it more moderating your activity through the trough due to commodity considerations?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think if you look at the data that we provided, Evan \u2013 this is Tim \u2013 you can see that we've been staring at these efficiency gains for some time, and particularly if you look at slide 11, where we show the number of days on wells coming down. But the dramatic reductions we've seen really have been the last two quarters.","We've moved, if you look back at the slide, from 37 days to 25 days. That's pretty dramatic improvement right there. We start seeing that, and we realize, wow, we really don't need as many rigs to be operating to achieve the same sort of results, and that's a linchpin, I think, on the one hand. On the other hand, we're seeing these dramatic improvements in productivity gains per well. And cost savings as well. So we basically can spend less dollars, have less activity and get to the same answer. So it really, I think, it's really dawned on us really over the last couple quarters as we've seen the confluence of all those factors, and that's led us to where we're landing the rig count today.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's very clear. My second question is somewhat related, but a question on the completion designs in the quarter. Almost 60% of the Permian completions were optimized with very strong results. I mean, can you discuss maybe the primary variable that's changing, such as stage spacing or stage size, and any indications that you've reached limits of optimal? Or could we see the scope for continued rate of change into 2016? And that's not just from more wells being optimized as per your guidance, yet from a continued improvement of what optimized means?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, first of all, when we're talking about optimization, optimization is going to be a long-term project around here, because not every optimization concept will apply to each zone, and nor will it over long areas, wide areas \u2013 aerial extent of the field. And so \u2013 but you're right, I mean, the concepts come in the form of several. One is just pump more volumes in terms of proppant, and the same would be true of fluid volumes. And, importantly, I think, changing the stage lengths, reducing the stage lengths, increasing the clusters per stage, we think is important as well. What I can tell you is we're testing all these different parameters in different wells.","So we're a long ways from being able to say, \"Man, here's the concoction that makes the most sense across the whole field\" and let's say, for example, Wolfcamp B, because we're just in the early stages testing one-off all these different concepts. I mean, you have to use the scientific method here, where you statistically look at offset wells that were not completed with the new style versus the results from those that are completed with new techniques, and then come to a conclusion about what sort of net improvement you're looking at.","So I would say we're early days. I think we'll be continually improving, we'll be continually optimizing, and it's going to take a long time before we can say that this is definitive in certain areas that this is the way to do it. I think if you look at the \u2013 the perfect example is we haven't done any optimizations on Lower Spraberry Shale wells, zero. So we're not even started there yet. And we've done it on two Wolfcamp A wells out of the whole mix. And so we just have a lot more work to be done. But that's our job, is to basically, continually to improve and optimize.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And that process is incremental, going incrementally tighter in different wells, for instance, on stage spacing, versus actually stepping to test a real theoretical limit. Is that accurate?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, I think if you \u2013 there's only a certain distance you can shrink down to in terms of the distances between clusters. And so we're testing a pretty tight cluster space right now, which is I think about 60 feet between the clusters. And so you also realize the more stages \u2013 the more clusters you have, the more you're actually having to increase your cost of completions, right? Because you're in there, if we're using a plug-and-perf method, we're drilling out more plugs, we're on the well a little bit longer from a completion standpoint. And with that comes some risks also. So it's not just a situation where you can just drill an unlimited number and get down to \u2013 get down to, essentially, where the whole zone is fracked, or with clusters. But I can see us moving down in some of our testing even to 30-feet cluster spacing. So we're doing that as well. So it's really a combination of all those things, to try to basically improve.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks. Congrats again on a good update. I just wanted to, I guess, dive in a little bit more on the efficiencies and the commentary around spud-to-POP, and how that relates to the pace of completions we've seen here in the second half of 2015. If I'm doing the math right, a 135-day spud-to-POP implies maybe 115 POPs on a 14-rig program for 2016 in the north. But you're completing, call it, 33, 34 POPs per quarter here in the third and fourth quarter in the north. So if I run that out through 2016, I have over 130 completions. Just trying to understand, I guess, how to think about completions pace per quarter and what sort of additional efficiencies might be potentially expected relative to the 135 spud-to-POP?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, I think the way to think about this \u2013 and here I think of it in total, the totality of the Permian Basin \u2013 this year we're going to POP about 195 wells. I think along the lines of your math, I think our estimates would say us getting to 240 wells next year. So your pace goes up roughly to the tune of 20%. So, if we were out there POP-ing let's just say on average 40, 50 wells per quarter, that goes up to maybe 60 or something like that. So I think that's what you're going to see. But realizing first of all, we just reduced the amount of time when it comes to spud-to-POPs by about 30 days. But even at 135 days, those wells that we began drilling in July and August are just now at the end of the year going to be popped, in the sense of a three-well pad. So you still have four and a half, five months between when you start up and when you're done.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. So \u2013 no, that's helpful. 240 wells give or take on a -","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","North and south.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Maybe \u2013 I think our math would say 175 in the north roughly.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Balance in the south.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And that's on a flat 18-rig program?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, that's the current campaign.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty much, yeah.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess I was just trying to think about also then kind of just organizational readiness for that continued ramp up. You're getting to pretty high quarterly POP rates. I mean, how are you all staffed on that front? Are you fully built out and feel comfortable with that, or is there any additional adds that are needed in that context?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, you may remember, in the mid part of 2014, we were running 26, I believe it was, horizontal rigs in the company.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yes.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Today we're not even to that number, even with the additions we've made this summer. So...","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Still plenty of room.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, so we're not even back to where we were, what's now a year and a half ago, in terms of total rig count and therefore POPs. So we have an organization that's ready to perform at a high level at this rate.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. And then I guess just shift over to the Eagle Ford a little bit. I appreciate there's quite a bit of uncertainty around that program following I guess the light quarter. But running a six-rig program, kind of old type curves, seems like it's reasonably conservative to suggest it would stay flat at 43 MBOE a day. I'm just trying to understand kind of what you have baked in on that sort of commentary around go-forward type curves relative to recent experience.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, if you look at the type curves we utilize out there, they generally range, let's say, from 1.1 million to 1.3 million BOE. And that's sort of somewhat \u2013 we would say maybe 1.3 million historically, if we shave that down just based on recent results...","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","...you might use 1.1 million in the range, but maybe down 10%, 15%. But if you look at the math on that and look at the \u2013 the returns, first of all, are quite good even at that kind of EUR, but the second thing is if you take a look at how that \u2013 we're using six rigs and play it out from the standpoint of three well pads, you can see easily we can keep production basically flat. By flat I mean it could be a percent up, percent down or a couple percent up or down, essentially flat if you do the math on that.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, fair enough. Actually, if I might jump back to the Midland Basin real quick. What do you have \u2013 the northern program horizontal wells, what were they booked at, at year-end 2014? From the unproved reserves?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","You're talking about the new well bookings from a proved reserve standpoint?","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yep.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","That's kind of a \u2013 well, first of all, there'd be an averaging concept associated with that, but the way to think about it is we're conservative about our bookings, especially in the first year.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And so it's not unusual for us to be booking what we think is 50% or 60% of the EURs of the wells in year one, just because the objective is to be moving in terms of revisions upward versus downward. And so you'll see potentially positive technical revisions moving forward in that field, if that's our philosophy.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay, that's helpful. Then last on my end was just on the infrastructure spend. You guys talked \u2013 I think this year you've got in the northern program $275 million for infrastructure and land, talked about \u2013 about a $25 million incremental spend on the infrastructure. Any other incremental increases on that line item that we ought to bear in mind as we think about building out 2016?","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think there's always moving parts, but I think we've covered most of those on the slide number 15.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Like, for example, this year and last year, we did a lot more in terms of buildings, which \u2013 we're essentially done with our buildings. This is mostly field buildings, of course, so that's a number coming down. Of course we're spending a similar amount when it comes to our water systems and gas processing. But when you tally everything up, most of the numbers are there included on slide 15.","Michael A. Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Great. That's helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, wanted to focus a little bit on the Eagle Ford here. It sounds like you guys have got six rigs out there, and you're kind of indicating production can kind of stay flat over the next handful of years at that same level. Just trying to get a sense if that's more of a theoretical statement, or if we do see oil prices recover, whether or not you guys would go in and add rigs there, and obviously I recognize competing for capital against the Permian.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The returns have always been good. We had nine rigs running out there last year. So, yeah, in a higher commodity price environment, Eagle Ford would definitely be a place we'd look to add capital, because it does compete very favorably with the Permian, from that standpoint they are very prolific wells and very high rates of production in the early stages of the wells. That said, what's hurting the Eagle Ford today is the fact that we still produce a decent amount of gas with these wells and a decent amount of NGLs, particularly ethane. And so, with ethane economics and natural gas prices having been where they've been, you can see that it's taken it a little bit on the chin. And so at the margin it's still very positive, but it has a lot of running room to the extent we get higher commodity prices.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful, and I guess obviously good performance update in terms of the well results in the Wolfcamp here and the northern Midland Basin. Just wanted to get you all's thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of some longer-term production performance from the Lower Spraberry. You obviously mentioned you want to increase percentage exposure there next year.","Timothy L. Dove - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Lower Spraberry Shale still is really one of our most prolific zones. As you can see, we're not drilling very many wells in the Lower Spraberry Shale as we speak, or POP-ing them. You'll see a higher percentage next year. But Lower Spraberry Shale calculates to have the most oil in place of any of the shales. It's also shallower. And so it will take a bigger place in the campaign. Of course, this year, we've been focused on efficiencies and cost reductions. And so we're focused on the zone that we've drilled the most wells in. So by definition that's the Wolfcamp B. Next year, we'll be drilling some more \u2013 some Lower Spraberry Shales in significantly higher numbers.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I guess the last question on the rig charges here, obviously that's been happening for the last couple quarters. You're forecasting some more stacked rig charges in the fourth quarter. Just trying to get a sense when those sort of start to go away, if that's in the first half of 2016 or what can you tell us about that?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's generally in the first half of 2016. You're correct.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right, thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. I'd say just two things. Scott, I know you've hit a lot of things today. Just \u2013 I really wanted to just get more on your comment about bringing the NAV forward. I guess in this environment today versus if we were \u2013 I agree with you \u2013 if we do hit that $65, $70 type environment, how do you think about bringing that forward? I mean, to me it seems like you're maybe not getting credit for all the different benches anyway, so I like what you're doing with the B's. So I'd just like to hear your comment about what you guys think, either you or Tim, best way to bring the NAV forward, either in today's environment or if we have where we go to maybe $65, $70 environment.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Neal, obviously, in a higher price environment, the first thing we'll do is add more rigs. That's the best way to bring it forward. And also, as we've been out there talking with shareholders and potential shareholders, Tim and I and Frank have been very open that we'll always look at evaluating acreage opportunities in regard \u2013 we've done that before already in the Permian Basin, whether it's joint ventures or whether it's selling acreage as we did up in the far north of the Midland Basin. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities like that, too, as a funding mechanism, by bringing NAV forward also, so.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That makes sense. And then, just lastly on that point, I know you guys are not actively looking to sell anything today, or nor obviously, with the inventory position you have, certainly don't need to buy anything. But just do you see anything with the M&A environment \u2013 I mean, it seems like prices never really did dip much, and we've seen a lot of excellent prices, I guess, nothing too recent. Just anything you could comment about M&A activity around either your north or south there?","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think most of it's been in the north. There've been probably four to five deals in the $30,000 to $40,000 per acre range. I think the recent two deals everybody saw in The Wall Street Journal, a Chinese company came in and spent $1.3 billion. It was not state-owned. So private company, Chinese company, came in and paid a high price in the $30,000 to $40,000 per acre. The rest of it's been by companies, smaller companies that are trading at a high multiple. They can go to the equity markets and deleverage. So there's been about five deals, I think, so far this year in that $30,000 to $40,000 per acre, which shows it's still the most favored basin in the U.S., the Midland Basin.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I agree with you. And, again, guys, thanks for all the color today.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott Sheffield for closing remarks.","Scott D. Sheffield - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, thank everybody for participating, great questions. Looking forward to another great quarter when we come out in February. Again, everybody have a great holiday and happy New Year if we don't see you on the road. Again, thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude your teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."]}}
