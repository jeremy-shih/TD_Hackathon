All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, we would like to limit the questions to one and one follow-up. This event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, see our 2016 10-K (01:17). This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today with a discussion about governance. As you may recall, we announced last year that our Board of Directors expects to appoint Laurence Chapman as Chairman of the Board at our upcoming annual meeting in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning.","Laurence will take over as Chairman from Dennis Singleton, who is standing for re-election and is expected to continue serving on the board after he steps down as Chairman. Earlier this afternoon, we announced that Mary Hogan Preusse will be joining our board as well. Many of you may know Mary. She has spent the past 17 years at APG Asset Management, where she has served as a portfolio manager, most recently with responsibility for managing all of the firm's public real estate investments in North and South America, totaling over $13 billion in assets.","APG is a leading advocate for shareholder-friendly corporate governance structures and responsible real estate investing. APG has also been one of our top ten actively managed shareholders for the past 12 years. So Mary is intimately familiar with our business, given her portfolio management responsibilities. We are delighted to bring Mary's institutional shareholder perspective to the boardroom and we look forward to welcoming her to our board.","You may also recall that last year, we announced the appointment of Mark Patterson and Afshin Mohebbi to our board as well. Mark brings deep real estate expertise to the board, whereas Afshin's extensive experience in the technology and telecom sectors adds a highly complementary skill set. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity.","Following Mary's appointment, 6 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past four years. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered board. The majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock. Each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company. The board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements.","And finally, since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders.","Along similar lines, we recently added our support to The Corporate Colocation and Cloud Buyers' Principles and the mission of future Internet power to power the Internet with 100% renewable energy. In addition, we achieved our 20% energy reduction target under the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge nearly five years ahead of schedule.","Let's turn now to our go-to-market approach on page 3. When he joined in November, Dan Papes' first order of business was to fully integrate the sales and marketing organizations of Telx and the recently acquired European assets into a single global sales force. This integration was completed early in the first quarter.","These two acquisitions were transformative transactions for Digital Realty, more than tripling our customer count. Given this evolution, as well as the significant share of repeat business from existing customers, it is critical for us to become as customer-centric an organization as we have ever been.","To best capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of us, we restructured our sales force during the first quarter to better align our sales efforts with our customers' buying behavior. Our sales force is now organized into three customer buying groups: Global Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Network Solutions.","We expect these changes will help us deepen our relationships with our customers and fully leverage the strengths of our global multi-product platform. It is still early days and we have a lot of work ahead of us. But we are encouraged by the early results as evidenced by the solid bookings during the first quarter.","In addition to these three sales segments, we are investing in our channel program to support our go-to-market strategy. As mentioned last quarter, we believe the channel program holds considerable promise for Digital Realty. We expect our partners and alliances will enable us to reach customers we otherwise would not, employing an efficient cost of sales structure.","We have important relationships with IBM and AT&T, which are providing growth, particularly in the enterprise segment, which we see opportunity for enterprise end-users to benefit from the services and solutions that our partners can offer to their customers.","During the first quarter, our channel program influenced a low single-digit percentage of our total bookings. In order to build upon that base, we hired a seasoned executive from a Fortune 50 leading IT services provider. Building a profitable, sustainable and growth-oriented partner ecosystem will require focus and commitment. We expect this effort will begin to pay dividends for us later this year and into next year.","Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page 4. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets but so does net absorption, as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines, and where available capacity has been recently delivered, it has also been rapidly absorbed. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears watching carefully. However, demand continues to outpace supply. Competitors are behaving rationally and new entrants have largely targeted stabilized investments rather than speculative development.","In summary, development pipelines are active but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets, characterized by robust leasing activity and the scars from the last cycle are still fresh.","Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. While the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remain uncertain, the current monetary fiscal and regulatory climate is broadly supportive. In addition, the index of leading economic indicators has continued to climb and recently hit a new high while interest rates have leveled off somewhat.","Against this favorable macroeconomic backdrop, the secular shift towards corporate IT outsourcing appears to be accelerating. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup, given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering and our fortress balance sheet.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power, to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with the leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the first quarter were a little over $50 million, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million during the first quarter, including an $11 million colocation contribution.","The first quarter activity played to our strengths. We transacted in 21 of our 33 global markets during the first quarter and roughly 20% of first quarter customers transacted with us in multiple markets. Approximately two-thirds of our activity was concentrated in North America, with the balance evenly split between Europe and Asia.","The quarter did not hinge on any one transaction. The largest single deal was just 3.2 megawatts and colocation and interconnection accounted for nearly 40% of our total bookings. We added 28 new logos during the first quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power. Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions.","First quarter wins included numerous signings from top cloud service providers, specialized cloud verticals and other vibrant customers driving the digital economy. Our wins included new customer deployments in new markets as well as continued expansion of existing customer infrastructure within our portfolio. These signings were both big and small and landed within our footprint of urban infill Internet gateways as well as larger scale campus locations across four continents.","On the enterprise front, our wins included strong customer demand from both IT service providers, as well as numerous enterprise customers that came directly to Digital, including a large U.S. healthcare company, a multinational semiconductor and software firm and a global investment management firm.","In terms of integration, we're off to a strong start in 2017. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we combined our European teams during the fourth quarter. In 2017, we're focused on consolidating our systems and streamlining our processes. You can see one byproduct from this process visible in the face of the P&L this quarter. We have collapsed the repairs and maintenance expense line item into the rental property operating expense line.","We will do our best to minimize any external facing impact from the integration process. In this instance, however, the efficiencies gained, as we sunset multiple general ledger systems, were significant enough to make the changes worthwhile. In addition to general ledger systems, we have also unified our product offerings under a single Digital Realty brand and we expect to go through a product rationalization later this year.","Our colocation expansion plans are underway and we're beginning to generate revenue synergies with customer wins and new cross-selling opportunities. We currently have in the works an expansion of our Service Exchange from eight U.S. markets to a total of 17 markets across our three major geographic regions by year-end. In addition, we will be rolling out Layer 3 capabilities in the coming months to enable SaaS providers on this Service Exchange.","Finally, by the end of the year, we expect to have substantially completed integration of our recent acquisitions into our ongoing operations.","Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $79 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at less than three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. Tenant retention was well below our historical average at 42% during the first quarter, driven by two somewhat unique move-outs. The first was a 3-megawatt deployment in Silicon Valley, previously occupied by an online gaming company, whose needs had shrunk. This capacity has been completely re-leased.","The second was a Powered Base Building move-out in Atlanta. The single tenant customer had occupied the building for 13 years and had invested significant capital to build out a customized data center solution. We were unable to come to terms on a renewal. And while re-leasing this space will require both time and capital, the existing infrastructure provides a compelling opportunity to redevelop a Powered Base Building shell into fully built-out data center product at an attractive cost basis.","Atlanta is a core data center market with competitive power cost and a suburban scale offering would be highly complementary to our dominant colocation and interconnection hub at 56 Marietta. This property is also adjacent to a 1 million square foot campus owned and operated by a top 3 cloud service provider.","Preliminary project footing is underway and we expect to proceed with the redevelopment subject to market demand. Excluding these two special situations, our tenant retention during the first quarter would have been north of 80% across all property types. In terms of renewal leasing activity, we signed $46 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed.","Cash re-leasing spreads were up 3.1% overall with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the first quarter, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above-market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter.","On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the first quarter and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations.","In terms of our first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 89.4%. Same capital portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points sequentially due to incremental leasing, primarily in the West region.","You may recall that on the past couple of earnings calls, we've discussed taking assignment of a colocation reseller customer's PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago. And we mentioned last quarter that we're negotiating the lease to backfill roughly 25% of the space that will bring us back to breakeven.","I'm pleased to report that we signed that lease during the first quarter and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters.","The U.S. dollar's steadied upward march leveled off somewhat during the first quarter. As you can see from the chart, at the bottom of page 10, however, the dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016, given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S. Presidential Election in November.","As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.4% on a reported basis for the first quarter and 4.2% on a constant currency basis.","Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and was up nearly 9% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share was $0.06 ahead of the consensus although the first quarter may be somewhat of a high watermark for the first part of the year as you can see here on page 12.","We don't typically give quarterly guidance but it's important to note that we expect the run rate to dip down in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to a combination of higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense related to promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants, as well as the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May.","In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first and fourth quarters will represent a little over 51% of the full year figure while the second and third quarters are expected to represent a little less than 49%.","We also expect to record a $0.04 Topic D-42 charge during the second quarter related to the redemption of our Series F Preferred Stock in early April. This non-cash charge will be excluded from non \u2013 from core FFO per share.","As you may have also seen from the press release, we raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the outperformance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year.","Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 13. As mentioned, we expect to settle the remainder of the forward equity offering at expiration on May 19. We also expect to realize up to $200 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales. In addition we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends.","Finally, we expect to raise up to $500 million of long-term fixed rate debt. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will most likely look to further our FX hedging strategy with a sterling bond offering later this year.","In terms of uses of capital, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. In April, we redeemed the $182.5 million liquidation value of our 6.625% Series F Preferred Stock. We are on track to spend $125 million to $135 million of recurring CapEx and $800 million to $1 billion of development CapEx in 2017. Spending on both categories ran below expectations last year, but picked up in the first quarter.","In terms of the components of AFFO, we would also like to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, as shown on page 14. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained the improvement in the quality of our earnings.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years. We ended the first quarter with fixed charge coverage above four times and debt-to-EBITDA below five times. We expect debt-to-EBITDA to hover right around five times for the rest of the year.","I'm pleased to report that S&P acknowledged the strength of our financial condition and the favorable industry backdrop as they revised the outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive during the first quarter. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I would be happy to. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So I've got a question about the sales force. And if you could talk a little bit more about the kind of the realignment efforts. Where do things stand now in terms of (23:16) and then how did the sales roles change in light of the products alignments that Andy was talking about?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Andy, do you want to cover that?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Jonathan, thanks for that question. We restructured our sales team in early in the first quarter, as Bill mentioned in his beginning comments. And what we did there was we decided to organize our sales team to sell to our customers in a way they buy, cloud service providers buy differently than enterprises and differently than network solution providers.","What we've done is trained our sales team around these solutions. We've also hired skilled resources onto the team in order to make sure that we're providing expertise and solutions to our customers' opportunities and problems. And we're deepening those skills throughout the year. We saw some positive impact from that in the first quarter, as you can see from the strong sales numbers that we turned in. But we also expect that as our skills deepen and our relationships deepen and the strategy itself takes hold that we'll see continued progress as a result.","It's not an overnight dramatic doubling of sales kind of an impact. But it, over time, will be the right strategic move. And again, we saw impact from that in the first quarter that we thought was very positive. I think it's important to note that we did do the restructuring at the beginning of the first quarter. It was a major restructuring and integration of the Telx, Digital and Telecity assets. And yet still turned in a strong quarter, which we feel very good about.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Do you have a, kind of, a targeted portion of bookings that you would look to be generated by channel partners over time as well as a mix between wholesale versus retail?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","We do. So, first of all, the mix that we had in the first quarter, Jonathan, we were very comfortable with. Other than the fact that we want to grow our channel opportunities significantly over time, this balance of about 60% of scale business and 40% of colo business is one that we're comfortable with and we'd like to maintain over time.","As it relates to channels and alliances, Bill mentioned in his opening comments as well that we did low single digits of the business that we did \u2013 booked in the first quarter through our channel partners. That is something that we're very focused on changing.","I'm not going to give you a, necessarily, a percentage target of our sales right now that we'd like to generate through the channel, except to tell you that we'd like it to be meaningfully higher than that and I think it's probably safe to say that at some point in 2018, to make it double-digit portion of our bookings, the percentage of our bookings in 2018. We think that we can get there.","Change of focus on channels and partners and alliances is a meaningful endeavor and takes new processes and methodologies for working with partners. The leader that we've hired from a top IT managed services provider, who has extensive channel experience, has that reengineering of our channel organization underway. And, I think, starting in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2018, you'll start seeing impacts that really matter in those areas, which will be positive.","Operator","The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to come back to the overall leasing volume in the quarter and then maybe the composition of it. I think Andy, in your commentary, you identified the largest deal as 3.2 megs. I'm curious, one, what the demand funnel looks like, maybe for Dan, if you could talk about it in the context of how it's built over the quarter and where we really stand? And then just within that funnel, what you're seeing, if anything, from the CSPs?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Jordan, this is Andy, maybe I'll speak to give you a little more color on the quarter, then let's see what you can get out of Dan on our pipeline. So if you look at the total amount of signings for the quarter, the \u2013 we had a similar concentration in kind of that SMACC vertical, which is cloud and other parts of the digital economy, which is about 65% of the total volume. What was a little bit different this quarter is that about \u2013 of that component, it was more heavily weighted to other parts of the digital economy relative to just the top cloud service providers. We still had a significant portion, I think, a third of that chunk I just described was top cloud service providers but there's a lot \u2013 there's a whole bunch of other parts of specialty clouds, other parts of companies that are part of the digital economy and have their businesses over the Internet, were a driver.","And then rounded out, the other 35% of the total demand, was a combination of IT service providers and a host of other customers, which I'd probably characterized as enterprise. So, we really attacked enterprise customers two ways with our \u2013 a great group of IT service providers and also enterprise that come to us directly. That mix has been fairly consistent. But it did pick up a little bit at the end of the last year and into the first quarter. And I'll turn it over to Dan, if he wants to touch on pipeline.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure, yes. Jordan, thanks for the question. Our pipeline for the second and third quarters, which I tend to look at it over multiple quarters at this time, looks to have a similar mix to what Andy described that we saw in the first quarter and then what we've seen in the past. I will say that the demand in all areas, in interconnection, in colocation and in our scale business, looks to us to be very solid.","And it's our job to go out and capture that business but we're pleased to have the opportunities out in front of us to go after and try to capture. So the demand funnel looks good and again, will drive those results that you'll see in the coming quarters.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just a follow-up on the FFO flow through the year, Andy. Any insight you could offer in terms of the contribution of the $68 million of backlog that's starting in 2017? And maybe an explanation as to how much the G&A is going to fluctuate?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So, we intentionally wanted to make sure we didn't have any surprises here because we do have a little bit of a funky quarterly distribution of our core FFO per share this year. So we did have a little bit of a pull forward of some good news on the revenue and NOI front during the quarter. We had a positive outcome on a property tax accrual. So, we do see a quarter-to-quarter step down, due to some of those good newses not repeating themselves. And the G&A is going to pick up, based on timing of when we did our promotions, merit increases and stock grants.","And then we do have a decent portion of our backlog that comes in back half of the year. I think, I'm not sure if that's included in our prepared remarks, we signed our \u2013 a lease for the second phase of Osaka, which is \u2013 that property is essentially now fully leased and we've also purchased a land parcel for expansion of that campus. Both the first customer and the second customer that will be landing in Osaka are late back half of 2017 revenue event. So they'll be coming on in the fourth quarter and providing some growth going into 2018.","Operator","And the next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. The first is, I'm looking at slide seven and I'm looking at slide 18. And I'm wondering, to what extent you have the opportunity for this $50 million in bookings to become more of a run rate for the company and kind of help that curve on \u2013 the bars on chart 18, given you have a bigger presence in Europe now, you're growing in Asia, as you mentioned, you've got interconnection as a more pressing focus.","So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how to think about where the new run rate for this business should be? And if you're able to get there, does that change the way FFO and AFFO can grow on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Maybe I'll just highlight some of the components that got us to north of $50 million signings this quarter, which I do think lend itself to additional strong quarters in 2017. Although I \u2013 we can't promise and I can't promise north of $50 million every quarter of 2017. I mean, you're 100% right. One way to generate incremental revenue is to do that in incremental footprint. And I think you saw that in a few pockets of our portfolio in the first quarter.","I already talked about our wins in Osaka. If you hop over to Europe for a second, I can tell you that we had a fairly large signing within a new customer to Digital in Dublin. We had a similar \u2013 existing digital customer that anchor our scale campus deployment in Amsterdam. We also had some wins on the colocation front.","So we had expansion in both U.S. and Europe in terms of colocation signing wins. And I can tell you, Frankfurt is coming online, from a campus perspective, at the back half of 2017. We haven't signed any major leases there to date, but we have had smaller wins in Frankfurt, including a digital \u2013 long time digital relationship, a colocation customer that was seeking colocation footprint. We are able to place them into one of those eight assets we acquired last summer with a 250-kilowatt or 240-kilowatt colocation footprint.","But they came to us, not just because of that, seeking that deployment, but also our relationship and the fact that they could see the growth into our campus down the road in the future.","So lots of positive momentum. New places to sell that could lend itself to continued steady-eddy growth in our signings. And that's obviously what we're seeking. And I don't know if anyone else wants to chime in here on that front.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Michael, it's Dan Papes. So, just to add to Andy's comments. I talked about the balance that we had in the quarter, the contributions from interconnection, colocation and scale. And Andy had mentioned that our \u2013 the deal sizes in the scale side of the business were in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range. We do think that that combination, that healthy balance of sales across our portfolio should provide us, over time, the ability to provide sort of less lumpy kinds of quarters.","But it's the nature of this business, given the fact that some of those larger transactions happen, the 5 mega \u2013 when you get towards the 5-megawatt transactions, there'll still be some up and down over quarters. But I think over time, you'll be able to draw the line in the bar chart that shows a consistent upward trend. And again, I think the balance that we have across the portfolio really helps us a lot in regards to that.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And if you're able to achieve that level, would that be a catalyst for upside in your outlook for FFO and the opportunity for AFFO? Or is this a type of activity that's now priced into your guidance for 2017?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","If you're able to kind of exceed our internal lease expectations and kind of hit the right-hand side of that guidance table on, call it, page 5 or 6 of our financial supplement, I mean, we see tremendous flow through and you see that by the fact of our operating margins at the property level or EBITDA level. So those will certainly be indicators that pushes through the higher end, if not, above the higher end of the guidance. But again, it's only \u2013 we got three quarter \u2013 three months, one quarter done, so we got a long way to go still.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Mike, one thing I'd like to add is, to the extent we are doing this business outside the U.S. and because we match fund, the interest costs are lower outside the U.S. than they are in the U.S. right now. So there's an incremental effect there.","Operator","And the next question will come from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just in terms of the \u2013 I don't know if this is provided somewhere, I missed it in the sup or something. But in terms of the kind of the quarterly pace of FFO that you mentioned in one of the slides in the presentation, I assume that chart is just kind of illustrative, because it looks like a much bigger impact versus kind of the 51%-49% breakout between kind of what you provided. But do you have any numbers on kind of the G&A impact and the property taxes, just to kind of quantify their impact on the quarters?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Paul, we try to stick with the precedents, and the precedent here has been to give annual guidance and not provide the quarterly granularity. And we certainly help to work with modeling questions off-line, if anyone would like to discuss. We just \u2013 given that a little bit of a pickup in G&A, pick up in G&A was like roughly around 6% of our revenue. So, obviously trending towards the low-end of our guidance range. That's going to be a little bit of a haircut. And we also have some capital stack items, which have been not there. The last leg of our forward equity offering will close out in that 2.4 million shares to our share count.","So those items, in particular, are obviously going to create a little bit of a step down from the first quarter to the second quarter for core FFO per share. But we see that being offset with additional revenue from our properties in the back half of the year.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And I could follow up on a couple of line items, I guess. And just my other question on Service Exchange, you've had, I guess, five or six months now that you've kind of been operational in the eight markets and you're about to kind of double that, I guess. Are there any takeaways from your experience so far? And kind of how you're seeing that as a driver of kind of the interconnection and colo sides of the business? And in terms of maybe what kind of customer segmentation is seeing the most take-up? And how material a driver could be over the next year or so?","Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Paul, this is Jarrett. It's still early days, we actually launched in December. And we really \u2013 we're pleased and on track and slightly ahead of plan. It is changing the dialogue we're having with our customers, especially around the broader interconnection value. We can now do that all through our portal. Day one, our customers get private access to the top three cloud service providers from all our sites, so that's Microsoft, Google, AWS and now, Oracle.","And I'll give you just three quick examples, we \u2013 just this quarter; we did \u2013 a global managed service provider is now offering high-bandwidth secure access for multi-cloud to support hybrid cloud for enterprise. So they're winning enterprise deals. And as part of the deal in Frankfurt, they actually required us to have a Service Exchange launch there. There's a global system integrator who is using Service Exchange now to allow self-service for their customers on our interconnection platform in Virginia and multiple sites.","And then there's a disruptive new kind of hyper-converged player who is actually using the Service Exchange to provision in an automated fashion, using our Service Exchange platform in \u2013 on the West Coast. And so we're seeing different use cases. We're communicating that through the sales team and channel. But again, this is really our first full quarter of launching that product.","Operator","The next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. One of your peers this morning talked about an improvement in the New York market. Is that something you're seeing as well?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, I think there was some commentary around New Jersey in particular. I'd say the New York market for us is a little bit bifurcated. We still have fairly dominant positions with their Internet gateways into the city, which is obviously focused on performance-sensitive colocation and interconnection points. We continue to see strong demand, be it 111 8th, 60 Hudson, 32 Avenue of Americas. Out in New Jersey, we're not \u2013 we don't have a ton of available space. We've not been a active developer really in that market given the retrenching of the demand for a while. We did do a handful leasing, but I think you'll see our 2 Peekay Building in New Jersey, that's \u2013 occupancy has picked up in the last quarter. But I wouldn't \u2013 relative to other things or wins we had during the quarter, I wouldn't say that was a standout market for us.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","That's helpful. And then looking at the presentation, it looks like the slide focused on Telx is gone. Can you comment at all about the things that were used to be on that slide in terms of how the business is trending relative to your expectations?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So we sunsetted that slide with kind of the year one completion of our underwriting and meeting and exceeding them on all of our financial objectives. Broadly speaking, integration from the Telx transaction is really down to a limited amount of items. The teams fully are integrated. That unification of the sales and marketing team under Dan's leadership was the final piece of that. We do have to sunset the Telx accounting system, which we'll complete later this year. But from a people, process and systems standpoint, we're almost really close to the finish line, if not there.","In terms of financials, that's really been a part of our success in, on \u2013 in the North America colocation and interconnection business. You've seen that's had a \u2013 we've had a tick up in our signings volume, you've seen a tick-up in our interconnection revenue line item, be it quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year.","We've grown the North America colocation footprint. I believe the total colo footprint is now about a 17% expansion relative to prior to when we bought the Telx business. So we've grown them in Ashburn, and had some wins with new customer there. We've grown them in the Richardson Campus. We've expanded their footprint in 350 East (44:58) Cermak and we're also seeing some strong demand in our 600 West 7th asset in LA. So off to a start, (45:08) pretty much through the chute on integration and continue to track along and be a key contributor of our business despite the slide not being in the deck anymore.","Operator","And the next question will come from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You saw a nice step-up in colocation in North America compared to the prior quarters. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what's behind that. Is it more a function of internal changes at Digital? Is it related to sales restructuring at all? Or is it timing? Or is it a change in demand in the market?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey Rob, this is Andy again and congratulations on your new post.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Well-deserved.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So you were asking colocation signings volumes quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, the $9.5 million number versus the prior quarters, which were all \u2013 probably a string of quarters, which were more like in 6s?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. It's a piece of the colo numbers, obviously, Europe, the addition of the eight assets in Europe. But you can see in our table, the signing numbers are broken out. So they're \u2013 and you still do see a step-up in North America volumes. I think our colo interconnection signings were our highest signings numbers since we acquired the Telx business, a little \u2013 about two years ago almost.","And I think in the history of Telx, it's a top two, yes, top two performance. I think we saw, not only continuation of traditional customers growing their footprint or connectivity packages but we saw a lot of new wins, be it new customers to the colocation footprint or an existing customer going to a new market, both of which not only spur \u2013 that case type not only spurs demand for space and power but incremental connectivity.","So I think those are some of the elements that kind of drove the results. I'm not \u2013 I think coming together as one unified team under Dan's leadership certainly played a part in it. But I think having more time with the full multi-product offering across the globe certainly helps us as well.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great, sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Just a question going back to the bookings volumes and the potential for that to go up over time. So you've got the sales force realigned at this point, you've got a channel partner program that hopefully will ramp up as well and market demand seems to be quite strong, 2x current supply. I was just wondering, to what degree your own supply is a potential constraint. And maybe part of that is, page 38 of the sup, you have all your inventory. I'm curious, how much of that inventory is entitled or is ready to start depending on demand and that kind of thing?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Vin. I would say, we've done a pretty darn good job at, what I'll call, supply chain management, and a lot of that we owe to Scott and his team's success of procuring the long lead time items, be it land, at our many campuses, locations and whether it's in Ashburn, Virginia or in Franklin Park in Chicago or in Richardson in Dallas. We either own or control a significant amount of acreage typically adjacent to our existing campus that really lends itself to our value proposition of having these customers being able to come to our campus and we can show that they can land and expand and not outgrow our footprint.","So we do not see any scenarios where we're really sold out, especially in our kind of core active development markets such as the core four in North America, our Ashburn (49:18) Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley, which is probably one of the tightest markets, we're bringing on incremental space at the end of this year in terms of new capacity. And we see a similar scenario in London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Singapore. Osaka, Japan, now that we had success there, we do have the land, it will take us a little bit longer. So we won't be bringing on incremental capacity in 2017 or early 2018 for that property, but shortly thereafter, with that recent acquisition. So I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of being able to meet near-term and long-term demand.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then turning the question back to an earlier part of the conversation around the cloud service providers. I mean, last year or 2016 was sort of the year of the CSP. This year, volumes for the first quarter so far seem pretty good across the board. But you may be on the smaller size deals side of things. Just curious how the conversations are this year versus last with the bigger hyperscale guys.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, Vincent, this is Dan Papes. The conversations, I think continue to be around growth. The cloud service provider demand, to us, looks \u2013 continues to look strong. As kind of as far as the eye can see, I don't see it diminishing. We do see an interesting mix of deals that are in this 2-megawatt to 5-megawatt range that we brought down in the first quarter and some larger transactions. I see it, I see the trend continuing the way it's done in the past. And it's one of the things that we feel good about as we look forward at the opportunity before us. Andy, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. But...","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Same page here.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And the next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks and good afternoon. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time talking about the overall health of the U.S. market, looking forward maybe 6 to 12 months. We've seen yields across some of the peer group dip a little bit. And I can appreciate that you're not necessarily pursuing the same type of customer funnel but how do overall supply levels look relative to what you would consider a stable run rate of demand?","And then just maybe as an add-on to that, how would you compare the health of the U.S. market relative to Europe at the moment? And I guess, all else being equal, where would you prefer to invest your next dollar of capital right now?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure, Matt. I'll start and I'll let the other guys chime in here. So broadly speaking, I mean, I'll speak to more scale orientation, that's the bigger volumes side in terms of size of deals. The Ashburn continues to be a very robust and diverse customer backdrop. We continue to see numerous signings, fairly sizable signings. Obviously, Ashburn, there is also a competitive set. So we are competing with deals. We think we're winning our fair share, or if not more. And we still see demand being very large and growing and eclipsing that supply in that market.","After Ashburn, you kind of go to Dallas and Chicago in terms of overall size of markets. Similar number \u2013 similar dynamics, I'd say to an Ashburn but probably just a little bit smaller in terms of markets, smaller in terms of number of customers, smaller in terms of some of the size of the deals in some scenarios. And if you head west to Silicon Valley, that's probably our tightest market by far, a much more limited supply.","I can tell you that based on the demand outpacing supply in that market, we've seen an uptick in face rates of deals signed, we signed, I'd call it, two deals kind of 0.5 megawatt each. So kind of small scale or large colo deals at, call it 150-ish or north rates per kilowatt in this past quarter. And I know those rates going back several quarters or a year or could've been in the 130s-ish kind of area. So you've seen a little bit of pick up and that's the one market where large deals seem to be picking up based on supply and demand dynamics.","Europe, as a whole, it's \u2013 we have a smaller presence there relative to our U.S. business. Those major markets are not quite at the same size as an Ashburn, Virginia. But I'd still say that we had good progress in London, especially if you look in the kind of last, call it, six to nine months, all post Brexit. I believe we had quote (54:35) $16 million of signings or so during that time period. We've kind of really filled out our existing scale campuses and moving on to expansion in Crawley, and we had some good progress in Dublin and Amsterdam as well as in the scale leasing side as well.","I'm not sure there's a favorite although I certainly like the attributes of Silicon Valley when rates pick up like that. That's incremental profit to the bottom line by controlling supply in that market that's very limited. But we're seeing \u2013 if you've seen our sup, our returns are little bit higher in North America than Europe and then followed by Asia. Asia is way down a little bit based on the fact that Osaka, where we went in there with a little bit of an anchor de-risking market entry, signed two fairly large anchor deals to round out that initial campus. And also you have the fact that overall returns in Japan are a little bit lower. But I'm not sure I have a favorite. I'll let the other guys chime in \u2013 any other commentary?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Scott here, Matt. Look, I wish we had the luxury of being able to pick and choose where the next dollar went. The reality of it is it's still a lumpy business. And so you kind of have to go where the demand is and where you can do signings and generate revenues on all that.","I would say for the yields dipping a little bit, I think part of that can be explained with there's more liquidity in the industry and more aggressive capital. And some competitors out there are willing to be a little more aggressive as it relates to yields. So I don't find that entirely shocking. And that will fluctuate depending on how supply and demand balances out in those markets over time. But the fact that you're seeing that now, it shouldn't be too shocking of that. But beyond that, I think Andy was spot on, on the differences between the three regions.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Matt. One thing I want to emphasize, though, is, I think it's important to have space in all of these markets to satisfy our customer's requirements. Our top 20 customers, of those, 95% of them are in multiple regions. And another 70% of the top 20 are in Europe and the U.S. And then frankly 25% of them are in Europe and in Asia. So, yeah, it's just important that you have space, we think, where we have it to meet their demands as they arise.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I really appreciate all the color there, guys.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And the next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on one specific market, which is Dallas. We're getting questions specific to RagingWire and the large facility that they just opened up there. And I'm just curious if you think if that by itself could negatively pressure that market, perhaps, for the remainder of 2017 and what you're seeing there.","And then secondly, on the bookings, there's been a lot of focus on this. Clearly, it's a good quarter, I think, by your standards as well as, I think, how it's being perceived by investors. But I guess with the book-to-bill being just three months, I'm surprised that that's not leading to some acceleration in growth. And maybe that's just a reflection that you guys have a pretty large range in your revenue today, it's about $100 million, or maybe it's the churn that you kind of called out that you're expecting in two situations, including in Atlanta. Just trying to get a better sense why when we see strong bookings like that, we don't necessarily see it flowing through into an uptick in terms of how you're talking about revenue expectations. Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Maybe, Colby, I'll speak to Dallas first. So I can tell you that we've had \u2013 I know we had some decently sized wins in the Dallas market last quarter, in the fourth quarter, one with a partner that landed a healthcare company on our campus and then this quarter, we had a digital economy name with a decent kind of meg-plus deal landed on the Richardson Campus as well. And I know we have a \u2013 and that market specifically kind of has some attractive opportunities that we're working on right now with some of our largest customers looking to grow their footprint.","I think, obviously, we're not alone in Dallas and we're competing with RagingWire and others. I think, those are the types of markets where you have to really differentiate yourself and bring more to the table of the customer, be it multiple U.S. markets, multiple geographic regions, a public company, investor-grade track record and 10-plus years of operating excellence. So there's a lot of things we do to differentiate our value prop with each customers and to have \u2013 and differentiate our relationships with the customers to win over some of them, may be in one or two markets, be it just in the U.S.","In terms of the flow through, yes, we are quite pleased with the sign to commence creeping down to just under three months. I think you nailed the reasons in your own question, actually. We do have a range in the revenue line item. We do have some churn, which I highlighted but I would call churn with a silver lining because it's opportunities to, where we can reposition space and make incremental or are making incremental returns on that space and that's, I would say, that's part of the reason that we went with a $0.05 increase to the bottom end of our guidance and kept the top end constant.","Operator","And the next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. In terms of, I guess, you mentioned earlier, on colocation footprint, it's up to, up 17%. Where can we expect that to go over time? And then kind of following up with a lot of the signings questions, will that help kind of keep colocation at this $10 million and higher level given that colocation seems to be pretty steady relative to, I guess, Turn-Key Flex?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Richard, it's really all predicated on our success here. So we've taken an approach to incrementally grow our colocation footprint what we thought it made sense, be it in our Internet gateways, where we already had a dominant presence right in the (01:01:16) room, had a connectivity and ecosystems stronghold and could build out incremental pods for \u2013 to sell colo into all new places, where you put the flags, be it in Ashburn or Richardson and Franklin Park is probably the next stop on the North America campus and Dublin is probably the next stop on the European campus. And I know Singapore is probably the next step on the Asia campus. But we're doing it very incrementally, call it 0.5 meg to 1 meg increments. We're not going to build a 5-megawatt, 10-megawatt colo all, and just waiting to fill it up over a longer time period.","And the other thing I'd say, you have working against in the pie chart is that we do have \u2013 I mean, we're still doing pretty strong larger footprint scale wins. Scale was 61% of total signings during the quarter. And we have \u2013 that part of the pie is growing at the same time. So I wish I could tell it's going to be exactly this but we're trying to make sure we have the offering for the full product suite, the cage or (01:02:17) cabinet up to the multiple megawatts halls. And depending where demand and customers grow, that's going to (01:02:23) get bucketed between a colocation or a scale customer suite.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I know it's very volatile quarter-to-quarter but in just kind of eyeballing the new leases and renewals, it seems like the contract lengths are extending out a little bit longer for the different products versus the last 12 months. Can you give us any color with regard to that?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Two trends, I would say, bigger the deployment, longer the term. If a customer wants to do a massive deployment, with us at least, they want to go 10, 15 years and we \u2013 that's something we appreciate and we want them to go 10, 15 years given the concentration risk of when that one expiration comes due.","So anything kind of call it, 5, 10 years or north, we're trying to push for longer and the customer usually is also pushing for longer customarily. Secondly, you'll see our Powered Base Building renewals, that's \u2013 those are \u2013 just to remind you, those are places where we own a highly improved shell and the customers put on their own dollar the full build-out of the last, call it, 70% to 80% of the infrastructure. They've got lots of dollars sunk in the space and you can see those renewals when they do come through, they have customers contracting for a longer time period than a fully built out suite.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page. One, we retooled our sales force to better align with our customers' buying behavior without sacrificing current period results and we delivered robust bookings during the first quarter, up over 50% from the previous quarter.","We delivered solid current period financial results, beating consensus estimates by $0.06. We raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the out-performance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year.","And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet by paying down high coupon debt and preferred equity. We finished the quarter with our debt to equity ratio below 5 times, fixed charge coverage above 4 times and Standard & Poor's revised their outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive.","Last, but not least, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution.

Following his remarks, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our operations as well as an update on our activity in major markets before opening the call for your questions.","Like most global businesses, we are mindful that current uncertain economic and political environment. However, we believe that data center sector will continue to be a growth area in the context of the broader economy. In fact, our business has benefited significantly from a number of recent trends since the downturn in 2008, including the outsourcing of data center requirements by corporate enterprises, including large financial institutions, as well as the growth of managed service providers.","With our track record of reliability of financial resources as well as our design and construction expertise, we continue to attract enterprise customers especially financial institutions are looking for a data center provider to have mission critical applications. In addition, we are attracting many new customers to DLR.","We\u2019ve consistently said that the great opportunity for our business is to convert the large enterprise users from building their own data centers to outsourcing that function to DLR. While this has contributed to a longer sales cycles in the short term, in part due to extensive procurement processes as many of the larger institutions, it does not represent a reduction in demand. We firmly believe that providing long-term data center solutions to these customers deliver sustained value and growth for our business and for our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Bill. ","Bill Stein \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. To address the concerns that have been raised since we issued our second quarter lease results last week, I\u2019ll begin my remarks today with a detailed discussion of our 2012 guidance followed by a review of our financial performance and capital markets activities. Pleased note, that all per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis.","The original guidance range of $4.34 to $4.48 per share assume that items that did not represent ongoing revenue and expense streams would net out to zero over the course of the year. Therefore, core FFO and reported FFO would be essentially identical. As a result of the transaction costs, including debt extinguishment costs associated with the Sentrum acquisition, core FFO will now be significantly greater than reported FFO in 2012. We estimate that the Sentrum portfolio acquisition and the upside equity offering will add approximately $0.08 per share of FFO in the second half of 2012.","Furthermore, we believe that the delay in the timing of lease commencements will result in a decrease of $0.05 to $0.08 per share of FFO. As a result, we have revised the 2012 core FFO guidance range to $4.37 to $4.48 per share increasing the low end by $0.03 per share and maintaining our high end.","With respect to the changes underlying our revised 2012 guidance leasing assumptions, as of June 30, 2012, we commenced leases totaling approximately $56 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. And we have a backlog of $41 million that we expect to commence during the second half of 2012, which results in approximately $97 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue.","While we\u2019re very confident about our prospect funnel, the timing of the signings and commencements at this point in the year is difficult to predict. However, as Mike said this does not represent a deceleration in demand, rather with many large corporations including financial institutions there is often an elaborate and structured procurement process particularly for major IT deployments. Nevertheless, new customers continued to be a very important component of our growth strategy, contributing stabilized income in the form of long-term lease commitments, while providing additional growth opportunities for potential future deployments at our sites worldwide. We\u2019ve therefore revised our assumption for 2012 lease commencements to range between $130 million and $170 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue from $145 million to $180 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue.","By comparison last year, we commenced approximately $100 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. It is important to note that our revised range of $130 million to $170 million represents an increase in annualized GAAP rental revenue over the last year of 30% at the low end, 50% at the midpoint and 70% at the high end. I would also like to note that our leases commenced for the first half of this year plus our backlog totaling $97 million is just $3 million, or 3% shy of what is commenced \u2013 what was commenced for all of last year.","We believe this growth rate range in commencement further illustrates the strength of our business and the confidence we have in our leasing program. As we stated in our leasing results press release last week we are adding sales directors and sales engineers to our team to address the additional demand in these markets as well as to support the growth for our business and markets like suburban Chicago. To a large extent, these positions are budgeted and have no impact on guidance. We consider these hires to be the normal course of business and a positive indication of the growth prospects for our company.","Let me now turn to the quarter\u2019s financial results. As stated in today\u2019s earnings release, second quarter 2012 FFO was $1.09 per share up 2.8% from the first quarter 2011 FFO of $1.06 per share, and up 6.9% from second quarter 2011 FFO of a $1.02 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, second quarter 2012 core FFO was $2.6 million lower than reported FFO or $1.07 per share.","Adjustments to FFO in the second quarter included termination fees and other non-core revenues of approximately $7.8 million primarily consisting of a $4.1 million termination fee related to the Solyndra lease. It is important to note that we have recognized approximately $1.5 million in rent for this lease through March and receive the termination fee during the second quarter. We also received the $2.3 million fee associated with another lease termination for space that was subsequently released during the quarter.","Lastly, we recognized a foreign currency gain of approximately $1.4 million associated with the repayment of inter-company loans dominated in sterling and Singapore dollars with proceeds from the $750 million term loan. Partially offsetting the non-core revenue items during the quarter were items that do not reflect ongoing expenses. These items consisted of $4.6 million in transaction expenses. The majority of which was related to the Sentrum acquisition, a $303,000 non-cash loss on early extinguishment associated with mortgage loans that were repaid during the quarter and the $337,000 in tenant expense adjustments related to the second lease termination.","In addition, we incurred approximately $30 million to $31 million of debt extinguishment cost in the third quarter associated with the repayment of third=party debt in conjunction with the Sentrum acquisition. Adjusted funds from operation or AFFO for the second quarter of 2012 were $101.2 million, up from $100.5 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the second quarter of 2012 was 85.4%, up from 84.6% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $182.2 million grew by 5.9% from $172 million in the previous quarter and by 17.6% from $155 million in the second quarter of 2011.","Turning now to the income statement, net operating income increased by $7.1 million to $189.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $182.6 million last quarter. Overall, this increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions. Looking down the income statement, tenant reimbursements increased to $60.4 million in the second quarter from $57.9 million in the previous quarter primarily due to increases in utility reimbursements.","The increase in other revenues reflects the termination fees previously described. On the expense side, rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased to $87.6 million from $79.8 million in the previous quarter primarily due to seasonal utility rate increases as well as lease commencements. The transaction and other expenses were discussed in my earlier comments regarding FFO. Our NOI margins remained in the mid 60% range. The slight fluctuation within this range is generally attributable to timing of recording a various one-time adjustments related to CAM reconciliations and other true-ups.","The increase in equity and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was due to the $2.3 million gain associated with disposition of 700 and 750 Central Expressway and office complex located in Santa Clara, California. This game was not included in FFO. Tax expense increased to $1.2 million from $721,000 in the previous quarter primarily due to deferred tax expenses related to our foreign operations.","Lastly, preferred stock dividends increased to the issuance of Series F preferred stock in April, which was partially offset by the conversion of the Series C preferred stock. Finally, I would like to review recent capital market activities. Over the last few months, we have executed interest rate swaps converting approximately 75% of the five-year term loan balance from floating to fixed rate.","As of today, we all in weighted average interest rate on the term loan is 2.29%. This is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk, while seeking to achieve the lowest possible cost of capital given market conditions. Year-to-date, we raised nearly $1.8 billion in new capital. Since our last call in connection with the Sentrum acquisition on July 2, we completed the sale of 11.5 million shares of common stock, which included 1.5 million shares issued upon the exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option of purchase of additional shares at a price of $72.25 per share.","Net proceeds totaled approximately $796.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Sentrum portfolio acquisition and the temporarily repaid borrowings under our global revolving credit facility. Given the amount of capital raise from the stock offering, it was not necessary to utilize the previously negotiated bridge loan to fund the portion of the acquisition price. Rather funds were drawn in sterling on our global revolving credit facility.","In addition to ensure ample liquidity in sterling, euros, and U.S. dollars in future periods, we have exercised a portion of the global credit facilities accordion feature for $300 million equivalent. When it closes in the early August, the total commitment on our global revolving credit facility will be $1.8 billion. We have not sold stock for aftermarket equity distribution program since January. Year-to-date we have sold approximately 957,000 shares of common stock, where net proceeds totaling $62.7 million at an average price of $66.19 per share. We currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program.","Currently, we have $1.1 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes $88.1 million in short-term cash investments and funds has been drawn on our global revolving credit facility, but excluding the incremental $300 million of capacity from the exercise of our accordion. If this liquidity will fully utilize, we would remain in compliance with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities, our prudential shelf facility, and other unsecured debt. During the quarter we repaid consolidated secured loans totaling $36.4 million and one unconsolidated secured loan totaling $25 million. In addition we have a $52.8 million secured loan that we expect to retire in early September. The weighted average interest rate on these three loans was 6.09%.","In 2013, we have $224.4 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities, which we plan to retire initially with proceeds from the revolver. These activities are consistent with our practice of lowering the overall cost of debt. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.6 times at quarter end, down from 4.7 at the end of the first quarter. Pro forma for the Sentrum acquisition, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain unchanged at 4.6 times. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was unchanged from the previous quarter of 3.4 times and a weighted average cost of debt including interest rate swaps was 4.67% at quarter end, down from 4.75% in the first quarter.","Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to add that in response to many of your recommendations, we no longer plan to announce our leasing results ahead of earnings. We believe that combining the leasing and earnings announcements will enable us to provide you with important detailed information on our results and address questions regarding leasing during our quarterly call. As always, we welcome your comments and greatly appreciate your continued support.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mike. Mike?","Michael Foust \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill. Turning first to our leasing results, during the quarter, we signed new leases totaling approximately 210,000 square feet. This includes 189,000 square feet of Turn-Key space of which 160,000 square feet was for leases signed in the U.S. And this is our highest quarterly volume of Turn-Key leases signed in the U.S. in over two years. We\u2019re very encouraged by this increase and believe it reflects the strong demand we\u2019re tracking in our major markets.","As we have said on many occasions, lease rates vary market by market across U.S., as well as across our global markets. The amount of leases signed in the quarter also impacts overall average lease rates, particularly when the number of leases are signed in oversea markets or both lease rates and currency translation can impact results. This way we prefer focus on cash ROI targets between 11% and 14% for our spec leasing. We also look at our current average lease rates by market and by region and compare them to annual rates on a rolling 4 to 6 quarter basis, particularly, in the U.S. where the range is greatest across markets.","We believe this provides an accurate \u2013 a more accurate view of lease rate trends. For example, we reported that for our Turn-Key Flex Solution in the second quarter. The average GAAP rental rate per square foot in the U.S. was approximately $149. Over the preceding four quarters, the average rental rates range from a low of $122 per square foot in the third quarter of 2011 to a high of $176 per square foot in the proceeding \u2013 preceding second quarter of 2011. On a rolling four quarter basis, the average lease rate was $154 per square foot, very consistent with this quarter\u2019s average rental rate, an indicative of stable pricing for our Turn-Key product.","Based on the stable pricing, increased leasing particularly in our U.S. portfolio for Turn-Key Solutions and our strong pipeline of prospects. We are confident that we will continue to capture significant share of the growing demand for data center space in U.S. and globally. Expansion of our co-location offering is on track as we continue to build our leasing and deployment team to address opportunities in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities.","During the first half of 2012, we signed leases for co-lo space totaling $2.1 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. Turning to our lease renewal activity, we signed approximately 331,000 square feet of Turn-Key and PBB space and an average 14.8% increase in GAAP rents. This includes approximately 87,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $154, a 9.9% increase over the expiring GAAP rental rates.","On the square foot basis, 72% of expiring Turn-Key space renewed in the second quarter with an average lease term of 88 months. In addition, we released fully 100% of the remaining Turn-Key space that was not renewed during the quarter. We also renewed approximately 244,000 square feet of powered base building space and rates had increased by almost 23% on a GAAP basis and lease terms at average are healthy at 124 months.","Portfolio occupancy decreased to 93.5% in the second quarter compared to 94.8% in the first quarter. The decrease was driven by the termination of 225,000 square feet of non-technical space, the majority of which was Sulinda\u2019s 183,000 square foot lease in Fremont, California. The same-store occupancy was similarly affected by the Sulinda termination and decreased to 92.9% from 94.4% in the first quarter. Despite the decrease in same-store occupancy, second quarter\u2019s same-store NOI actually increased to $181.6 million, up 2.9% from $176.5 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we defined a same store NOI adjusted for a straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustment was $161.1 million in the second quarter, up from $159.7 million in the first quarter.","We saw significant increase of demand for higher revenue and higher NOI turnkey space in many of our major markets. Moving east to west, in the New York, New Jersey Metro we are tracking nearly 47 megawatts of potential demand, up from 41 megawatts in the last quarter and 31 megawatts at our Investor Day in January. We believe this reflects pent-up demand largely from financial services, as well as from system integrators and managed services providers that support the financial vertical. This compares 23.8 megawatts of available built-up supply. We signed new leases on a number of our facilities in New York, New Jersey Metro during the quarter and commenced on the build-out of the additional turnkey space. We currently have 1.5 megawatts of supply available as well as the capacity to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory in the region.","In Northern Virginia, we are tracking over 40 megawatts of potential demand, up from 37.7 in the previous quarter. This compares to approximately 27 megawatts available supply that\u2019s either built-out or currently under construction. With less than 500 kilowatts or 0.5 megawatt of available supply in our inventory, we broke ground during the quarter on a new 214,000 square foot facility on our Ashburn campus. The building shell and core is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012, followed by the first three 1125 KW data centers, Turn-Key datacenters to be delivered in the second quarter of 2013.","Dallas remains very active market for us with limited available built-out supply. We have identified currently 29 megawatts of potential demand compared to about 8 megawatts of built-out supply. Our current supply consists of only 960 kilowatts or 0.96 megawatts of co-location space available at our 2323 Bryan facility in downtown Dallas. In response, during the quarter we broke ground on two new buildings on our Richardson campus. Each building will total approximately 120,000 square feet and will be capable of supporting 6.75 megawatts of IT capacity. The building shell and core is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012 followed by the first two 1125 KW Turn-Key data centers to be delivered in the first quarter of 2013.","In Silicon Valley, demand has increased significantly for the second quarter in a row to nearly 27 megawatts of identified potential demand, and that\u2019s up from about 12.8 megawatts on our last call. We are flexing the demand fluctuations in the Valley that are dramatic and sometimes be difficult to predict, but we are seeing a very positive trend here. We delivered a new Turn-Key pod during the quarter, bringing our total availability to approximately 1.7 megawatts, with 2.2 megawatts currently under construction. Like New Jersey, with our existing redevelopment inventory, we have the capacity to culminate virtually any requirement and are poised to develop new buildings with entitlements.","I would like to conclude with few comments regarding the success for acquisitions program. We acquired three properties in the U.S. during the quarter, including two income producing assets and an average un-leveraged cash cap rate of 8.5%, in line with the higher end of our guidance. We also expanded our footprint in the greater Chicago market with the acquisition of the significant redevelopment property in the suburban metro. Internationally, we entered the very important Hong Kong market by completing the acquisition of a redevelopment facility with our joint venture partner, Savvis.","And finally, we completed the acquisition of the Sentrum portfolio in London on July 11. With Sentrum not only do we acquire top five facilities of the very strong tenant base, but we welcome into the Digital Realty family a strong team of professionals who operate the portfolio. This expert team provides us with additional strength and scale to take advantage of the market opportunities in London and in Europe more effectively. Including the Sentrum properties, we expect our European portfolio to contribute approximately $187 million U.S. on an annualized rental revenue basis, representing almost 20% of our total portfolio. Our European portfolio consists of 18 properties across six major markets totaling 2.1 million square feet. Approximately 54% of which serves the important Greater London market.","We currently are tracking nearly 55 megawatts of potential demand in London, which includes a number of fairly large requirements. This compares to 20.5 megawatts of supply, that\u2019s currently either built or under construction. Including our 1 megawatt of available built-out space in the Sentrum portfolio, we have a total of 2.9 megawatts of currently built-out availability in London Metro at DLR.","Similar to the U.S., the sale cycle can be long and difficult to predict selling to large international enterprises. However, we are very well-positioned to capture significant portion of this demand while the combination of our move-in ready space and construction-ready redevelopment inventory. This was clearly unusual quarter for us in terms of our acquisition activity and illustrates the expertise and capacity of our team to underwrite and negotiate complex transactions.","These strategic acquisitions enable us to grow our business in new markets and expand our footprint in other legacy markets while providing attractive returns for our shareholders. We\u2019re very proud of these accomplishments and attribute them to the talent and dedication of our team. We also would like to thank our shareholders for your continued support and look forward to sharing our growing success with you.","This concludes my formal remarks. We\u2019ll now open the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of George Auerbach.","George Auerbach","Great. Thanks very much. Hi, guys. I just wanted to touch on the slowdown in enterprise leasing. I guess, at sort of what point in the spring did you start to see those trends pull back, and maybe how was this experience different than past cycles, in dealing with the large tenants?","Michael Foust","Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anyone pull back in requirements. In fact, we are seeing the actual amount of enterprise requirements, especially in major markets like New York and London actually growing. There are large requirements in many cases. And so we see the potential \u2013 funnel of potential requirements actually as larger now than they were previously. So, \u2013 but it is saying a longer timeframe, when you are working with larger enterprises and that certainly offset by the leasing we are doing with smaller requirements, they maybe big companies and with the managed services and cloud providers, who are often times, move more quickly than some of the larger enterprises.","George Auerbach","I guess two follow-ups. First, I guess maybe the question should have been, at what point do you see the sales cycle start to lengthen out, maybe a demand issue, it\u2019s more on the timing from discussions to signings? At what point did tenants start to become more hesitant to sign leases? And also, it sounds like the mix of tenants is changing a bit more \u2013 more corporate than managed services. Are there any tenants within the corporate side that you see are being a bit more skittish or cautious at this time?","Michael Foust","No. On the contrary, we\u2019re seeing more potential demand from the large enterprise users, especially looking to create more efficiencies and lower their operating costs, often times looking to get the data centers out of high-rise office buildings or suburban office locations into proper mission-critical facilities that have the power backup, mechanical system backup, and resiliency that they require and also be to allow them to be able to expand as I need to expand. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more and this is kind of real \u2013 I\u2019m putting my finger in the air here as to timeframe, so maybe where we saw a 6 to 9-month timeframes. Those timeframes are can be 6 to 12 months working with customers. And that\u2019s a guess, but yeah, we are seeing larger potential requirements that we are almost uniquely positioned to acquire, because we have the professional team with the engineering staff, the design staff, construction, technical operations facility staff. So, we are really well-positioned to serve these large customers.","George Auerbach","Okay. And I guess just last, Bill, on the straight line rent, it went from $15 million change to $19 million and change this quarter. Is that a better run rate to use going forward or was that impacted by the Solyndra lease termination?","Bill Stein","That wouldn\u2019t have been affected by the Solyndra lease termination. I think there might have been one or two deals in the quarter that had some free rent that affected the free rent in the quarter.","George Auerbach","So, we should expect sort of burn down towards $15 million again?","Bill Stein","I think that $15 million is better \u2013 better rate.","George Auerbach","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman.","Jamie Feldman","Great, thank you. Focusing on the terminations for a minute, I know you had mentioned Solyndra, can you first talk about the plans for that space, I think you said non-technical. But then I guess bigger picture, what are you seeing in terms of your actual technical tenants taking lease terminations and moving out and kind of where are they going if anywhere, and in what markets?","Michael Foust","Sure. For the \u2013 regarding Solyndra, that\u2019s a two building property, very highly improved clean room manufacturing. And so they are pretty highly improved facilities. So, we think that this is an attractive facility either sell to a user or lease to someone in Silicon Valley who can utilize this kind of space. So, we think this is a pretty valuable space and we can be positioned to lease that out at very competitive rates for the improvements. In terms of other, we have very, very few terminations. I mean, I think, we had one or two this quarter of data center tenants and those that we initiated those in order to put in longer term tenants.","One was a \u2013 we have a tenant in Dallas who wasn\u2019t fully utilizing their space, and we had no space in Dallas. And we had another, a brand new customer who wanted to lease space with us in Dallas on a ten-year basis. We were able to trade out two years remaining for a ten-year lease at significantly higher overall rents. So, I give credit to our asset management team for being really creative and being able to take advantage of \u2013 and the work to negotiate really interesting deals and allow us to add to the overall value of the portfolio, pretty significantly in that case. So, it\u2019s not very typical that we would do that, but where we can add significant value to the asset, we\u2019ll be creative about doing those kinds of transactions.","Jamie Feldman","Yeah. I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is are you seeing instances that in certain markets where tenants are just trying to \u2013 or competitors are trying to poach tenants with a more attractive options?","Michael Foust","No. No, that\u2019s rarely the case. It\u2019s very expensive and awkward in most cases for customers to move. The switching costs in other words are high and it\u2019s very disruptive to operations. And also tenants have had a very good operating history with us and that five, nines of uptime represents a very high level of resiliency and security in the operation. So, we continue to have a very high level of renewals.","Bill Stein","Jamie, just to be clear to, the facility in the East Bay and Fremont that we leased to Solyndra is not a data center. It was a not data center. It was owned by GI Partners prior the IPO. So, it\u2019s a legacy property. And I think at this point most it\u2019s likely to be disposed.","Jamie Feldman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if we could from a housekeeping perspective get what the backlog was at the end of Q1. And then in terms of the acquisition of Sentrum, I was wondering if you could give us a sense as to what the run rate revenue was out of that asset. And just I\u2019m trying to understand how the inclusion of that might change the margin profile. And in terms of the lease commencements looking forward, are any \u2013 is there any expectation of new lease commencements within that asset? Thank you.","Michael Foust","Sure. Focusing on Sentrum, actually the operating margins are high in that portfolio. There are very efficient buildings. So, while our current NOI margin in our broader portfolio is in the mid-60s. Off the top of my head, I believe that Sentrum NOI margin is in the mid-70s I believe. But I would have to go back and get the exact number. But it\u2019s definitely higher than in the rest of our portfolio, so definitely have a positive uptick in that regard. We are clearly expecting to achieve additional leasing especially at the Woking property, which is the largest of the three buildings and the latest one to come online were we have potentially a couple of 100,000 square feet of space that we can build out for four new users and there is definitely a funnel of customers for that space with whom we are in discussions currently. I have to go back and look at what the revenue \u2013 operating revenue was from the Sentrum, I don\u2019t have that number at the tip of my figures.","Bill Stein","I think it\u2019s about 108.5, 108.5.","Michael Foust","U.S.?","Bill Stein","Yes, U.S. dollar.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Great, I guess with my question about the leasing was, is that you made an adjustment here on your lease commencements expectation for the year. I think you did a very nice job of explaining that, but I am wondering as the number came down if there was any add back for particularly lease commencement in Sentrum so, trying to get like a sort of organic-to-organic compare?","Michael Foust","Yeah. No, we have not added any potential from Sentrum.","Bill Stein","Yeah, there is no Sentrum in the forecast right now.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Alright, super, thanks a lot. I appreciate taking the questions.","Michael Foust","Thank you, Jon, though we do have activity on that aspect.","Jonathan Schildkraut","I understand.","Michael Foust","It just wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t part of forecasting process because of when it closed, it probably will be in the next quarter.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler.","Jordan Sadler","Thanks and good morning out there. Bill, could you clarify you said in your guidance there is $0.08 contribution from Sentrum and the larger than originally anticipated equity offering so, it\u2019s those two factors combined assuming the rest of the portfolio is financed on the line would contribute to $0.08 contribution for the second half. Is that the way to think about it?","Bill Stein","That\u2019s right, I totally understand your question, but\u2026","Jordan Sadler","How do you get the $0.08 contribution?","Bill Stein","We upsize the equity offering from $600 million to $800 million so, the $0.08 reflects the additional $200 million of equity that was raised so, they will probably be another \u2013 probably $0.10 of accretion if we had issued just a $600 million worth of equity.","Jordan Sadler","Okay.","Bill Stein","Is that your question?","Jordan Sadler","Yeah, I mean the portfolio, so basically if you are layering from modeling perspective you are layering that in that $1.1 billion acquisition. It will be financed with an $800 million net equity offering and the rest of the financing would be drawn off the line, the credit or the term loan?","Bill Stein","That the line of credit. That\u2019s fine, I think as a practical matter sometime in the fourth quarter probably mid-quarter we will be going to market in the sterling bond market to hopefully issue 10-year debt and I think the rates will be same it was at least that\u2019s what they look like today.","Jordan Sadler","And what size would be an all euro your offering there be, you think.","Bill Stein","Yeah, I think a minimum just for liquidity would be \u00a3250 million.","Jordan Sadler","\u00a3250 million, and the other question I would have, this is a follow-up there, is just on the offering I\u2019m curious what the remaining capital requirement are for the year in terms of the remaining capital spend as well as any additional acquisitions you have keyed up.","Bill Stein","There are a couple of acquisitions that I guess it\u2019s fair to say under our LOI. So, we would hope that they would close and I think there are roughly a $100 million maybe a little more than $100 million and the CapEx I think.","Jordan Sadler","Of the seven \u2013 you got 700 and 900 in the guidance, how much is left to spend there?","Bill Stein","I would just assume that half has been spent to-date, take the midpoint 800.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And that would be financed how? You just on the line of credit you think?","Bill Stein","Off the line initially, I mean that the debt to EBITDA as I said \u2013 is in pretty good shape, so, I don\u2019t see any additional equity this year unless we do another large portfolio acquisition. So, it would be off the line and then a combination of various fixed income instrument, so sterling bonds potentially U.S. bonds as we have enough balance on the revolver. And the preferred stock market continues to look attractive as well, the rates on the preferred stock.","Jordan Sadler","That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Lastly on the leverage target, you\u2019re trying to stay under five times debt to EBITDA or 5.5?","Bill Stein","We\u2019re targeting 5 to 5.5, I mean we\u2019re okay, but we\u2019re happy to be in the mid 4s as well.","Jordan Sadler","Thank you.","Bill Stein","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson.","Rob Stevenson","Hi good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about the joint venture acquisition in Hong Kong with Savvis? What you guys spent on that and what you guys anticipate spending on the redevelopment. And whether or not you\u2019re looking to do additional projects with them in Asia as well?","Michael Foust","Sure. The Hong Kong, as you might guess is really one of the major financial hubs of the world and thus one of the major financial datacenter markets in the world. So, we see significant opportunity there with Savvis as our partner. So, Savvis can deliver over the managed services and cloud services out of the datacenter, which are definitely in high demand and we can also be leasing space on a more wholesale basis, if you will to the enterprise. And we\u2019re essentially a 50-50 joint venture with them. Certainly, we welcome the opportunity to do more in the region on that basis and we think that\u2019s going to be a really great project for us, we\u2019re redeveloping an existing industrial building and I think we\u2019re going to even be able to add on more power capacity by adding another load to the building, which is a real track of value add opportunity for us that our team is able to put together and working to finalize the entitlements of permit on that.","Overall, we\u2019re not giving out the amounts of budgets on this project specifically it is a bit proprietary at this point and also the fact that we are in a joint venture with Savvis. We want to be a cognizant of their sensitivities around disclosing information from the joint venture. So, at some point we will provide more details on this project as we\u2019re about to bring forward the first part for lease.","Rob Stevenson","","I guess a question is what at this point is the size when you add the floor and do everything else, what in terms of square foot or megawatts is that asset expected to be full build out.","Michael Foust","Yeah, I think we\u2019ll be able to get somewhere between 6 and 7 megawatts of IT load in that facility.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And is construction cost in that market similar to Singapore?","Michael Foust","Cost maybe a little bit less in Hong Kong on the actual construction. Land is always a challenge \u2013 we\u2019re on long-term ground lease, but we may be a little more efficient on development costs than in Singapore.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then just lastly, while we\u2019re in Asia, you talked about what \u2013 where leasing there in Singapore is going relative to expectations?","Michael Foust","Yeah, we\u2019re actually a little bit ahead of our original pro forma timelines. We\u2019re about 65% leased on the data center, the Jurong township data center. And really good \u2013 really good funnel of prospective tenants there and as it my guess, similar to the tenants that we\u2019ve already signed up and it\u2019s a nice mixture of international financial institutions as well as the international managed services and some network providers as well. So, we are very bullish on the Singapore market. I think between Singapore some of new leasing prospects in both, Sydney and Melbourne, Hong Kong, Asia-Pac, is going to be a really exciting region for us and we\u2019ll have a good material addition to our growth in the coming years.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman.","Michael Bilerman","Hi, good morning there. I\u2019m on the phone with many Quarterman as well. Can you just provide a little bit more color, so you talked about $6 million to $10 million or I guess $0.05 to $0.08, which would be the dilution effect away from the commenced leases being pushed out? And then you\u2019re looking at the amount of commenced dollars, you reduced the range to a midpoint of 150, that was from 162.5, and that's revenue. So, the NOI impact on an annualized basis would only be like $8.5 million to $9 million bucks. And so, I'm trying to figure out how guidance would go down by so much, if that's all that was just \u2013 that\u2019s been pushed out completely.","How much was it a delay in the second half commencements versus a delay in the first half commencements that didn't start as you thought you would, right. So, you did $56 million in the first half, did you think you we're going to do 70, and you just sort of fell short versus now you are expecting to do 94 of annualized revenue commencements in the second half of which you already have 41 of backlog and that\u2019s down from 107, when does that 94 start? Did you think it was going to start at the end of the third quarter and now it\u2019s going to start all at the end of the fourth quarter? Can you sort of just bridge all the numbers together?","Bill Stein","Well, firstly all of that it is in the second quarter or second half, I'm sorry not the first half. There was one deal in the first half that delayed, that actually we thought was going to commence last year, and that was with a large bank, much like your own, but not yours. I would say virtually all of it is second half.","Michael Bilerman","And so how do you \u2013 how do you reduce FFO by $6 million to $10 million push out $13 million of commencements on an annualized basis of revenue. How much of a delay shift is this causing and maybe you can breakdown that $94 million in terms of when does it commence between quarter and the timing in the quarter?","Bill Stein","I don\u2019t have that handy in terms of when in the quarter and I can\u2019t really tell you what the specific delay is for these commenced leases, but this was bottoms up approach.","Michael Bilerman","But it sounds like\u2026","Bill Stein","Yeah.","Michael Foust","I think it\u2019s important note, the amount of increase year-over-year has been pretty steady and so the revenue growth and earnings growth continues to be good and it might be delay and it might be our people fully taking account the additional shares and the timing of that.","Michael Bilerman","I know, but if that is being reduced for the commencements by $8 million at the midpoint, $8 million right, so $12 million of annualized \u2013 of impact from a revenue perspective for the full year that would imply significant push back of what these start commenced leases are or that you\u2019ve baked in more of a cushion and saying $6 million to $10 million of FFO because I\u2019m just having a hard time from \u2013 if you\u2019ve only pushed out $13 million of commenced leases things must have been really delayed until late into the year?","Bill Stein","It is delayed until late in the year. Make sure, you take by the way the margins, it\u2019s about 65%.","Michael Bilerman","Right. I grossed out the FFO impact for 65%. And how much more backlog you mentioned $41 million backlog for the second half, how much more backlog you assigned, but not commenced going forward into \u201813 and \u201814?","Bill Stein","About $26 million for 2013.","Michael Bilerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin.","Jonathan Atkin","I wanted to circle back a little bit on that segue from Sentrum into kind of Europe. Europe, I think is 80% \u2013 50% or more way into the UK, and I wondered if you feel like that\u2019s the right mix or if there are other markets that you begin to focus on from an M&A or new development perspective? And then with respect to Asia, you commented how strong the demand is and I wondered if you could share some perspectives on whether you\u2019ve seen any change in the competitive environment?","Michael Foust","Sure. Well, in Europe we always focused on these major markets, where we see a lot of enterprise activity and activity from the IT services world. Certainly in our minds, right now, London and Amsterdam, and to some extent, Dublin, because of all the international companies, many U.S. companies in Dublin are interesting places for data center. Certainly, London being the largest potential market, Amsterdam next, Dublin after that of markets that we are in, where we see potential for growth. Paris, I think will be a good market. We are taking it more slowly. We are almost \u2013 we are virtually fully let in Paris. We\u2019re going to take a little bit slower tact on that market to see how things progress economically over the second half of the year, but Paris is a nice market, because there is a lot corporate entities, including financials, but not necessarily financials that make up the typical marketplace there.","One market that we are not in, that we would like to be in would be Frankfurt. And that common theme of very important financial center, where we are seeing demand for data centers, especially as the financial institutions are consolidating out of office buildings, out of older facilities that they are not capable of expanding, and so Frankfurt would be a very interesting market that we are not in that we would like to be in Europe.","Asia-Pac, like most markets, it\u2019s, from a competitive perspective, it\u2019s very fragmented. You don\u2019t have, while these are mature economic markets, they are not mature from a data center perspective, so I think we have a good early mover advantage in these markets, especially being positioned as we are to be able to finance and execute instantly on these very large projects without having to look for secured debt, and that puts us in a competitive advantage, especially vis-\u00e0-vis you\u2019re more kind of private developer type competitors that pop-up market-by-markets. So, we think we\u2019re in a very good position both from spec leasing perspective with spec projects as well as very well-positioned for potential build-to-suit opportunities with some of these larger institutions.","Jonathan Atkin","And then just on the colo business, I know that\u2019s non-core but can you share which markets you are doing the most business in that line?","Michael Foust","Sure. San Francisco is the very important market for us. Dallas is growing. St Louis, I think as a regional market, we are going to see a lot of traction there. In Boston and New York Metro, those would be the most active markets where we are in. As a reminder, we are doing colo in existing buildings of ours that are network-rich buildings, usually the internet gateways, like in Dallas, 2323 Bryan, where we have space and power capacity and network capacity.","Jonathan Atkin","And then, can you talk about the average footprint in your core wholesale business, the average size or requirement you are bringing in and do that very significantly by market?","Michael Foust","Yeah. I mean \u2013 and this is a very rough qualitative comment. We are seeing 1 to 2 megawatts to start is pretty typical. That might be 10,000 to 20,000 feet maybe a little larger on a rentable square foot basis, but boy, it can run the gamut of 5,000 feet to 30, 40, 50. But I would say if there was kind of a median probably around that 1 to 2 megawatts.","Jonathan Atkin","Are there geographic trends that you could kind of point to in terms of where it could falls at the lower end versus the larger end of that range?","Michael Foust","Not really.","Jonathan Atkin","Great, thank you very much.","Michael Foust","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Paul Morgan.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning. Just on the development CapEx spend, I mean you still have the same range for the year, we\u2019ve only got five months left to get for the $700 million to $900 million, I mean, is there any particular reason for having the same range? Is any of the gap between bottom and the high end of the range related to the kind of the least commencement timing issues or is it anything else?","Michael Foust","No. I think it\u2019s just kind of the way the construction projects, development projects have been commenced and scheduled. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not tied directly to leasing.","Paul Morgan","There is no more visibility now.","Michael Foust","Well, in many cases, we are developing product, so we have product to lease and for revenues next year is a lot of what we are up to.","Paul Morgan","I guess another way to think is it\u2019s kind of what would make you kind of hit the high end as opposed to the low end or are there particular markets or kind of leasing that would be a catalyst for the need for future space?","Michael Foust","I think it\u2019s more the how fast our people are deploying their current budgets.","Paul Morgan","Okay. And then just kind of one more last hit at the sales cycle issue, you mentioned something about financials and I just wondered if you could maybe characterize \u2013 I mean, is the longer duration of the decision process concentrated in a vertical? I mean, you mentioned the enterprise, about kind of within enterprise, I mean, how much of it could be related to financials and just kind of the broader issues in that vertical versus a just a broader trend of more complex deals in longer planning horizon?","Michael Foust","I think it\u2019s a latter. I think it\u2019s more general with large enterprises. There is a lot of different constituents, because it\u2019s not just the rent, it\u2019s not just the lease, it\u2019s the IT applications, their design, network, you\u2019ve got budgets coming from different departments often times into these projects and because of the high ticket, especially after the recession, capital expenditures and operating expenditures are being scrutinized at higher and highest levels of organizations these days.","So, even if the budget is already in place, there is often times additional approvals, in many times at the board level, even with those large, very large organizations, because these are so impactful and they are such important strategic decisions that there is often times a lot of different departments working on these and that\u2019s where it comes into play. The fact that we have a dedicated leasing team that\u2019s focused on working with the enterprises, working with the IT departments, and the treasury CFO office that puts us in such a good position to win these types of large important deals, because we have made the big investment and we have made the big investment on our engineering and design teams, because this is very much a solution sale, consultative sale. So, our investment in our professional staff and infrastructure positions us really well to meet this \u2013 what we see as a growing funnel of potential demand from the enterprises and especially its financial institutions.","Paul Morgan","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mike Foust for closing remarks.","Michael Foust \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Thank you everyone and thank you for your time and attention today. And I just want to reiterate the confidence and \u2013 that we have as a management team and the good continued secular growth in our markets and demand for our data center product and I want to thank our team members for another job well done in a very good quarter in the second quarter of this year.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Digital Realty 2011 fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pamela Garibaldi, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Marketing. Ms. Garibaldi, you may begin your conference.","Pamela M. Garibaldi","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the Digital Realty earnings press release. If you have not, you can access one in the 'Investors' section of our website at www.digitalrealty.com, or you may call 415-738-6500 to request a copy.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the management of Digital Realty may make forward-looking statements on this call that are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from expectations.

Following management's remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Questions will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael F. Foust","Thank you, Pamela and welcome to the call everyone. Before we get start with our formal remarks, I would like to thank everyone who participated in our Investor Day a few weeks ago. We greatly appreciate the positive feedback we received, and we are glad you found the information useful. Now I'll proceed with the call. I will begin with my remarks and then turn the call over to Bill who will review our exceptional fourth quarter and full-year 2011 financial results.","As we previously announced, 2011 was a record setting year for DLR. We signed new leases for approximately 1.3 million square feet, representing over $136.6 million of annual GAAP rental revenue, which represents a 22% increase over 2010. We were able to achieve these results by leveraging our global platform and expanding relationships with several multinational customers in markets ranging from Amsterdam to Dallas and Silicon Valley to Singapore.","We also achieved excellent results serving the local customer base in markets such as Paris, Los Angeles, and Melbourne, Australia. We believe that the strength of our leasing program lies in our geographically diverse portfolio, supported by local experts who deliver service and solutions to customers with a consistent commitment to excellence regardless of location. At the same time, our global portfolio enables us to provide data center solutions where our customers need them while mitigating our exposure in any one geographic market.","Heading into 2012, we have a healthy backlog of signed leases totaling approximately $84 million of annual GAAP revenue, of which $62 million will commence in 2012 and the bulk of the remaining backlog in 2013. The increase in our build-to-suit activity in 2011 certainly helped to contribute to this strong backlog. Lease terms continue to trend on the longer side. Leases signed in the fourth quarter for data center space averaged 152 months or 12.7 years, up from 110 months in the third quarter.","We also had good renewal activity in the fourth quarter, rolling over approximately 413,000 square feet of space or a 5.6% increase in GAAP rents. The renewals included approximately 90,000 square feet of turnkey space, which increased 2.2% on a GAAP basis, and approximately 290,000 square feet of Powered Base Building, which increased 15.3% on a GAAP basis. Overall, tenant retention remained very high. On a square foot basis, 100% of expiring turnkey space renewed during the fourth quarter.","On a revenue basis, turnkey leases renewed at approximately 102% of GAAP, with an average lease term of over 135 months. Again, on a square foot basis, 99% of expiring Powered Base Building leases were renewed in the quarter at 114% of GAAP rents, with an average lease term of 82 months. Portfolio occupancy increased to 94.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 93.7% in the third quarter, reflecting new leasing activity and our high renewal rate.","Same-store occupancy also increased to 95.3% from 94.2% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter same-store NOI increased to $136.7 million, up 3% from $132.6 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, was up to $124.1 million in the fourth quarter, up 3.8% from $119.6 million in the third quarter.","As we discussed at our Investor Day, we see active demand from new data center space virtually across all of our markets. We are currently tracking over 2 million square feet of demand, which is consistent with what we reported on our last call. This compares to 1.4 million square feet of identified requirements at year-end 2010, so we're certainly seeing an uptick in overall customer requirements that we've identified.","For the benefit of those who were unable to participate in our Investor Day last month, I'll briefly run through the supply and demand statistics we're tracking in a few of our major markets. As you know, our strategy is to maintain a disciplined approach to managing inventory market by market by utilizing our flexible POD architecture that's designed to deliver data center space in approximately 1-megawatt increments.","This enables us to meet customers' just-in-time requirements across our global portfolio while limiting our financial exposure in any one market. Year-over-year, lease rates in our major markets remained relatively flat. Although we've seen increased supply in Silicon Valley, Northern Virginia, and New York\/New Jersey, we continue to have strong demand for product and we've been able to maintain rents in line with our historical rates while achieving our unlevered cash return on invested capital on our new developments of between 11% and 14%.","In New York Metro, including New Jersey, we're tracking nearly 31 megawatts of potential demand. We believe the increase in demand over previous quarters reflects pent-up demand from financial services as well as system integrators and managed services cloud providers that support the financial vertical. This compares with approximately 23 megawatts of available supply that is either built out or currently under construction.","At DLR, our New York Metro exposure is relatively small at present. We currently have three TKD PODs or about 3.5 megawatts available. We believe that DLR represents about 60% of the 17.6 megawatts of supply that was absorbed in 2011. In Northern Virginia, we're tracking approximately 18.5 megawatts of current demand. This compares to approximately 29.5 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or under construction.","Again, we have a very manageable current exposure in this market with 2 megawatts of available built-out supply in the DLR portfolio. We estimate that DLR represents approximately 49% of the 43.3 megawatts of supply absorbed in Northern Virginia in 2011. Dallas has continued to be a very active market for us, with very limited available built-out supply. We've identified approximately 24.5 megawatts of demand compared to 7.2 megawatts of net new built-out supply.","During the quarter, we signed leases with separate customers at two buildings that are under construction currently at our Datacenter Park Dallas property. That's in Richardson, Texas. The first lease is for a 112,000 square foot build-to-suit, and the second is for 42,000 square feet. As a result, we're moving ahead with the construction of two new buildings in the park in addition to the two that we've leased. In the Dallas market, we estimate that digital lease signings represented approximately 62% of the 2011 absorption.","And finally, in Silicon Valley, we're currently tracking about 3.6 megawatts of demand compared to about 24 megawatts of currently available supply. As we discussed at our Investor Day, with more than eight years of experience leasing in Silicon Valley, we recognize that it has rather unique demand characteristics. Internet based companies have traditionally been major consumers of data center space in the Valley. Their growth and subsequent data center requirements are extremely difficult to predict, even for the enterprises themselves, which are growing so quickly.","While there appears to be a significant supply surplus today, new requirements can and will emerge and absorb supply quickly. Our exposure at present is a very manageable just 4 megawatts of available supply either currently or that we currently have under construction. We estimate DLR represented approximately 19% of the over 36 megawatts of absorption in Silicon Valley in 2011. In addition, we're seeing strong demand in markets such as Phoenix and Boston, where we're generating significant leasing momentum.","Let me turn to our acquisitions program. We acquired four properties during the quarter for a total purchase price of $157 million, bringing total acquisitions for the year to $246 million. Fourth quarter activity included the Dublin development site we discussed on our last call as well as two income-producing properties, one in San Francisco, CBD, and one in Atlanta.","In addition, we acquired a development side in Northern Virginia that was subsequently contributed to a joint venture partnership with an existing customer for another build-to-suit project. As soon as we receive customer approval, we plan to provide additional information on this transaction in the coming weeks. We continue to take a prudent approach to expanding our European portfolio, which currently represents 11% or $91 million of total annualized rent in the portfolio.","As of December 31, 2011, the stabilized portfolio was 92% leased in Europe. In Asia-Pac, we've signed leases for 40% of our building in Singapore, and this is more than 18 months ahead of our underwriting assumptions, so we're seeing very good activity in the Singapore market. We're currently tracking over 51 megawatts of potential demand, as we continue construction on the remaining 11 megawatts of available IT capacity at that building.","In Melbourne, we held a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the start of construction on a 50,000 square foot facility fully leased to National Australia Bank, NAB. We have additional expansion capacity at this location, and we're currently tracking about 4 megawatts of demand. Construction is also underway at our Sydney site. We're building a 90,000 square foot facility designed to support four of our 1,440-kilowatt PODs. We expect to deliver the first two PODs in the fourth quarter of 2012.","In Sydney, we're tracking about 8 megawatts of demand. Our development program continues to be very active, supplying new facilities that will fuel our ongoing growth. During the fourth quarter, we completed over 224,000 square feet of data center space, which was 93% leased. This consisted of 36,000 square feet of turnkey that was over 56% leased, 5,000 square feet of Powered Base Building 100% leased, and over 183,000 square feet of build-to-suit space that was also 100% leased.","At quarter-end, we were under construction in turnkey space totaling about 489,000 square feet, including 284,000 square feet in the United States, 44,000 square feet in Europe, and approximately 161,000 square feet in Singapore and Australia. Approximately 31% of this space is pre-leased. For Powered Base Building space, we're under construction on about 341,000 square feet in the U.S. In Europe, we had about 88,000 square feet under construction, which includes the new Chessington redevelopment property in London that we acquired in the third quarter.","So we've started building on that straightaway. Lastly, we had approximately 275,000 square feet of build-to-suit space under construction in the U.S., which is 100% pre-leased. Including pre-construction work and common area building improvements, the total construction work in progress at the quarter was $221 million. The estimated cost to complete the ongoing December 31 work in progress is $486 million.","So this concludes my prepared remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein. Bill?","A. William Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. I will keep my remarks quite brief and will focus primarily on fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results that were not addressed on our Investor Day.","As Mike mentioned, 2011 was another year of exceptional performance by Digital. On Tuesday, our Board approved a quarterly common stock dividend increase of 7.4% or $0.05 a share to $0.73 per share. This is our tenth dividend increase in a little over seven years since our 2004 IPO. Since our first full quarter of operations, we've grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 17%.","This increase reflects our optimism for continued growth, the need to meet REIT distribution requirements, and is consistent with our existing policy to distribute 100% of taxable income to minimize corporate level federal income taxes. As we disclosed in our Investor Day presentation, we raised $2.8 billion in capital during the year from a variety of sources to fund the growth of our company, which includes our $1.5 billion global revolving credit facility that closed during the fourth quarter.","This substantial increase in borrowing capacity will accommodate our growing global investment program and provide immediate liquidity for potential acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, we generated $42.4 million of net proceeds from our At-the-Market equity distribution program from the issuance of 668,000 shares at an average price of $64.08, bringing the total for the year to $456.8 million of net proceeds under the current and previous programs at an average share price of $59.68.","Since January 2012, we have issued approximately $63 million of common stock at an average price of $66.19 per share. We have $53.8 million remaining under the current program. We have $1.1 billion of immediate liquidity, including $26.6 million in short-term investments, plus the funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, our Prudential shelf facility, and other secured debt.","After the payoff of two European secured loans in January for $73.4 million and assuming extension options are exercised, in 2012 we have $68 million remaining principal amortization and debt maturities, including $53 million for a secured loan maturing in October. In 2013, we have $260 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. All per-share results are on a diluted share and unit basis.","As stated in today's earnings release, the fourth quarter FFO per share was $1.02. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, fourth quarter 2011 core FFO was $600,000 higher than reported FFO or $1.03 per share. This reflects a 7.3% increase from the fourth quarter 2010 FFO of $0.96 per share. For the full year 2011, FFO per share was $4.06, up nearly 20% from 2010 FFO per share of $3.39.","When adjusting for non-core items, 2011 FFO per share was $4.09, up over 17% from 2010 core FFO of $3.49. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $94.9 million, up from $92.5 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 81.9%, up slightly from 81% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.3% or 6% quarter-over-quarter, which improved our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.4 times in the fourth quarter, down from 4.5 times last quarter.","Our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.2 times at year end 2011 compared to 3.4 times in the previous quarter. This decrease is due to the issuance of our 7% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock in third quarter of 2011. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $622.9 million in 2011, up nearly 22% year-over-year from $512.1 million in 2010. As disclosed in our Investor Day presentation, at the midpoint of our 2012 guidance, we forecast 18% growth in 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $733 million versus 2011 adjusted EBITDA of $623 million.","Turning to the income statement, net operating income increased by $6.8 million to $173.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $166.3 million last quarter. This increase is primarily attributed to growth provided by incremental leasing, lower net utilities in the quarter and a favorable property tax adjustment that resulted from a final tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to tenants.","Although total reimbursements of $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased from $56.7 million in the third quarter, the operating margin for the overall portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2011 is higher at 65%, compared to 63.1% in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting lower OpEx in the fourth quarter. G&A decreased by 14.4% to $12.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $14.6 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to year-end accrual adjustments.","Interest and other income decreased to $398,000 in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.2 million in the last quarter, primarily due to third quarter 2011 foreign exchange transaction gains. Finally, we are maintaining our 2012 FFO guidance range of $4.34 to $4.48 per share that we announced on January 30, 2012, with the same assumptions that were set forth in that press release.","That concludes our formal remarks. We can now open the call to your questions, Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thanks and good morning out there. I just wanted to follow up on markets and market rents specifically. I know that you guys do a nice job of providing some demand and supply statistics. I'm just curious. And I know you have a lot of different -- you have a broad product array and a broad number of markets now. But if you could maybe just generically talk about what you're seeing in market rents across your different product types?","Michael F. Foust","","Well, rents --","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Oh, go ahead.","Michael F. Foust","","Oh no, I'm good. Go ahead, Jordan.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","That's the question. And then as a follow-up, I was just curious if you could maybe talk about any large tenant requirements you were seeing in the market.","Michael F. Foust","","Sure. By and large, for the leases we've been executing on, we were looking at the last five or six quarters in some of these markets where there is some growing supply like in Silicon Valley, in Virginia, and New Jersey. And our lease rates have been remarkably flat and really not declining on what we've been executing on. I would say probably, generally, in Silicon Valley, rents might be down 10% to 15% in some cases.","But depending on the requirement, the level of resiliency in the facility, we've been pretty flat. Now we haven't had a lot of product to lease in Silicon Valley. We'll be bringing on a couple more PODs in a couple of months because we always want to have some product even in markets that are a little more frothy. But I think by and large, our lease rates are holding well in some of these markets.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Is that in the U.S., or is that everywhere?","Michael F. Foust","","Now in other markets, we've seen maybe prices, the rates tick up a bit in places like Dallas and Phoenix. Certainly internationally, in Australia and Singapore, pricing is very good for us and we're looking at healthy returns in those markets. But across the board in the U.S. markets, we're still on our spec buildings achieving 11% -- 14% unlevered return on costs. So that continues to be very consistent for us.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thanks. And just the follow-up on the large tenant requirements, are you seeing large tenants in any of these markets? I know you don't have a tremendous amount of availability, but I was curious in terms of what you're seeing out there for demand there.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes, it's interesting. In New Jersey, we're seeing some very large requirements from major Wall Street firms. And those will be ones that we can accommodate either in our Powered Base Building product that we have built out in Piscataway. We have space in Weehawken as well, a little bit less, smaller space in Weehawken, a couple PODs there and we've got a combination of build-to-suit requirements in Somerset and other sites that we have that we've identified.","And we're seeing a couple of very large requirements potentially in London, certainly in Dallas, a number of good medium-size requirements for Phoenix, Boston. So across the board, it's pretty active. What's interesting, especially interesting are the large requirements that are percolating out there, some maybe in early stages for the New Jersey area.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Paul B. Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC","","Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit in terms of your visibility about the ramp in development spend over the course of the year relative to your full-year guidance? And then just in terms of plans for funding, how comfortable are you with growing the volume of equity issue to the ATM versus other forms of capital raise?","A. William Stein","Paul, I can speak to the funding piece of it. The good news is we're coming into the year with a relatively low leverage. We're at 4.4 debt-to-EBITDA. We'd like to manage it up to five, higher if need be. So given the growth of EBITDA, there's clearly plenty of room for additional leverage, and our needs for equity are relatively modest. So given the modest needs for equity, I'm very comfortable that we can fund through the ATM.","And one of the alternatives for us, which we demonstrated in August of last year, is that we're willing to go to the perpetual preferred market as well. And those rates, if anything, are more attractive today than they were when we issued in August. So we view that as extraordinarily attractive permanent capital.","Michael F. Foust","","And then in terms of the ramp, I think we're fairly steady now. I don't have a schedule in front of me that breaks it out by quarter, but I think we're relatively steady quarter-by-quarter at this point with the amount of activity that we have underway.","Paul B. Morgan \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC","","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thank you. Bill, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the year-over-year change in operating expenses in the same-store portfolio and walk us through the different line items and your expectation for this year.","A. William Stein","I've got the Q4 to Q3 comparison for same-store margins here and let's -- I'll pull up the same-store from the sub.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And also versus 4Q last year, it seems like there were some pretty big spikes.","A. William Stein","The operating margins in Q4 versus Q3 improved about 150 basis points, so 67.3% Q4 versus 65.8% Q3.","Michael F. Foust","","And I think you'll probably see a similar uptick in margins compared to the fourth quarter of last year as well. And I think one of the things you have to remember is on fourth quarters there are a lot of reconciliations going on. And when you look at annualized year-over-year, our margins are holding or improving.","A. William Stein","The other that will happen and which has happened during this period is that we've brought online quite a bit of turnkey data center space, which has the effect of increasing the operating expenses quite a bit when it comes on. And to the extent that it's vacant, there's no revenue, obviously, so there may be some of that going on versus the fourth quarter of 2010.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So if you look, I'm just looking at the supplemental feed. It shows 40 basis points of year-over-year occupancy growth. Do you think some of that space last year was dormant even though it was leased?","A. William Stein","","Yes.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And then you've got utilities are showing 12% growth. Your other maintenance and operating is showing 20% growth. Taxes is 24%. What would drive such a big increase on each of those lines?","A. William Stein","In taxes or in the whole thing?","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","No, like those are three of the ones that really stick out. Do you think all that space --","Michael F. Foust","","Your portfolio is growing quite a bit year-over-year. And once again, really what's more meaningful is looking at the entire year of 2010 with the entire year of 2011 gives you a better idea because the operating margins are actually improving and there are just a lot of reconciliations that go on the fourth quarter. So fourth quarters are hard to -- it's hard to extrapolate from a fourth quarter alone.","A. William Stein","Yeah, I think you need to ignore the utilities because the utilities are increasing 11.8% but the reimbursements are increasing 14.4%.","Michael F. Foust","","Yeah, we've actually added quarter-over-quarter,12\/31\/2010 to 12\/31\/2011, we've added over 770,000 square feet of occupied square feet and the great majority of that is turnkey data centers that are gross rents -- I'm sorry. It's actually over 1 million.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Michael F. Foust","","It's actually over -- I'm sorry. It's over 1 million square feet, 1.2 million square feet we added.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Is that considered same-store even though you add square footage?","Michael F. Foust","","A lot of that's in the same -- in operating buildings, yeah, not all of that. And I don't know exactly the proportion, but a lot of that is in current operating buildings, yes.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, I guess it will be useful to know what was utilized square feet year-over-year also in this presentation.","Michael F. Foust","","If you look at our EBITDA margins year-in, year-out on an annual basis, we're going to be on an EBITDA margin basis 60% or a little better very steadily.","A. William Stein","And the NOI margin of the rents 75%.","Michael F. Foust","","Right.","James C. Feldman \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, I appreciate it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Hey, guys. It's Manny Korchman here with Michael. Just looking into 2012 and your acquisition guidance, can you help us think about how those might flow in? I think at your Investor Day, you had talked about a big acquisition happening in 1Q. Is that still on pace?","A. William Stein","That's still on pace. And I think for purposes of -- with the exception of that acquisition, when that acquisition happens, you'll see how much it is. Subtract it from our guidance and then I would assume mid-quarter convention for the balance.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes, it may be a little back-ended because that seems to be the way that real estate transactions occur. There seem to be more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, but that's probably as good a convention as any.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Just for modeling purposes at this point, is that half of what you're talking about? Is it three-quarters, or can you give us some idea of magnitude?","A. William Stein","Of the first quarter?","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Of the 1Q, yes.","A. William Stein","It's roughly one-third at the low end.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Okay. And then so going back to, I guess, Mike's comment, a pretty slow 2Q and then a pickup in 3Q and 4Q?","A. William Stein","That would be safe. These acquisitions --","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Okay.","A. William Stein","To the extent they come in later in the year, really don't move the needle that much for the current year FFO. It's more of a subsequent year FFO item.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","","Yes, perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach from ISI Group. Your line is open.","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Great, thanks. Bill, just I guess to follow up on Jamie's question, maybe asked a different way, the non-utility OpEx jumped by about $5 million in the fourth quarter. So should we expect that to go back to a $25 million or so run rate going forward?","A. William Stein","Let me see.","Michael F. Foust","","Once again, we're adding properties because we're doing a lot of construction and, hopefully, a lot of leasing along with it. And we have a good backlog, as I mentioned earlier, that will be coming online, and a lot of that's in those same-store buildings. But I think we're going to -- on a percentage basis, we ought to be pretty steady.","A. William Stein","I think it should be flat, flatter.","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Flat with the $30 million going forward?","A. William Stein","Flat to the $30 million.","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Okay. And I guess on the rental rate side, the gap spreads on the turnkey leasing were about 2% positive this quarter. But can you help us understand what the cash roll-down was? I'm assuming it was negative.","Michael F. Foust","","Is this on the renewal activity?","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Yes.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes. So on renewals, we had two transactions with two very large, very long-term customers that renewed in the quarter. And we did have a roll-down somewhat in the cash based on those two. And both of these were long-term leases; one was 10 years and one was 13 years. And they had both been going up, one like 4% a year, one 3% a year and they renewed. Each one renewed for like another 10 to 12 years each.","So when you get that compounding, sometimes you get an occurrence where that rent has gotten so high at the end of 12 years that when you're resetting to have a reasonable lease rate, especially for big customers of ours, we're willing to be flexible so that the overall rent going forward on a straight-line basis is a significant uptick for us.","But they get a little bit of relief at the front end, so the cash goes down 2% or 10% or 12% in one case where it was a PBB lease. But on an overall basis, it went down 12% on this Powered Base Building, but on an average, it's going to be up almost 17%. And we're not talking about -- we're talking about rents in the $20s, $20 per square foot per year.","So, all-in-all, it's actually a net increase in value for the buildings because we're renewing these big tenants at higher average rents for a 10 to 12 year basis. And if you took those two out, then the cash uptick would be 4% for turnkey and 3% for Powered Base Building if you take those two out on a cash basis.","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just finally, Bill or Mike, what should we expect in terms of land acquisitions this year? And can you just remind us on that million or so square feet of re-dev space that aren't under construction, are you capitalizing any costs on those land or they all sort of a drag to FFO?","Michael F. Foust","","Well, land, you can't capitalize land under any circumstance. So our land holdings are really -- we're really in good shape in terms of kind of feeding demand, so our significant land holdings would be our next phase in Virginia, the smaller piece that we acquired in Dublin. We have land for development at our Richardson Datacenter Park, Dallas.","So those three locations are probably where we have actual land. And then where we have re-development space, shelf space in the re-dev portfolio, if it's not under construction, we are not capitalizing. But the acquisition that should close this quarter has some land that we'll be able to use at a later date; about 10 acres and a lot of power.","George D. Auerbach \u2013 ISI Group, Inc.","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Going back to Jamie's question on G&A, the $12.5 million of G&A this quarter, how much of accruals were actually in? And if you were to take that out, what would be the normalized run rate?","A. William Stein","Well, I think what we should do is look at the guidance for 2012.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","I think it's the reconciliation I was just trying to do basically, figuring out if that guidance actually does make sense.","A. William Stein","Well, $14 million is sort of a normal.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes. And, Tayo, if you look at -- especially if you look at G&A as percentage of revenues, we're very steady there. So if you look at the G&A and our guidance on G&A, it's very much in line with the previous years and even ticked down a snitch, but we're very consistent as G&A as a percentage of revenues, which I think is a meaningful number, meaningful ratio if you look at how we're managing our business.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Okay, that's helpful. Bill, second question goes to you. As I look at your credit metrics, they're just really, really strong at this point. Just kind of curious what you think your chances are in regards to getting yet another credit rating upgrade.","A. William Stein","It's awfully hard to anticipate the rating agencies' actions. I think clearly, we maintain a very strong balance sheet. I think one of the criteria that the agencies rely upon is knowing how long a company has been operating as a public company, but how long it's been operating as a rated entity. And in our case, I think it's been a couple of years now.","But the agencies publish their criteria for the ratings of these various -- and what the criteria needs to be on per-credit metrics. And I think that certainly you could make the argument that we should be a BBB plus or a Baa, one. And in fact, we do make that argument every time we see them. But clearly, to-date, we've not been successful in winning that argument. But that's not to say we won't try it the next time we see them.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Okay, makes sense. And then just last question in regards to any markets that you're not in right now where you do feel those markets are attractive and you could take a look at, a strong to look at?","Michael F. Foust","","Certainly, we like the Hong Kong market a lot and we'd like to be there and we're working on being there. We're hopeful that we're going to be participating in that market before the end of the year. That's probably the main one. Frankfurt's an interesting market as well that we're not in. I'd say those are probably the two main larger markets that have a lot of appeal.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Nothing domestically?","Michael F. Foust","","We're in so many markets now. Now, that's not to say on a build-to-suit basis, we wouldn't expand into some new markets, but yes, the latest one being with our build-to-suit operation with NetApp in suburban Portland, in Hillsboro, Portland, that's kind of an interesting market, so that -- but if you look around, we're in Seattle meaningfully, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, LA, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago.","You'll probably see us doing more in Chicago. We like that market a lot and we're virtually 96% leased there. We'll be doing more in Boston, expanding our footprint in the Boston market and expanding in our Needham facility and continue to expand the operations in Wakefield. Virginia, we continue to be very active, as we are in New Jersey.","And I could see us perhaps -- we made a nice acquisition of income, stabilized property at Linton, and that's a market we'll look at potentially doing more in. But I think we've got the U.S. pretty covered from a major market per spec building, but that's not to say on a build-to-suit basis we wouldn't go to new markets in the U.S.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","","Great, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Hi, everyone. I just wanted to clarify something, I'm not sure if I have missed it but it sounds like you're ready to move forward with some work in the Silicon Valley, even though there's somewhat of a supply -- over supply situation there today currently based on the quirkiness. In New Jersey, are you guys ready to move forward on new stuff there? It seems like your commentary in terms of the supply demand has been more positive than I think a lot of people looking at that market would think, and I just wanted to get your thoughts there.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes, certainly. In New Jersey, I think we have three PODs available right now, about 3.5 megawatts that's built out, ready to go, but we also have hard-based building, probably a couple of 100,000 feet that we have available that we can build out custom or build out more or leases as Power Base Building. The folks want to use their own capital to build out.","And we are talking to customers about doing more customized build-to-suit within those buildings if you will. And we continue to look at new sites to accommodate some of these larger requirements that are out to there that are more build-to-suit-oriented. So we're definitely very busy in New Jersey right now.","A. William Stein","And Vincent, we think that New Jersey is more so than other markets, a market where demand is characterized by corporate enterprise as opposed to Internet. And we believe that we've demonstrated that our product is well suited to the corporate enterprise market. And so, to the extent that you might hear from others that demand is not looking as strong in New Jersey that might be a function of whether their product meets the corporate enterprise market as well as ours does.","Michael F. Foust","","Just this week, we became aware of maybe another 20 megawatts of potential projects from major firms. So there's a lot going on potentially in New Jersey.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. I guess I'm just trying to understand for the minute, it does sound like there's some activity there and your product if it fits better, why not go ahead more aggressively with spec. Your commentary just now just seems more oriented towards build-to-suit type of stuff, which obviously carries a little bit lower risk. But if there's already a demand, under supply of space for the type of space that's needed, why not go ahead with more spec?","Michael F. Foust","","We can build that very quickly in our existing Powered Base Buildings. So in Somerset, in Piscataway, and Weehawken, in all those places we have Powered Base building -- in the case of Weehawken, it's actually built out beyond Powered Base. We have one POD and one POD that is about halfway built out. In Piscataway and Somerset right now, we have space that we can build out very quickly, customized space.","So instead of building out the spec POD, if we can deliver something in 12 or 14 weeks for a customer and we could do it on a more customized basis, it's definitely for everyone's benefit to do that. And we have the just-in-time product available for those who do want to move in, in 30 days. So we have the best of both worlds there.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is open.","William A. Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Hey, good morning, guys, a quick question here for you. You clearly have the capacity to be an industry consolidator. What are you seeing on the private side from a potential acquisition perspective? And I'm not talking not just one-offs, but larger transactions. We've seen CyrusOne being mentioned as potentially coming public or being spun off. Anything you can comment on there that could give us a roadmap to where you guys may end up?","Michael F. Foust","","The opportunities that we're seeing right now that we think are executable are individual property acquisitions. And we're really not seeing other than speculation other M&A opportunities, though we always have our feelers out and we're always inquiring with companies about the potential for larger, more enterprise M&A type investments. But I really can't say that there's anything percolating at this point.","William A. Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Okay.","A. William Stein","If the right opportunity came along, we'd be clearly interested.","William A. Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Okay.","A. William Stein","And we have the balance sheet today to acquire just about anything.","Michael F. Foust","","Yes. We're very, very open to the ideas.","William A. Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","And then one final question, hopefully on New Jersey, which is you talked about pent-up demand from financial services tenants. Is there any concrete evidence now that they're out in the market more aggressively? Are tours increasing, or have you actually seen some deals signed, or is this just still on the come?","Michael F. Foust","","The demand that we're talking about and that we put in our stats are projects that we're bidding on or that we have at least preliminary proposals out to or proposed LOIs at least. And then there are some very large potential build-to-suits that are out in the market with RFPs and RFIs currently.","William A. Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Thank you. That's it for me.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Lukas Hartwich \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","","Thank you. Hey, guys. Mike, I was hoping you could talk about how you think about the relative risks and rewards when you're weighing whether to deploy capital domestically or internationally.","Michael F. Foust","","It's interesting because the markets that we're looking at, where we're actively building, both the U.S. and internationally, are major markets. So whether it's London or Dallas or Singapore or Northern Virginia, we're not taking emerging market risk at all. So the initial risk that we think we mitigate very well with our processes and procedures is going into a new market, whether it's a new market domestically or a new market internationally.","And we mitigate those risks because we have tried and true very specific programs on design, contracting, project management, commissioning, and property operations. And when we go into a new market, whether it's in the U.S. or in international, we have market leaders come in from other Digital regions to get things set up, trained, establish our program while we're training local folks. And a lot of our employees are international folks too who have a lot of experience.","So there, for example, our folks in Australia and Singapore, our long-time data center experts and operators in those markets. So it's more of entering a new market rather than an international market because we're not going into emerging markets. We're staying in mature, where are a lot of our customers, frankly, especially a place like Singapore and London and even Paris are existing customers of ours and working with us in multiple markets, the same for Amsterdam as well.","Lukas Hartwich \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","","That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Your line is open.","Gabriel Hilmoe \u2013 UBS Securities, LLC","","Hey, guys. It's Gabe Hilmoe here with Ross. I was wondering. Can you maybe talk a little bit about Equinix evaluating the possibility of converting some or all of their business to a REIT and how you maybe view that relationship going forward from a potential competitive standpoint?","Michael F. Foust","","We're really good partners and we're doing work together all the time and new things all the time, including currently. So with our relationships and in terms of value that we bring, in being able to play in so many markets, it has been very value-add for them. We've got great relationships top to bottom throughout the organization. So we expect to continue to have a great relationship with them.","Gabriel Hilmoe \u2013 UBS Securities, LLC","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore Partners. Your line is open. Jonathan Schildkraut, your line is open.","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Hello?","Michael F. Foust","","Yes, we can.","A. William Stein","Now we can.","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","All right, I apologize for that. I had a question about New Jersey. Bill, you talked about tracking a lot of demand and demand from financial services, and we're tracking actually a bunch of demand from financial services as well. And one of the things that we are hearing is that some of these clients are very interested in dedicated backup systems, generators, and other equipment.","And you noted that perhaps your facilities were better suited to fill some of the demand in the New Jersey market. I was wondering if you could tell us if that was one of the items that you were seeing. And if not, maybe you could elucidate us a little bit on what it is about your facilities that places you in a better competitive position. Thanks.","Michael F. Foust","","Sure. Mike here. I'll go ahead and answer that. Yes, definitely, our POD architecture, where we have dedicated power and UPS backup power infrastructure, is critical, especially for financial services, but really for almost all corporate enterprises. They really don't want to be in a position where they're sharing the power systems and parts of the cooling systems with other customers.","So our buildings are designed essentially to be buildings within a building, so that power and backup power infrastructure is fully dedicated to the individual customer. And that really is a primary criteria for your financial services and corporate enterprise in general.","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","All right, excellent. If I could sneak one more, it's more of a mathematical question, but we were calculate churn. And it looks like churn, at least for 2011, is falling somewhere or fell somewhere in the 7% on an annual basis range. Is that in the range of a correct number?","A. William Stein","I don't believe. If you look at our renewal overall, our overall renewals on a revenue basis, GAAP revenue basis, I think we're probably about 100%.","Michael F. Foust","","Are you looking at square footage?","Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners, Inc.","","No. I was just trying to look at the revenue run rates, incremental lease commencements and then realized incremental revenue growth. You know what; I can take that question offline. I apologize.","Michael F. Foust","","Okay, no worries.","Operator","","And your last question comes from the line of Chris Lucas from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Good morning, guys, just a couple of quick questions. Just going back to New Jersey real quick, Mike, just so I'm clear, latency is not an issue for a lot of these users at this point. Really it is more of a back-office functional demand issue in New Jersey for those corporate users?","Michael F. Foust","","It varies. It varies widely. Yes, I'd say it's a range. There's still a significant amount of latency sensitive. Even if it's not necessarily trading, there are databases that need to be concurrently maintainable. And then there are a number of -- a significant amount of applications that are less latency critical, some of the more cloud-oriented, grid-computing types.","And some of those actually applications we've taken with Wall Street firms down in Virginia and some other locations that maybe they can enjoy a little bit lower power cost especially. So it really runs the gamut. We're seeing a lot of consolidation, and we've been seeing this across the board now for a couple years and it's starting to accelerate where companies in general will have data centers in different departments.","It's in the converted broom closets, the converted conference rooms, in high-rise buildings. And the IT departments are getting their arms around all these dispersed applications in different departments and bringing them under one roof. And that typically means coming into a new facility that's built for them. So I think we're seeing a lot of that. That does represent a pretty wide range of applications and equipment.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Okay, and then just talking about consolidation. There is money in the federal budget for data center consolidation. I guess I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in terms of actual movement along that front and then also sort of what your sense is to the ultimate size of that opportunity.","Michael F. Foust","","We're clearly seeing more activity and more interest in leasing as opposed to owning with the government. We think it's going to be a trend. We speculate it's going to be a trend. It's a little too early to tell, especially in election year, but we are starting to see some requirements and we've actually executed on government requirements recently in Virginia that represent that kind of consolidation into the new facility.","So I'm guessing we'll continue to see that and maybe start to build through this year. So we're encouraged that there's going to be more government demand, especially as looking more at operating model versus an owning model.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Okay. And then last question, Bill, just on -- relative to guidance. There's been a little deterioration in the dollar relative to some of the other currencies. I just wanted to get a sense as to how much variance off of the guidance dollar to the other currency denominations do you need to see in order to have a meaningful impact on sort of the outcome of the results for 2012?","A. William Stein","Right now, our guidance or assumptions for currency exchange rates for guidance purposes are conservative, in the sense that I think the euro and the pound and the Sing dollar are all quite a bit higher -- not quite a bit, but higher than what we stated in our assumptions. So, at this point, if today's exchange rates for the balance of the year and there were no fluctuation whatsoever, it would add another couple of pennies to the existing FFO.","Chris R. Lucas \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Great, thanks a lot. That was helpful.","A. William Stein","It actually goes the other way.","Operator","","And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Mike Foust for any closing remarks.","Michael F. Foust","","Once again, thank you everyone for taking the time to be with us today and taking the time for a great turnout for the Investor Day as well. And I'd just like to thank all of our team members here at Digital Realty. Our team has done a terrific job, record-breaking year in leasing and developing our customer relationships more deeply. And the team here is doing a terrific job delivering those data center solutions across a wide range of market.","So my thanks to the DLR team and we're looking forward to a really good 2012. Thank you.","Operator","","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7241":["Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Stewart","Thank you, Andrea.","The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our second quarter results. First and foremost, consistent execution against our customer success initiatives drove all-time high new logos, our second highest interconnection and renewal leasing and our third highest total bookings.","Second, we leveraged our global platform to prudently allocate capital, where we were able to achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world, creating significant value for shareholders. Third, we extended our sustainability leadership with the publication of our inaugural ESG report, an official recognition as an ENERGY STAR partner.","Last but not least, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to execute an opportunistic $900 million liability management trade, clearing our runway out to 2022 and extending our weighted average duration by nearly half the year while ratcheting our weighted average coupon down by 10 basis points.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","William Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.","The durability of Digital Realty's global platform was on full display in the second quarter of 2019. And our team was incredibly productive over the past 90 days. We delivered the third highest bookings in the Company's history. Demonstrating the strength of our globally diversified portfolio, we also signed the second highest volume of interconnection bookings as well as renewal leasing and we expanded our colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion.","We also landed an all-time high number of new logos this quarter, an encouraging indication, our efforts to penetrate enterprise demand are bearing fruit and a promising sign for future interconnection revenue growth prospects.","Along those lines, I'm pleased to announce that we will be hosting MarketplaceLIVE at Spring Studios in New York on November 7, a daylong event connecting the community that builds the cloud network and Internet infrastructure. The event attracts a broad swath across the tech ecosystem and we are expecting over 600 attendees from network engineers and start-ups to solution architects and cloud service providers to CIOs at Fortune 500 companies.","We further extended our global platform during the second quarter and we took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions shown here on Page 3 of our presentation. We closed on three smaller strategic land parcels in Northern Virginia to further physically connect our market leading campus footprint. We also re-entered Paris with new capacity based on significant verified customer demand.","And earlier this afternoon, we announced that we are under contract to acquire a parcel in Frankfurt, building upon the success of our sales in the second quarter as well as the recent investment and our coverage of Western Europe. We closed on a land parcel in Tokyo through our MC Digital Realty Japan partnership.","Finally, we also announced early this afternoon, we are entering South Korea with plans to develop a carrier-neutral facility in the Sangam Digital Media City in northwest Seoul. We announced the grand openings of an expansion in Dublin in May, the second phase of our Osaka connected campus in June and most recently, we announced that our Latin America platform, Ascenty opened four fully leased facilities in Sao Paulo during the second quarter.","We continue to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and we were officially named an ENERGY STAR partner. We continue to invest in our human capital with several key hires.","We achieved the Amazon Web Services - service delivery designation for AWS Direct Connect. And last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet locking in our lowest ever 10-year U.S. dollar bond coupon, and opportunistically terming up our 2020 and 2021 maturities.","Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 4. Following the record absorption in 2018, the primary data center metros in North America have been relatively quiet in 2019, especially given the tough year-over-year comparison in Northern Virginia, which is not only the largest data center market in the world, but it's also the most competitive with the broadest selection of existing competitors and the deepest pool of new entrants trying to stake a claim.","Loudoun County is ground zero and Ashburn is the most desirable submarket. Even for prime locations, however, the supply demand pendulum has swung away from providers in favor of customers with various new entrants bringing speculative supply online while the most voracious consumers remain in digestion mode.","We believe, we have a set of significant competitive advantages in Northern Virginia, given the scale of our footprint, the head start from selling to an installed customer base with a strong desire to grow adjacent to their existing deployments and the longest runway to support their growth.","Ultimately, we believe it's a question of when, not if hyperscale procurement cycles enter their next phase of growth and the pendulum can swing back the other direction quickly. In the meantime, we do expect the current supply-demand dynamic will lead to dislocation in the market, which we believe will create investment opportunities for disciplined, well capitalized competitors.","The New York metro area, in contrast, has seen a recent resurgence in demand and the market has gradually tightened, as excess inventory has been slowly absorbed while new deliveries have been sparse.","In Dallas, there are number of competitors with available supply, but we continue to enjoy good success in Dallas, particularly on our Richardson campus where existing customers consistently expand with us despite the availability of competitive supply elsewhere in the Metroplex. Recent developments in Chicago have been particularly encouraging.","The State of Illinois recently passed legislation, creating data center tax incentives that put Chicago back on par with other jurisdictions that have actively encouraged data center investment. Although, we have not signed any major new leases in Chicago, since Governor Pritzker signs a bill on June 28.","We have seen an immediate uptick in customer interest. We are optimistic this bill will spur a rebound in demand. We commend Governor Pritzker and the Illinois State Legislature for their leadership in adopting this legislation as well as the Digital Realty Central region portfolio management team which worked extensively behind the scenes, along with the business and labor communities to advance this bipartisan legislation.","Supply remain scarce in Santa Clara which is arguably the tightest market in the U.S. and generally commands a pricing premium relative to most other domestic metros. During the second quarter, we saw strong demand from cloud and from enterprise in Santa Clara. Back across the pond, recent market leadership in Europe has shifted from London to Frankfurt, which has been the standout metro in 2019.","Following our success with an enterprise customer on our Frankfurt campus last quarter, we signed a major cloud service provider - brand new to our Sausenheim campus with a large and growing deployment. Although requirements in Europe remain smaller than the U.S., partly due to data sovereignty considerations they are getting bigger. The leading global cloud providers remain the primary consumers and these cloud providers continue to exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to their initial deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key.","Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern. You may have seen that Amsterdam recently placed a 12-month moratorium on data center construction. This is a developing situation and the potential impact on future projects is not entirely clear.","However, from our perspective, barriers to entry just got higher and Amsterdam incumbents such as ourselves have a competitive advantage. We believe, we are very well positioned given the network density of our interconnection hub at Amsterdam Science Park.","In-place permits on project, currently under construction at our De President campus and visibility to incremental capacity adjacent to, but not subject to either of the municipalities that have imposed the moratorium.","Across the Asia Pacific region, demand remains robust in our key markets, driven primarily by global cloud service provider requirements. We have seen notable strength in Osaka, where we landed a major Japanese integrated communication service provider as a new logo, further validating our Connected Campus strategy for the Kansai region. Similar promising pipeline supports our ongoing campus development projects in Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney.","On the supply side, market inventory remains mostly in check and we remain bullish on our prospects in the region given our first mover advantage into Osaka, barriers to entry in Tokyo, government involvement in Singapore, and rapidly growing cloud adoption in Sydney. While the IT infrastructure landscape across the Asia-Pacific region continues to mature, we see a significant runway for growth for years to come.","Finally, we continue to see a strong pipeline of demand for our platform in Latin America, specifically focused across Brazil and now Chile from leading global cloud providers along with new potential customers.","We are quite pleased with the performance to date and believe, we are poised to continue to capture an outsized share of demand in this region, characterized by significant upside from growing Internet adoption along with limited availability of institutional quality data center capacity.","On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider.","Let's turn to capital allocation on Page 5. The data center sector is maturing as an asset class and we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. This has had the natural effect of compressing returns, particularly in the U.S. This trend is somewhat of a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio. On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions.","We believe our global platform represents a competitive advantage in terms of capital allocation as well as access to capital. We have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most attractive risk-adjusted returns around the world while also tapping the broadest, lowest cost pools of capital in the countries where we operate.","In addition, we are adapting to the growing demand within the data center investment sales market by seeking to harvest capital from mature assets in the U.S. and redeploy the proceeds into higher growth opportunities elsewhere. We believe, we have a unique ability to allocate capital, where we see the most favorable risk adjusted returns on a global basis and we believe our current investment activity is creating meaningful value for shareholders.","Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic expansion keeps plodding along. In the U.S., the recovery is now in its 11th year and earlier this month, became the longest expansion on record. Nonetheless , both fiscal and monetary policy remains supportive. And the U.S. remains a relative bright spot in terms of global economic growth. As you've heard me say many times before data center demand is not directly correlated to job growth.","We are fortunate to be operating in a business-levered to secular demand drivers both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business.","I'd like to draw your attention to Page 7. As you can see, McKinsey estimates that digital transformation will add $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030 driving demand for distributed digital infrastructures that we are uniquely positioned to address.","Thanks to our fit for purpose global footprint and interconnected scale. During the second quarter, we saw early indicators of digital transformation demand on our platform. We captured a record number of new logos, led by our enterprise vertical as these customers begin to deploy and connect components of their digital infrastructure globally.","Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business and the relevance of our portfolio to meeting these needs. We believe, we are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees whatever the macro environment may hold in store.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power","Thank you, Bill.","Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. We signed total bookings of $62 million including $6 million from our Latin America platform, Ascenty at our pro rata share and a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $53 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over five years, including an $8 million colocation contribution.","As Bill mentioned, this was our third best total bookings quarter and our second best interconnection quarter. I'd also like to clarify that Ascenty's second quarter bookings are in addition to the leases signed in the first quarter with a leading global cloud provider to anchor our entry into Chile.","We also expanded our digital realty colocation offering into the Asia-Pacific region with a multi-market new transaction and customer expansion, as you can see from the leasing activity table in our press release.","Although this was a relatively small transaction, hopefully, it is a Harbinger of bigger things to come as we move towards officially launching our first fully productized colocation offering in the region later this year.","In general, we are winning a greater share overall as well as larger and multi-market and multi-geo colocation deals, reflecting our growing traction within the enterprise segment and these customers' global hybrid cloud use cases.","Some of these wins are landing in non-productized colocation data centers. Even though these customers are consuming remote hand services and interconnection solutions commonly associated within colocation facilities. As product lines continue to blur, we are contemplating changes to our disclosure to provide insight consistent with the way we run the business.","We will keep you apprised as we contemplate future changes to our disclosure with an eye towards maintaining transparent shareholder friendly communication while balancing continuity against the evolution of our business.","During the second quarter, we delivered solid leasing volume up 24% sequentially with balanced performance across sectors, products and geographies. We are also seeing an acceleration of our channel business with healthy double-digit growth relative to the first half of 2018.","We added an all-time high 57 new logos during the second quarter, led by strength in our Enterprise segment, which accounted for 40 new logos. This was also a record quarter for new logos sourced through our channel partners, who contributed more new logos in the first half of this year, than they contributed all of last year.","We are gaining traction within the enterprise segment of customers deploying hybrid multi cloud connected deployments globally through direct and partnership business combining the best of our ecosystems.","Second quarter highlights include HCL, an alliance partner is one of the largest next generation technology companies that help enterprises reimagine their businesses. HCL selected Digital Realty to host their Oracle Demantra infrastructure and SAP cloud environments. This deployment is on behalf of a top 10 U.S.-based food and beverage company with over $10 billion in revenue and a global distribution network.","Digital Realty's global platform paired with HCL's expertise and product management, market analytics and sales force management solutions enables HCL's customer to be highly responsive to the evolving pace of consumers worldwide. We continue to benefit from our strategic partnerships, including IBM, a major global automobile manufacturer is relocating their corporate headquarters to be closer to their strategic alliance partners.","As part of the relocation, the auto manufacturer is leveraging IBM Direct Link dedicated hosting to enable their VMware environment to harness the power and flexibility of the IBM cloud. This hybrid cloud deployment enables fast direct connectivity of its legacy finance application built on an IBM mainframe to their virtualized environment hosted on the IBM Cloud through a digital realty fiber cross connect. The strategic partnership between Digital Realty and IBM enabled a seamless migration plan for the customer and secured the win for both companies.","A large global multi conglomerate manufacturing and services company chose Digital Realty to deploy its edge networking node in our London data center. This company is working with our partner IBM to rightsize their data center footprint and manage their accelerating cloud sprawl and ballooning costs.","The client chose Digital Realty as a key component of this complete digital refresh to utilize the speed, security and reliability of IBM Direct Link dedicated capabilities in our London location. By connecting to the multi-zone regional hub, IBM has deployed in our data center, our client can move vast amounts of data quickly and securely between co-located and cloud-based resources allowing them to deliver any application globally, where and when it is needed.","We continue to see traction with our global interconnection platform. Mavenir, the only End-to-End, Cloud-Native Network Software Provider for cloud service providers is redefining network economics through automation products and solutions.","By leveraging Digital Realty's service exchange, Mavenir is able to offer diverse passing with multiple ways to connect data center environments and ensure 99.999% uptime across their strategic global locations positioning them for continued expansion of their global service delivery.","Let's turn to the composition of our customer base on Page 12. Don't forget, the cloud lives in a data center, in fact it probably lives in a Digital Realty data center as you can see from the global accounts that make up over one-third of our customer base.","The network segment makes up over 25% of our customer base, and these pipes that connect customers to the clouds aren't going anywhere, regardless which workloads eventually migrate to the cloud. Resellers account for 15% of our total revenue. We think our reseller concentration is a little bit unique, not least because we have over nine years of remaining lease term with these customers and these customers are typically deployed in multiple markets around the world with us as their global partner of choice.","Last but not least, Enterprise represents a little less than 25% of our total pie. Here again, we think our concentration is a little bit unique. The financial services sector has long been our largest enterprise vertical.","These customers are highly regulated, typically risk averse and symbiotic repeat buyers as evidenced by the new business we did during the second quarter. Three of our top 10 deals were with existing financial services customers. We also see the growth in FinTech being relevant to our platform as they evolve their architectures to achieve, efficient data analytics out of their hybrid multicloud architectures.","All of which is to say, it's a hybrid multi cloud world and we believe our fit for purpose portfolio is uniquely well suited to solve for the full supply chain.","Turning to our backlog on Page 13. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from $144 million as of March 31, to $127 million at the end of the second quarter, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Ascenty.","I'd like to point out that we've shown here the backlog for our consolidated portfolio which ties to the top line of our P&L. And we have also reflected our pro rata share of the backlog from unconsolidated joint ventures, which runs through the equity and unconsolidated JV line item, at the top of the bars on this chart. During the second quarter, the lag between signings and commencements was slightly above our long-term historical average at eight months.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity. On Page 14, we signed a $125 million of renewals during the quarter in addition to new leases signed. This was the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history. Following the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. Incidentally, the $116 million in 1Q '19 is now the third-highest. So our top three renewal quarters have all come within the last nine months .","As you may recall, 2019 was our historical high watermark in terms of lease expirations. Halfway through the year, we have reduced our expirations down from 23% of total revenue as of 3Q '18 to less than 10% remaining as of June 30 while also extending our contracts expire and beyond 2019. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the second quarter was nearly five years while cash rents on renewals rolled down 5.8%.","We've delivered positive cash and GAAP re-leasing spreads in each of the past four years and although rents have been rolling down in 2019, our renewal leasing activity has been in line with our expectations, both in terms of volume, as well as rate.","As I previously mentioned, we believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer, we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio .","And whenever, we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings including both new business as well as renewals. In terms of second quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 80 basis points to 87.8% due to the customer bankruptcy we mentioned last quarter, as well as development deliveries placing servers in Frankfurt and Osaka, two of our tightest global metros.","Same capital cash NOI was down 5%. This includes a 90 basis point FX headwind and you may also recall that we flagged last quarter that we faced a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund, we collected in the second quarter of last year.","We faced somewhat of a double whammy on the property tax line as we were hit with dramatically higher assessments in the Central region, this quarter, in addition to the refund in the year ago quarter. We intend to vigorously contest these unreasonable assessments and we have an excellent track record of prevailing on appeal.","As evidenced by the sizable refund collected in the second quarter of last year. In the meantime, however, we are required to accrue based on the higher assessed values, which unfortunately introduces some volatility in the property tax line item.","The U.S. dollar remains elevated relative to prior year exchange rates and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 15.","Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 16. We manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt, to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing.","Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with a long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full-year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded.","In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was down 1.6% year over year or essentially flat on a constant currency basis, primarily due to a tough comp from the sizable property tax refund in the second quarter of last year.","As you can see from the bridge chart on Page 17, we do expect the quarterly run rate to dip back down in the second half of the year, primarily due to stiffer foreign currency headwinds as the dollar has continued to strengthen over the course of the year, along with a higher share count from settling the forward equity offering.","As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance, although there are few puts and takes in the drivers this quarter. As you may recall, we raised the range for net income by $0.25 last quarter to reflect the non-core activity running through the P&L, most notably the unrealized gain on the contribution of Ascenty to the joint venture with Brookfield.","We are bringing the net income range back down by $0.15 this quarter to reflect the loss on early retirement of debt from the opportunistic refinancing of our 2020 and 2021 bond maturities at a 60 basis point savings as well as a non-cash Topic D-42 Charge from the redemption of our Series H preferred stock, which we replaced with our new Series K preferred at a 150 basis point tighter coupon. Both of these financing charges are added back to core FFO.","Moving up the guidance table from the net income line, under the balance sheet section, we've updated our assumptions to reflect the actual outcomes on the refinancings I just mentioned. We've also raised our recurring CapEx guidance by $15 million. The higher recurring CapEx guide is not due to higher capital spending on the physical plant, but it's entirely due to capitalized leasing commissions on several strategic renewal transactions and is directly associated with locking in long-term contractual cash flow streams.","Last but not least, our expectation for cash re-leasing spreads has improved from down high single-digits to down mid-single digits due to the evolving commercial terms on the mix of renewal transactions we currently expect to execute this year.","We are keenly aware of the highly competitive dynamic, particularly in select U.S. markets, but nonetheless, the cash rent roll-down on our - in 2019 vintage expiration does not appear to be as pronounced as previously believed.","In addition, although we are pleased with the trajectory of our quarter-over-quarter improvement in bookings, including a 24% increase this past quarter. Most of this activity has been concentrated in facilities still under construction. Given the eight month lag between signings and commencements, recent bookings won't really move the top line needle in calendar year 2019. Although the composition of our recent activity does position our sales team with incremental move-in ready opportunities to be offering customers in the back half of this year.","Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 18. Net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the second quarter while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.2 times. Pro forma for settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt to EBITDA remains in-line with our targeted range at 5.5 times, while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times.","In addition to proceeds from the forward equity offering, we expect to begin to realize the latent cash flow capacity from signed leases, including the 24 megawatts Ascenty just delivered, which are coming online in the third quarter, but which are not contributing to our last quarter annualized credit stats.","Over time, we also expect to use proceeds from our capital recycling program to maintain our target leverage profile. In terms of second quarter capital markets activities, as previously mentioned, in early April, we completed the redemption of all 365 million of our 7.375% Series H preferred stock which we replaced with 210 million of permanent capital under our Series K Perpetual Preferred at 5.85% a savings of over 150 basis points.","In June, we capitalized on favorable market conditions to raise $900 million of 10-year to U.S. dollars bonds at 3.6%. The lowest coupon we have ever achieved on a dollar denominated 10-year paper. This was an opportunistic liability management exercise and we use the proceeds to tender for our 3.4% notes due 2020 and our 5.25% senior notes due 2021. A little over 80% of the outstanding bonds were tendered during the second quarter and we settled the redemption of the remaining 20% in mid-July.","This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.","As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 19, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by nearly half a year to 6.4 years and lowered our weighted average coupon by 10 basis points to 3.3%. A little over half of our debt is non- U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. Finally, as you can see from the left side of our Page 19, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years.","Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we'd be pleased to take your questions.","Andrew, would you please begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.","Jon Atkin","I have a couple of operational questions. I guess, first by region, in the major U.S. markets, so I'm wondering, where you see the leasing or demand pipeline, the strongest or quarter-to-date bookings geographically where that has been strongest? I think Bill mentioned a couple of examples in the script.","And then on Asia and specifically Korea, I wondered, how you kind of view the puts and takes about deploying capital in that market given the large role that could shape or play in accommodating the hyperscale demand so far in that market and what is arguably lower colocation pricing, than in rest of Asia. And then finally on Europe, I just wondered the new land parcel in Hattersheim and expectations around how quickly one could potentially develop capacity there? Finally, just London, I don't think you mentioned that in your script, but any kind of updated views on the demand dynamics in the London market? Thanks.","Andrew Power","I'll try to weave the questions into a couple coherent answers, and I think we're going to probably ping-pong around the team here. So first off, U.S. markets, I would say this, the second quarter was accentuated with some pockets of strength in some more unusual places. As well some places where we've been pretty consistent kind of working from East to West, the Northern New Jersey, New York metro market that is continue to tighten.","And we saw few wins in the financial services and other related verticals in that market during the quarter hop down to Dallas our Richardson campus. We continue to expand with both our existing and new customers landing on that campus and quite pleased with the progress on that market. And then over to the West Coast Santa Clara, obviously a very, very tight market we had both enterprise related and also top cloud service provider wins during 2Q.","Looking a little bit into crystal ball more into back half of the year, I would say the Toronto market, where we had some great wins earlier in the year continues to be very tight. I think we're very well positioned with our campus location in that market. A brand new asset and we've had a few customers landing and also looking to expand in that location. We are looking at the incremental opportunities in - New York metro area.","And also two markets, obviously a little bit more challenge for both Northern Virginia and Chicago. Bill related some of the good news on Chicago. So we're hoping for some green shoots there and in Northern Virginia we're also working on some capacity, some existing customers looking to expand with adjacency as well as some new customers looking to land on our market leading campus.","I think you touched on London and Europe, maybe I'll hit that and then hand off Korea to Bill or maybe Craig can chime in on Frankfurt portion. So maybe on the front end, the Frankfurt-market as we mentioned has been one of our hottest markets, we initially ended that market just a few years ago. I think our first anchor customer was a top 3 CSP. We subsequently grew with an enterprise customer.","And if you could see the absorption on our leasing table and developments, that was certainly our star for the quarter and we\u2019re rapidly running out of capacity in that market. Maybe Greg, do you want to talk about some of the activity in our other release there in terms of expanding.","Gregory Wright","Well, first of all - I think one of the question, was in terms of Frankfurt - sorry I think one of the first question was in terms of Frankfurt in terms of potential timing. Look the contract is subject to conditions including power zoning and planning and that will probably take roughly 24 to 30 months, but again in terms of the layout of the site and the potential for the site. As we said, it's only 3 miles from the Frankfurt airport. We're very excited about that.","And lastly over in Europe, London we\u2019re pretty excited about opening up our Cloud House in Docklands\u2019 campus strategy, a highly interconnected series of buildings in the Docklands of London. And we've been working on some strategic colocation story and wins in that market. We also have had some increase on our Crawley Campus and in some other pockets within the London portfolio.","So seeing some good opportunities in that market as well, Bill, maybe you want to kick back to John's questions on Korea.","William Stein","I think Korea could be - we think Korea is going to be pretty similar to Japan in terms of how it plays out. We're not - we haven\u2019t decided yet whether we're going to pursue that on our own or with a partner, but clearly we went into Osaka several years ago. Created a connected campus that's worked out extremely well for us and likewise, we've been building up in Tokyo. So Seoul is really the next leg of that strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Funk","And I guess the first one is kind of follow-up Bill, earlier this year, I think you made some comments that looking to the second half, your trajectory for bookings that with a funnel look looked relatively strong and I think there has been some mixed commentary out there across the industry. So maybe, just an update, on your earlier comments in this year, about the second half of 2019?","William Stein","I'm sure, Michael. Well I mean, I think - that our performance hopefully in the second quarter is consistent with what we said in March, when we said we weren't going to write-off the balance of the year and I think clearly that's not the case. I think if you look at the second quarter versus first, there is a clear positive momentum and acceleration. It's our third highest bookings quarter, as Andy said, with a record number of new logos, standing at 57.","And frankly, we expect continued improvement during the balance of the year. It's great to be able to leverage our global footprint. And that's how that's working out. So we expect that international is going to play a major role in the back half of the year. But we still would see a fair share of bookings coming out of North America.","To sum up, we remain highly confident in the long-term - demand drivers for our business. Those being big data, mobile and Internet of Things and we really like our position given the strength of our global diversified platform.","Michael Funk","And just related question as well, thinking about the new market entry and the expansion that you announced today. Maybe just kind of walk through - I guess the intelligence, the thought process and even the - that the mind of the customer relationships and what you know about their expansion and how that maybe direct some of that new market entry. And the I guess the visibility that gives you into entering the new markets like South Korea and expanded in Frankfurt?","William Stein","Well this new market entry, and the expansion into - expansion Frankfurt, the re-entry into Paris. It's all based on conversations that we have with our customers. So it's - we're not going into these markets on a purely speculative basis. It is more than one customers do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler","So just wanted to - you touched on Northern Virginia a little bit in your prepared remarks as being oversupplied. And you also alluded to that potentially creating some opportunities I\u2019ll be curious about those opportunities if you could sort of talk about anything that you're seeing there. And then separately Andy in contrast as you were talking about some of the market strength in the back half you mentioned Northern Virginia, which kind of surprised me a little bit as it sounds like that's got the potential to pick up a little bit.","Are you - you\u2019ve good line of sight there in the second half or is that just you see customers kicking around some requirements and expecting to land somewhere, potentially with you guys.","William Stein","So, in regards to my commentary, I was speaking to our dialogues with our customers and so, not on a speculatively basis, really what we're seeing in terms of opportunities. Listen, Northern Virginia Ashburn obviously the largest market in the world. It's been the most robust and diverse. At the same time, it's become one of our most competitive markets and we're certainly seeing some pricing pressure on new opportunities while at the same time, some of our larger customers have been in code digestion mode for the first half of this year.","We think that this market is going to work through this current supply demand challenge and we're optimistic on the market. We think these hyperscales are going to resume their growth and we are seeing some green shoots around some of these private outfits, not just in that market, but broadly speaking. Some of the private outfits who have entered the market in the last 12 to 18 months, who will either not move forward with speculative capacity or we have even seen signs where some of our selling land that they previously bought to build data center capacity.","In the meantime, we're just being picking our spots so we're trying to find places where we compete beyond price, where our unique global platform can add substantial value that is customers who need a global partner in the full product suite. It's our installed and growing customer base on our Northern Virginia campuses that wants to grow with adjacency. And then lastly, it's customers to place value on the longest runway for growth for their deployments in that market, which they find in our campuses.","Jordan Sadler","So on the opportunity side, it sounds like there maybe some land parcels for example that maybe you guys might be able to pick up. And then separately on the leasing front, it sounds like you've got capacity coming online and even though that you have tenants who have been waiting like passes deliver which could lineup well for you guys in the second half. Is that fair?","William Stein","Well, I would just put some finer details, but I don't think we're - I think we\u2019ll feel pretty good of our supply chain in Ashburn and other markets. And it\u2019s these much more tighter markets be it a Paris or Frankfurt, South Korea, new market entry where we're focused on the land. So I don't see us other than the small parcels that really physically connected the campuses and added incremental Ingress\/Egress to an existing campus partially owned. I don't see this picking up those land parcels.","I do see as a good sign as potential competitor, the tide of potential competitors subsiding a little bit here, which helps overall backdrop. But going back to the demand that I was referencing, it hits all those highlights I was talking about, it was international customers looking for global partners across the full product spectrum. It's customers that landed in like certain building already on our campus and wants to grow 1 megawatt or 2 megawatts right next door.","It's the larger customers who - we\u2019ve already built the entire shell for and they're building out their capacity and call it three, six megawatt chunks and I have kind of anchored all their infrastructure on our campus. And lastly it specific customers that say, this is not my first time to lay my workload. I need to find a partner that is going to give me a really long runway for growth and they find that with Digital Realty. So all those are kind of examples I can think of mine of either opportunities we land in recent quarters or opportunities we're working on right now, in a still fairly competitive Ashburn market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Erik Rasmussen","I'm just going to circle back with Nova once again. You talked about the supply demand imbalance and then more supply coming online. And then still sort of the market in digestion mode, but just trying to balance that and understand your thoughts on maybe and the confidence level you\u2019ve seen some pick up.","Obviously you're going to have some supply - your own supplier capacity coming online. But what is that then do in terms of pricing I mean are we really looking at a challenge to get to that low end of your pricing range in that market, and development yields?","William Stein","That's a market where there are certain private smaller location operators that are solely competing on price. That will likely in deals just to fill capacity and my guess is will be a short-lived run in our business quite honestly, given the competition. We're picking our spots. We're trying to find customers that really value our product offering and not just going to the lowest common denominator on price and we've been winning on those merits for some time.","So obviously that's a market where the pricing has been under pressure given the relative supply demand backdrop. What I would - Eric what my comment really goes to is I don't think demand is bearing as some might suspect, and that's based on conversations we're having live with our customers. And we're going to pick our spots and be competitive and work through a potential temporary dislocation this market.","And in fact, when you look at this in the broader digital realty, platform backdrop I think it's just a small piece of our puzzle as you saw from a quarter where we sequentially increased the signings 24 plus percent put up our bronze medal or number three in our records and Ashburn really didn't play to master amount to those signings at all. So I think we're going to work through this and come out the other side of this just fine.","Erik Rasmussen","And maybe just on the same cash NOI forecast. You reduce that to the mid-single digits versus high-single digits. How should we think about this and beyond this year and then will the headwinds from the legacy DFT business be completed this year?","Andrew Power","Sure so the - what I would say on that front. So we - got a couple things going against us in terms of the same-store pool. Obviously that the FX which we highlighted in the script, we also had the customer bankruptcy that we reserve for last quarter and it's going to flow through this quarter.","There also - we also had a tough comp in terms of real estate property taxes. Quarter a year ago had some benefits. This quarter we started accruing for one of our central regions. If you net that out, it's not quite as bad on a kind of same-store basis, I think negative 5 is like closer to negative 2.5 when you kind of do the normalizations on both periods and the negative, it's really due to in our largest exploration year and despite quite strong retention. We've had some down time when released in capacity.","As we also highlighted in our script quite pleased with the trajectory of the new signings the 57 new logos, great interconnection signings, multimarket, multi-GO colocation APAC. But there was one point, it's the signed commences, close to eight months.","So in year 2019 contribution that might flow through that same-store pool is not as great as we'd like it to be in - the flip side of that that leaves inventory for our sales reps to be selling moving ready space in some hot markets and you could see in our self we will have capacity sitting available in a market like Amsterdam, which is obviously tightening on the backdrop of some of the municipality, moratoriums. Osaka, which has been a harder market and even three meg sitting in Frankfurt. We're quite honestly will probably be a food fight over that last capacity on that campus.","And then lastly, I would just say while the same-store pool is very valid and very instrumental looking our financials, our dialogs with our customers is a total commercial package. So we're often tying in multiple product lines, new signings and renewals and a complex commercial solutions for our customers.","So some often like a little bit in this quarter and certainly in the prior quarter, we may give a customer some relief on existing contract, but we're winning incremental on a share of their business and good returns and it's a win-win for the customer benefiting from platform digital and a commercial win for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","First, if you could talk a little bit about just broadly the cloud impact that you're seeing on your business in terms of just the direction of bookings as well as what you're seeing on churn and the pace of migrations to the cloud from your customers? And then secondly if you could talk a little bit about what happened in terms of - I think it was the renewal rate in the PBB business and just maybe what caused the dip there? Thanks.","William Stein","Mike, I'll take your first question, Andy will take your second. Relative to the cloud, it's been - as you might expect a significant source of demand for us, and we haven't seen the pickup in churn that some of the others have you mentioned some of our peers have mentioned on the calls, I mean look this we've mentioned this is the third-highest booking quarter we've had huge number of international wins, 57 new logos, which was a record, second highest volume in cross connect bookings and we really do see the world. moving to a hybrid multi cloud architecture.","And Digital is focused on the enterprise and we think our offerings such as the Service Exchange really enable to shift to a hybrid multi cloud. If cloud ultimately resides in a data center and they leave they sit in an awful lot of our data centers and they're signing many long-term deals with us.","So we think we're really, really well positioned to benefit from the growth in cloud demand, but we're also very focused on attracting enterprise customers to sit both in our data center and connect to the clouds on our campuses. Andy do you want handle the second?","Andrew Power","And Michael, just so I make sure I address your second question. You mind repeating that you said the renewal rate on the PBB?","Michael Rollins","Yes. So if I look at the page 22, I'm sorry, 21 this quarter. I think the PBB retention ratio dropped to that 22.6% from the LTM of 93.5% and was curious if there is anything specific that cause the drop there?","Andrew Power","Yes. I think what you have is a little bit of a small sample set as you can see, especially on the square footage 39,000 versus almost 2 million a square feet in the prior quarter. So it's literally only four renewal contracts that happened this quarter. So 1, 1.5 depending on the square footage rating renewed.","I believe that was a customer in our Houston footprint, not a large market for Digital Realty or a major focus and I think we only have a site or two in that market, but I would say it's pretty much an anomaly.","And as you recall from last quarter, those power based buildings are typically very high retention rates and use the longest duration renewals given the fact that the customer is often putting even more substantial capital commitment into that capacity. So I don't think there is a trend or anything in that renewals time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael","First up on the price renewal change the mid-single digits versus previously the high-single digits. Is that specifically because the legacy DuPont customer has not yet been renewed and is there now an expectation that they will not renew in 2019?","And then secondly, there is some things that seem like they would drive your core FFO guidance up. So there is a one-time U.K. tax benefits in the first quarter, it seems like the equity forward didn't come in as linearly as maybe what was anticipated, and then obviously, as we just mentioned the reduction in the renewal spread, are the offsets to why that might not have happened, if I have them correctly, the FX, the bankruptcy, the top real estate property taxes and then the longer book-to-bill.","And then just lastly, a higher level question, what does the capacity look like for the back half of this year in terms of available megawatts, if you will, in the markets where you're seeing the most demand. Do you have enough capacity effectively available you think in the markets where you're seeing the most demand to sustain the level of momentum you saw in the second quarter? Thank you.","Andrew Power","Thanks, Colby. I think there is a bunch of numbers questions in here. So let me try to tackle all three and no specific order. So actually, maybe I'll work in reverse order because it might be easier.","So available capacity, I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity in the back half of the year and you can see that either and what's on our development cycle in terms of unleased capacity or you can see in the pre-stabilized, just delivered and highlights in that - in those markets are as I mentioned, Frankfurt, Osaka, Amsterdam, London. These markets in our Latin America platform as well. So I think we're set up pretty nicely in terms of available capacity, they're coming on, back half of this year.","But as you know, as we move into the back of this year, we're also working on capacity that's even coming on line in early 2020. So and many of these tighter markets be the Tokyo and others, the customers really stretching out the timelines been coming to us even earlier given there such limited capacity.","What I'd like more in some of those markets, of course, Frankfurt\u2019s a market where we just seen a rapid acceleration. So and it's a tightening market hence it's been tough to get land parcels and quite pleased with a global investment team is great work and timing that down on the heels of our success. But net-net, I think we're in a pretty good space for back half of 2019 going into 2020. Markets coming online and with capacity in the backdrop attractive demand.","Going to - I think your guidance question, if you net out the outcome on the guidance, we obviously beat our internal numbers in the first quarter, largely due to some timings on the incentive close and our funding for bridging of our partners equity and being compensated for that.","And as you move into second quarter, we kind of came in line with our numbers and if you look at kind of the math, you pretty much need to kind of flat line-ish with the second quarter numbers into both Q3 and Q4 to kind of get roughly to the midpoint of our guidance.","I would say you've got a couple of things going on there. One, you can obviously - NOI coming online for capacity that are signed, but not commence. So that's the positive - the headwinds, which makes us reaffirm our guidance at its current range are, you have FX continuing to be a headwind one, a year-over-year basis.","Two, you have our equity forward which we delayed to match our sources and uses to later in the year, so the share count from that equity forward getting drawdown is going to come into the share count and then three, I mentioned the headwind with the property tax accrual. Again, we do look to try to modify those an appeal, but we're not going to win or any type of appeal on that in, call it three months time. So those are the offsetting headwinds.","And as I mentioned the signings while great quality on many metrics across the board, it does have a longer signed a commenced time period of eight months, so it's probably doing a little bit more - the second quarter signings are probably paying a little bit work to building this up for our 2020 numbers then actual in year 2019 contribution, but the positive - as I mentioned will leave us with moving ready capacity in several great markets for our sales reps to be selling into right now.","Last but not least on the guidance table, we did improve our expectations for our cash mark-to-market for the full year. We don't want to specify any specific confidential customer dealings. What I can tell you is among our large both legacy digital and legacy DFT customers, we're moving closer and closer to final resolution of the path forward on some of their capacity renewals.","We've worked with this customer who we've been helping in growing their capacity over the 12 \u2013 last 18 months. Across now, I think I believe all three of our connected Ashburn campus is the triangle that surround Loudon County.","We've been helping them with connectivity across these campuses. Their needs and requests over time have changed and I think the shape and form of that renewal will be constructive for both the customer and for digital and likely result in a little bit better outcome in terms of rate as we push out some of those contracts that do expire over several years to begin with. A couple of years from there into the future. So that was really the driver for the guidance table change. So we do expect to complete that renewal in short order.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Bill Stein for any closing remarks.","William Stein","Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the second quarter, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation.","We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers, delivering all-time high new logos, our second best renewal leasing in interconnection bookings and our third highest total bookings in our history.","We extended our global footprint and took steps to secure our supply chain with several strategic land acquisitions. We re-entered Paris, we secured our second campus in Frankfurt and announced our entry into South Korea.","We also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with the publication of our inaugural ESG report and our official recognition as an Energy Star Partner.","Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of another $900 million of long-term capital.","As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. I hope you enjoy the dark days of summer and hope to see many of you at marketplace live in New York in November.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

My name is Mary Ann, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the show over to Pamela Garibaldi, Investor Relations of Digital Realty. You may begin.","Pamela M. Garibaldi","Thank you very much.

If you have not, you can access one in the Investors section of our website at www.digitalrealty.com or you may call (415) 738-6500 to request a copy.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the management of Digital Realty may make forward-looking statements on this call.

Following management's remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael F. Foust","Thank you Pamela, and welcome to the call, everyone. I will begin today's call with a brief summary of our second quarter operations. After my comments, Bill will discuss our second quarter financial results, capital markets activities and the revised 2013 guidance. Following his remarks, we will open the call to questions.","We continue to experience strong leasing momentum and demand across our portfolio, particularly with our traditional customer base. That base consists of large corporate enterprise users, cloud infrastructure providers and Internet-based applications and services, including e-retail. They rely on Digital Realty to provide a dependable and secure environment for storage and processing of mission-critical electronic information, as well as housing primary IT applications. These corporate enterprise customers, representing leading companies from financial services, consumer and health care sectors, among others, often require large, multisite builds that deliver high-quality, long-term revenue for Digital Realty.","Looking forward, we're implementing several strategic initiatives that will make our best-in-class data center platform more accessible to a wide range of enterprise customers and IT service providers. One such initiative is the transition of our sales team from one highly focused on opportunity management to a more diversified approach and raising [ph] a heightened focus on strategic account management under the leadership of Matt Miszewski, our Senior Vice President of Sales. This transition will match our market segmentation to our strategic sales effort and is designed to result in higher average deal sizes, shorter deal cycles and increased pricing power.","We've also been working to implement a diversification revenue enhancement strategy by targeting mid-market customer segments within specific verticals selected for their growth potential. These targets will include companies that meet Digital's ideal customer profiles and as such, represent latent market demand and are positioned within verticals that represent higher probabilities of closure for Digital. Together, we're confident that the new strategic account management and mid-market strategies will capture incremental demand and provide us with a more diversified and predictable view toward our quarterly leasing results. These programs, combined with our connectivity ecosystem initiative and the data center infrastructure management, the DCIM offering, are critical components of our evolution. By leveraging our scale, operational expertise, global footprint and financial resources, our goal is to capitalize on our first-mover advantage by creating an unmatched data center offering for large and small enterprise requirements that would be very difficult to replicate in the marketplace. We are excited by the growth prospects from these initiatives and believe they further increase the high barriers to entry in our business.","During the second quarter, leases were signed representing $16 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. And we're pleased to report that the remaining leases we expected to sign by June 30 have been complete since the quarter end. These additional lease signings totaled $19.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, bringing the total combined total to approximately $35.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue. And this is in line with our original expectations and reflects level demand we're experiencing across our portfolio. It is important to note that with the exception of the one lease that was completed yesterday, the July signings are not included in our third quarter leasing goals, which are tracking as expected. We remain confident that we will meet our new leasing expectations for the year.","Evidence of positive trends in the leasing environment is the solid pricing we've achieved, which we believe reflects improved market conditions in some markets, such as Ashburn, Virginia. The average annual rental rate for leases signed in the second quarter in North America for our Turn-Key Flex space was $209 per foot, and that's on a GAAP basis, which includes 2 power expansions signed in the second quarter. Excluding the power expansions, the rates averaged $177 per square foot, up significantly from our rolling 4-quarter average rate of $153 per foot. On a per kilowatt per month basis, the weighted average rate was approximately $178.","Our current backlog, including leases signed to date, totals $95.2 million of annualized GAAP revenues, of which, $43.2 million are expected to commence in 2013, $31.6 million expected to commence in 2014, '15 and $20.5 million are expected to commence between 2016 and 2018. Please note that our backlog represents committed lease contracts that have been signed but have not yet commenced. These lease signings represent a wide variety of industry verticals, including financial services, colocation, IT services, online retailing and health care. Our unparalleled global footprint, which spans over 30 markets around the world, played a key role in capturing this demand. Markets where we experienced most activities were Boston, Northern Virginia, Chicago, Houston, Austin, Phoenix, our new site in Toronto, as well as internationally, London, Sydney and Singapore, outside of North America.","The weighted average projected at year 1 stabilized return on investment for Turn-Key Flex leases signed in the first half of 2013 was approximately a healthy 12.4%. And this is consistent with historical trends and in line with our projected range of ROI of 11% to 14%. The current leasing prospect pipeline for new facilities stands at 1.8 million square feet, down from last quarter, largely due to the volume of leases we signed since the end of the first quarter. This figure represents current prospects in our sales funnel to whom we've made proposals and which we believe have 30% or greater likelihood of signing.","In addition to the new strategies I mentioned, macro trends reflect a solid demand outlook that we believe will add to the current pipeline. First, big data has started to result in real, large-scale enterprise data center demand. In addition, the computational effort needed to accomplish the analytics attached to big data further increases both the space and power needed by our customers and our prospects. This is in addition to the network capacity demanded and utilized by these users. Second, the mobile revolution has increased back-office computational needs and has driven the adoption of internal clouds to service newly developed mobile enterprise application. Furthermore, the move to the cloud is driving a transition to internal cloud platforms that answer the data center space and power needed by enterprises, while they continue to support their legacy environments. To the degree to which growth is incurring in the public cloud and hybrid cloud spaces, we are also seeing positive impact to our business from both the growth of cloud providers, whom we count as customers, as well as enterprise connectivity to multiple cloud service providers, which can now be supported by our new global network ecosystem.","Turning now to our re-leasing activity. Turn-Key Flex rates on renewals were up nearly 1% on a cash basis and up 8.6% on a GAAP basis in the quarter. Powered Base Building renewal rates were up 1.7% on a cash basis and up fully 27.5% on a GAAP basis. And colocation renewal rates were up 3.6% on a cash basis and up 14.7% on a GAAP basis. These re-leasing spreads were stronger than we projected. And for the remainder of the year, we are projecting rent spreads for data center space overall to be up 2.8% on a cash basis and up approximately 28.6% on a GAAP basis.","However, there are a few Turn-Key Flex leases that we expect to renew during the second half of the year, which we expect to roll down from currently very high rates. We expect re-leasing spreads for Turn-Key space to be down approximately 13.6% on a cash basis and up 3% on a GAAP basis for the remainder of the year. Offsetting the decrease, we expect re-leasing spreads for Powered Base Building, which include early renewals, to be up approximately 12.9% on a cash basis and up a very healthy 44.5% on a GAAP basis.","Occupancy decreased slightly during the quarter, primarily due to the expiration of non-data center leases. Excluding the nontechnical space, data center occupancy remains strong at 95.5% in the second quarter compared to 95.9% in the first quarter. In terms of supply and demand in our major U.S. markets, we're tracking a 12.8 megawatt shortfall of space nationwide overall. Specifically, we are enthusiastic about the dynamics we are seeing in Northern Virginia, the New York, New Jersey, Metro, Houston, Austin, Chicago, London, Amsterdam and generally in Asia-Pac.","Turning now to our acquisitions program. Our strategy consists of targeting institutional-quality operating data centers, including sale-leaseback transactions, wherein users are looking to monetize their real estate assets while partnering with an operator that can support their ongoing data center operations. In addition, we acquired development sites to add future inventory in top global markets, where our customers need to locate their data center operations. During the second quarter, we added 1 development site and 2 income properties to our portfolio, including the sale-leaseback transaction we announced earlier this week in the Netherlands, with international network provider, KPN. In addition, we acquired the 6-building complex in Austin that is home to several data center network providers and other technology firms.","Excluding the development site in Metro London, the average going-in cash cap rate for the second quarter transaction was 8.5%. As of June 30, we have completed $138.1 million in acquisitions at an average going-in cash cap rate for the income-producing properties of 10%. And this is well ahead of our guidance range of 7.25% to 7.75%. Our current pipeline of potential acquisitions totaled approximately $750 million, including high-quality, stabilized properties, value-add opportunities, roundup development sites, as well as sale-leaseback transactions. This excludes larger portfolios that we continue to track.","Pricing in the U.S. has risen rapidly for stabilized long-term lease properties in major markets. Cap rates in the high 5s to mid-6s are becoming the norm, largely driven by core institutional investors and a couple of nontraded REITs. While this is a great reflection of the true NAV of our digital portfolio, it does make purchasing income properties become more challenging. However, with our operating, leasing and development platforms, we are quite competitive in situations were some in-place leases have less than 7 or 10 years remaining or there might be a value-add component that we can underwrite as a developer of data centers.","I would now like to provide a brief update on the progress we are making on our digital ecosystem connectivity initiative. Our digital Ashburn, Virginia and Richardson, Texas campuses and our London sites are all tied together via dark fiber. Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Silicon Valley and New York Metro, including New Jersey, are in the final planning phases and we are well on our way to meeting our U.S. deployment expectations by year-end 2013. In addition, at our North American locations, we can now directly provide customers with IP network services, greatly facilitating new data center deployments and expansions.","In fact, we're already seeing results, including from our London deployment. We were able to expand a subsidiary of a Fortune 100 customer 2 sites at Woking and Redhill, in large part due to the site's interconnectivity. Essentially, the dual-site requirement was predicated on the customer's ability to access and procure a significant number of dark fibers, which the customer have been controlling in support of their heavy content distribution needs between the 2 sites. In addition, the direct access we provide to key London and European Internet exchange facilities was an important prerequisite for the customer. Overall, we significantly reduced this customer's annual network cost, further lowering their total cost of occupancy in digital properties. We continue to see growing demand from customers for enhanced Metro connectivity and the ecosystem initiative greatly expands the value we deliver to our customers.","We are very pleased with the progress we are making throughout our business and across our portfolio. 2013 is, in some ways, a transitional year for the company as we make significant enhancements to our portfolio and to our processes. We are already seeing the results of these efforts and expect to fully realize the benefits in 2014 and beyond. Ours is a dynamic and exciting sector that we believe requires both innovation and a global presence to address the future needs to our customers as they continue to embrace new technologies and compete in a globalized economy. More importantly, we believe that our talented professional team, superior delivery and operating platform, financial strength and investment expertise, Digital Realty has unparalleled competitive advantages as a global provider of data center solutions. As we work to further enhance and grow the business, we remain focused on enhancing our shareholder value.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by discussing changes to our accounting policies, as well as new disclosures in our quarterly supplementary report. I will then review our quarterly results, provide an update on our funding strategy and capital markets activities and address our revised guidance.","In terms of our accounting policies, to be more in line with GAAP accounting practices, in the second quarter, we began capitalizing all eligible portfolio-related costs totaling $10,000 or less, including those incurred in the first quarter. Previously, these costs were being expensed. In addition, we conformed [ph] our policy covering construction period offering cost with our interest capitalization policy, such that completion dates are now consistent. Our effective completion date is tied to receipt of certificate of occupancy. As a result, in the second quarter, we capitalized $3.4 million of additional operating repairs and maintenance and real estate tax expenses, of which, $1.5 million relates to the first quarter.","Separately, in response to requests from our shareholders, we have made additions and clarifications to our quarterly supplemental report. This includes a new schedule on Page 26, titled Portfolio Overview by Property Type. This schedule provides further visibility into our portfolio by consolidating our properties by corporate data center, Internet gateway, data center and nondata center properties. Within each property type, we have also provided detailed information around the annualized base rent by product type. In addition, on our historical capital expenditures schedule on Page 29, we have modified the footnotes to improve the definitions of how we categorize recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. These modifications have been made to further clarify how we define capital expenditures.","On Page 10 of the supplemental, capitalizing internal leasing commissions are now separately disclosed on the AFFO reconciliation. Recurring capital expenditures on our AFFO table now agrees to our historical capital expenditure table on Page 29. This modification was made to make reconciling the numbers easier. On Pages 9, 12 and 13 in the consolidated and same-store and new properties quarterly statements of operations and same-store operating trend summaries, we also broke out the repairs and maintenance line items from rental property operating expenses. As a reminder, this expense item is in addition to the recurring CapEx we spend to maintain our properties. These additions and enhancements are consistent with our policy of ensuring best-in-class reporting practices, as well as greater transparency for our shareholders. As always, we welcome your suggestions.","Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, second quarter 2013 FFO was $1.22 per share, up 5.2% from the first quarter 2013 FFO of $1.16 per share and up 11.9% from second quarter 2012 FFO of $1.09 per share.","Adjusting for items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, second quarter 2013 core FFO was $1.19 per share or $4.1 million lower than reported FFO. These adjustments consists of: a $5.6 million insurance settlement gain related to disputed construction costs from activities dating back to 2009; a $370,000 adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout, which were partially offset by $1.5 million of transaction expenses and a $500,000 write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the payoff of the mortgage at the Clonshaugh property in Ireland. As noted in the past, a fair value assessment of a 3-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required for each reporting period and is likely to result in some quarterly earnings fluctuations. Changes in fair value are considered noncore adjustments.","Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $7.4 million or 3.3% to $234.7 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $227.3 million last quarter. The increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing, acquisitions and the present value accretion related to the Sentrum earnout.","Looking at expense line items. Rental property operating expense decreased by $2.2 million to $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2013 from $29.1 million last quarter, primarily due to the changes to our cost capitalization policy that I just discussed and an adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout. During the quarter, repairs and maintenance expense was $22.3 million, down from $23.6 million in the first quarter, primarily due to also to changes in our capitalization policy.","Looking further down the income statement. Property taxes were $19.4 million in the second quarter, down from $21 million in the first quarter, primarily due to a favorable property tax adjustment for our 350 Cermak property that resulted from a lower tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to our tenants. G&A increased to $17.9 million in the second quarter compared to $16 million last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the continued growth of the company, as well as our independent directors' annual equity award grants that were fully vested and expensed during the quarter.","Interest expense decreased to $47.6 million in the second quarter compared to $48.1 million last quarter. Although gross interest increased in the second quarter due to additional borrowings, we capitalized $1.3 million of additional interest in the second quarter, primarily due to an aggregate increase in spending on qualified activities. Tax expense decreased to $210,000 in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $1.2 million last quarter, primarily due to noncash deferred tax benefit from foreign operations.","Lastly, preferred stock dividends increased to $11.4 million in the second quarter from $8.1 million last quarter due to the issuance of the Series G preferred stock in early April. As a result of the changes in our cost capitalization policy, NOI margins, excluding utility reimbursements, increased by 180 basis points to 76.1%. Excluding the expense reduction resulting from the changes in capitalization policy and the fair market value adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout, the NOI margin will be 74.9%, which is in line with historical levels.","Likewise, second quarter same-store NOI increased by $4.8 million to $200.2 million compared to $195.4 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $181 million in the second quarter, up $6.3 million from $174.7 million last quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was largely due to the incremental revenue from new leasing and reduction to operating expenses related to capitalization policy changes. Excluding the expense reduction resulting from the changes, same-store cash NOI would be $177.7 million, up $3 million compared to last quarter.","I would now like to turn to our funding strategy and capital markets activities. Our funding strategy includes issuing debt in local currencies to provide a natural hedge in mitigating our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and our growing international operations. Local debt as a percentage of regional assets ranges from 44% to 97%, depending on the currency. As part of this strategy, we are currently engaged in discussions to refinance our $1.8 billion global revolving credit facility, as well as our $750 million senior unsecured term loan. We're looking to take advantage of improved bank pricing in the loan market in light of the overall of volatility in interest rates. We expect to upsize both facilities, extend final maturities and modify certain covenants. In addition, we expect to have access to a number of additional currencies to help accommodate our growing global investment program.","We're also exploring a potential joint venture on a pool of our existing assets. With this joint venture, we would seek to establish a private market valuation on the contributed assets, while maintaining significant equity ownership and operational control of the assets, access the new source of capital at a cost well below the returns we expect to achieve on new investment opportunities and generate management fees and thus, a higher return on investment -- on our retained investment.","Turning to our balance sheet. Total assets grew to $9.2 billion in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $9 billion last quarter, which is consistent with the continued growth and scale of our business. Total debt for the second quarter was unchanged from last quarter at $4.7 billion. We currently have $1 billion of immediate liquidity, including funds that can be drawn on our existing global revolving credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility term loan, Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt. As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $1.8 billion global revolver was $784 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we've paid off 3 loans totaling $56.9 million. We now have $158 million remaining in principal amortization and debt maturities in 2013 with a weighted average cost of 6%. We plan to retire the remaining amount initially with the revolver and eventually refinance with additional long-term unsecured debt, secured debt and\/or preferred stock.","As stated in today's earnings release, with better visibility towards our year-end results, we are narrowing our 2013 core FFO guidance range to between $474 and -- $4.74 to $4.83 per share, increasing the low end by $0.04 and reducing the high end by $0.02. As a reminder, core FFO excludes items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams. In addition, we are raising our 2013 FFO guidance range to between $4.73 and $4.82 per share, increasing the low end by $0.08 and increasing the high end by $0.02. The incremental increase in FFO guidance compared to core FFO guidance is primarily driven by the one-time gain related to the insurance settlement of approximately $0.04 to FFO.","Furthermore, we now expect core FFO and FFO to be in line for the year. As a result, this guidance represents expected core FFO growth of 6.3% to 8.3% over 2012 core FFO of $4.46 per share and FFO growth of 6.5% to 8.6% over 2012 FFO of $4.44 per share. These revisions do not include the impact of the potential joint venture. With respect to the change, underlying our revised the 2013 guidance FX assumption, the impact from this change was more than offset by higher margins from the changes to our cost capitalization policy.","This concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Bill, I just wanted to just dive into the accounting things just for a moment. So you didn't restate first quarter results at all from FFO, you just adjusted FFO for the CapEx disclosure. But I'm more concerned about sort of earnings. So this $3.4 million change is effectively that $0.025 all in the second quarter?","Arthur William Stein","That's right. So roughly $0.01 of that would have been in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hilmoe of UBS.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bill, just a question on the joint venture. I guess, can you talk a little bit about potential size, who the -- what kind of partner might that be? And is this, in terms of the deal, like one large deal? Or is this kind of a staggered transaction that could close over a period of time?","Arthur William Stein","I'm reluctant to go into too much specificity before we close. But I will tell you it is one deal. Approximate deal size, we'll say, between $350 million and $400 million. It's one institutional investor. It's, I believe, a highly regarded institutional investor in the real estate space. And right now, we're expecting just -- I think I said one close, and that will -- I expect that will be in the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson of Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Can you talk a little bit about the Asia-Pacific business as to what you're seeing there in terms of opportunities to both expand and from a leasing standpoint?","Michael F. Foust","Sure. I'd be happy to. So we're seeing new opportunities in Japan. We expect to be closing soon on a development site outside of Osaka. We're moving ahead on schedule with our new development and joint venture with Savvis in Hong Kong and have very good interest in that new development. Also continue to discuss potential joint ventures with IT services companies in China, we'll see where that goes. And then we're seeing a pickup in leasing now in Singapore. It was a little slow for a couple of quarters, and now we're seeing requirements pick up in that market, which we know is going to be a very strong market ongoing for. So Asia, we see as having really good opportunities. And we have good activity in Sydney and Melbourne on those developments as well. You may recall, in Melbourne, NAB is the anchor tenant there and we have a couple of international firms as our anchor tenants in Sydney.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. So I was interested in what you're seeing in terms of competitive behavior. You talked a little bit about supply being scarce in a number of markets, the competitive behavior, and when deals go away from you, what's the most common reason? And then maybe just an update on the connectivity strategy. You mentioned where you hoped to be by yearend. But if you could elaborate on your ability to fully pursue that business in the U.S., given some of the exclusivity that Telx has to offer the interconnects within several of your sites.","Michael F. Foust","Sure. We have certainly a very large footprint in North America and globally, which allow us to provide a wide range of space both in our Internet gateway buildings, as well as in our suburban data center facilities. So we can provide that space, whether it's smaller colo space or larger wholesale space, over a megawatt, to these different corporates and IT services companies that are delivering cloud services and require that connectivity. So all in all, I think we're incredibly well-positioned to deliver the space and the connectivity within our buildings, within our business parks. And as we mentioned back to the major network and Internet peering points, whether they're at in an Equinix facility or driving more business as well to an Equinix or Savvis or other folks. So it generally should be a win-win because hopefully we'll be driving more connectivity and Internet traffic back to these various peering points, whether they're in a Digital building or in another location. I'm sorry, the other question. Sorry, when we're seeing competitors -- competitor pricing. Typically, when a deal is done away with us, it's usually on price, where in some cases, we just feel we won't go as low as some of the competitors might, especially some of these folks that have 1 or 2 sites and don't have a portfolio approach to their business necessarily. But oftentimes, we are able to achieve a premium over our competitors because of our service, our professional operational platform and the fact that we can -- because of our modular POD architecture approach, we can customize spaces even within our Turn-Key Flex designs to meet the application requirements of the IT department. And that's very powerful as well as having fully dedicated UPS and cooling to the suites. And having that dedicated backup power and cooling is a very important criteria, especially among the corporate enterprise financial services groups.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One question, 2 parts. So on the potential joint venture, the size was helpful. Should we expect pricing to be the range, Mike, that you offered up that you're seeing pricing in the private market, high 5s and mid-6s? And separately, as it relates to the guidance adjustment, what portion in total related to the accounting change? I think you said it was $3.5 million or $3.4 million of additional OpEx for the first half. So is it appropriate to annualize that, get to $7 million for the full year essentially of additional capitalized OpEx?","Arthur William Stein","Yes. Roughly $0.05 for the year from that, Jordan.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","$0.05 benefit?","Arthur William Stein","Roughly. Yes, I'd qualify [ph] that. And then in terms of the JV again, we're in negotiations with a partner now. So I'm reluctant to say too much. You can assume the cap rates are -- they'll be in rates that are attractive to us.","Michael F. Foust","Yes. I mean, they'll be significantly below our guidance for new acquisitions because of the long-term leases and stability in those assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Thanks for giving us the extra color on the leases that occurred in July. I was wondering if you might give us a little background there and maybe we can get a sense as to whether it was Turn-Key or Powered Base Building and if the rates were sort of in line with what you saw in the second quarter.","Michael F. Foust","Sure. Yes, it's a -- the leases were almost entirely Turn-Key Flex or fully fitted-out Custom Solutions that we'll be building. And in colo space, that's fully fitted-out colo space. And that's consistent with the trends we're seeing now. We are doing a few Powered Base Building leases but well over 90%. I think of the deals we're doing now are Turn-Key. And rates being pretty consistent with what we've been doing historically, probably be a little higher in that case. So a nice combination of existing customers, new customers and seeing a lot of expansion in multiple sites, as we mentioned around trends with big data and cloud and hybrid cloud.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just another question on July. Could you quantify how much of July's strong leasing, in other words, how much of that $19.5 million in rental revenue signed would you characterize as having been delayed from the second quarter versus what might just be ordinary July signings, so to speak? I'm just trying to get a feel for whether there's any acceleration in leasing in July versus what the monthly average throughout the second quarter was.","Michael F. Foust","Yes. Actually the great, great majority of what we achieved in the last 3 weeks were leases we expected to close by June 30 and spilled over. There might be a couple million dollars of revenue, $1.5 million to a couple million that we would consider third quarter deals. And we expect to third quarter to meet our expectations in terms of leasing velocity. So we're very comfortable that we're on track. It's hard to keep in the course of business to keep too specific dates and quarter-by-quarter. And so it's -- as you all can appreciate it, it's often better to view things on longer timeframes. But yes, the leasing velocity is very good, we think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart, Green Street Advisors.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Bill, just a couple additional follow-ups on the JV. First of all, the $350 million to $400 million amount that you referenced, is that the transaction size or is that proceeds? And are you talking about closer to the sale of a 50% interest or an 80% interest? And last but not least, have you seen any sensitivity from your partner on pricing, given the recent move in rates?","Arthur William Stein","So the $350 million is the total asset value. We are looking at 20-80 joint venture, where we'd be 20% and our partner would contribute 80%. So 80% of that $350 million to $400 million will be coming back to us. And we've seen no sensitivity as a result of those changing rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm trying to get my hands around the outlook for lease commencements. You've done about $53 million year-to-date. You have about another $43 million of leases signed but haven't commenced. Just kind of thinking about the back half of the year and where you were last year, you had $135 million, how comfortable you feel with the ability to kind of do better than that this year, given your outlook for the back half.","Michael F. Foust","We're certainly on track -- probably maybe even -- we're certainly on track to meet our budgets and our revenue expectations. We're probably lagging a little bit from a timing perspective, especially with these leases that are falling over by 3 or 4 weeks, do have an impact in terms of timing. But I mean, we're confident we'll be in our guidance range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach of ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, you mentioned that the leasing in the second quarter was consistent with kind of the new expectations for the year. I guess, can you just update us on the -- your sort of targets for leasing commenced space here in the 2013 and how that relates to what you achieved in 2012?","Michael F. Foust","We're certainly, on the lease signings, we're well ahead of where we were at this point in time in July of 2012. I don't know off the top of my head how far ahead we are in terms of lease signings.","Arthur William Stein","Roughly $80 million into mid-July equates to, I think, the first 3 quarters of last year for signings.","Michael F. Foust","So on signings, we're...","Arthur William Stein","2.5 months ahead.","Michael F. Foust","Right. So we're making very good progress on signings. As I said, the commencements have been delayed a little bit from our expectations, especially with the latest batch of signings in July, which is great. But they're a few weeks later than we anticipated. So that will have a bit of an effect on the higher end of commencements.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious on the comments about the sales force initiatives. You mentioned one of the benefits being hopefully getting some shorter leasing cycles there. I'm just curious, are you -- and just in relation to the comments about the commencements, but are you seeing any shortening in the leasing cycle today just as a result of changing business conditions or improving business conditions?","Michael F. Foust","Not with our larger enterprise customers, and for a variety reasons there. These are large deployments for them and in large internal budgets for their own IT deployment and their own costs over and above the data center we're providing. As you can imagine, there's more levels of approval now, even for budgeted items within most organizations of substance that we're dealing with. And we're doing more customization as well. With our Turn-Key Flex product, we're doing a lot of tailoring to the IT application requirements themselves and customers' operating program. So that's taking some additional time as we go through the design and engineering project with our -- process with our customers for our Turn-Key Flex POD approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. Bill, any interest in using proceeds from the joint venture to buy back stock at the current price? And then the second question -- well, let's just leave it there with that question.","Arthur William Stein","Bill, that's one of the alternatives, for sure. So when we close the venture, we'll have to look at what our investment opportunities are at the company. And depending upon investment opportunities, we would either use all the proceeds to pay down the revolver or the other alternative would be to make the use of proceeds leverage-neutral, which is to say partially to retire debt and partially to retire equity in accordance with our pro forma capitalization. And of course, we could do anything along that spectrum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman of Bank of America. There is no response from that line. Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman, Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman again. Bill, I was wondering maybe you can just explain a little bit more sort of what exactly, when you went through the maintenance and the change in capitalization policy: a, just really what the driver of the change was; two, I guess, why you felt that, that wasn't really material of putting that in the press release and the supplemental as sort of forewarning people beforehand just given how much scrutiny CapEx overall has received and the materiality of that being $0.05. And then lastly, from an FX perspective, I guess, I'm surprised at the magnitude. I know the U.S. dollar has strengthened a lot. But just given the fact that you have local debt in a lot of these markets helping to offset some of the impact, I guess, I'm surprised at the magnitude of you really saying in FX is a $0.05 hit.","Arthur William Stein","I'll start with the FX, Michael. I think there must have been a misinterpretation there. So the FX is, I think, probably $0.01 hit at most, maybe $0.02. In terms of the -- what was the question on the -- oh, capitalization. So a little additional clarification on the capitalization. So we had -- and previously, we had been expensing all capital expenditures of $10,000 or less. And today, we are capitalizing what's appropriate to capitalize down to any amount, which is really consistent with GAAP. The $10,000 and lower policy, I think, was more or less a holdover from our IPO days. $10,000 was a holdover from our IPO days when we had limited resources and there was a question of our ability to track, from a capitalization standpoint, expenditures of $10,000 or less. And we just -- honestly, we didn't consider $0.01 in the first quarter to be particularly material.","Michael F. Foust","That's really to bring ourselves in line with GAAP and what we see as the capitalization policies of most of our peers and other companies. But we're still being fairly conservative.","Arthur William Stein","Yes. I mean, the other change on operating expenses, we were -- we started to expense operating expenses, recognize expenses prior to the cessation of the capitalization of interest, which is obviously not consistent. So now the operating expenses and the capitalization of interest line up. And the split between those 2 was roughly 50-50 in terms of effect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So Mike, in your prepared comments, I know you talked about delayed leasing commencements over the course of between now and, I think, through 2018. You don't have to go through those again, but maybe if you could break them down between stabilized assets, what's under construction and what needs to be started from a development perspective to deliver on those leases.","Michael F. Foust","Yes. Well, generally, I wasn't speaking anything beyond 2013. So I wasn't projecting out beyond this year. So I do want to make that clear. And really the timing is not around so much around construction in most markets. It's because we're continuing to deliver data center inventory where we need it, both Powered Base Building and Turn-Key, and we can build a Powered Base Building very rapidly. So it's really the timing, which I wouldn't say timing is longer, but we're still seeing pretty elongated discussions and planning with our larger customers. And that's one of the reasons why we also want to focus, in addition, on middle-market customers, where we might be able to move more rapidly and smooth out the lumpiness of our signings and commencements. And the other thing, these transactions just don't follow hard-and-fast quarter-by-quarter rules. They take the amount of time that the customer needs. So they're not really focused on quarterly completions themselves. So you'll get these different deals extending as long as we need to make sure that the customer is getting the right solution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, I just want to clarify, Bill. So it sounds like you're having better leasing signings, but the commencements are a bit delayed. So the fact that guidance went up, I just want to be clear, that's really all due to the capitalization policy change and not due to faster leasing? And then secondly, you mentioned that tenants were taking space in some of the outyears, but I was surprised that tenants were committing to space to '16, '17 and '18. And I'm just trying to understand the thought process behind, I guess, the tenant committing to space effectively 5 years out and your committing to space 5 years out.","Arthur William Stein","So the answer to the second question, Steve, is that we have a build-to-suit one deal that has some long pickups, if you will, where we're delivering space in the outyears.","Michael F. Foust","And very big.","Arthur William Stein","Yes, it's a very large deal. And answer to the first question is yes. The -- about a $0.05. There's $0.05 in the forecast that's related to the change in accounting policy. And commencements, as Mike said, have been delayed, which affects revenue recognition and acquisition. And that would drive the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just a follow-up on the offsets. Were there any other offsets to the capitalization change, policy change other than the FX?","Arthur William Stein","I mean, there are ins and outs, Jonathan, that we would expect to -- the G&A might come in a little bit lower. OpEx might come in a little bit lower. But it's no more than $0.01 or $0.02 around the edges.","Michael F. Foust","And I think looking at our overall guidance and projections, on the high end, we think we have an opportunity to achieve additional leasing, as well as additional operational efficiencies. So we're now looking entirely at capitalization policy as driving what we think could be our higher end of our range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just one quick follow-up around development. The guidance is for $980 million of development deliveries. From the supplemental, you can get a sense of, you've done about 400 square feet of deliveries year-to-date. But we don't really have a dollar value behind that. Could you give us a sense of how much dollar-wise you've delivered and how much is still to go and where that additional development deliveries meant to come from the CIP [ph] pipeline?","Michael F. Foust","I don't know if we have the dollar amount available.","Arthur William Stein","We'd have to get back to you on that.","Michael F. Foust","Yes. I mean, we have how much we spent. But you can see on Page 30 of the supplemental, the construction in progress by market breaks down the relative amount of activity in the different markets.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. But which of these pieces are delivering in 2013 as part of your overall guidance?","Michael F. Foust","I think, overall, we're delivering about a total of them of 1 million square feet, a little more than that.","Arthur William Stein","A lot of the capital deliveries is back end-weighted in the year, Tayo. That's when the project completions are.","Michael F. Foust","And when we're building out the Turn-Key components.","Operator","That does conclude the allotted time for our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to the speakers for closing remarks.","Michael F. Foust","Thank you for your time, everyone, and your attention to the company, much appreciated.

I would first like to thank everyone who participated in our Analyst Day two weeks ago. We greatly appreciate your interest and all the positive feedback we received since that event.","I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with a few comments on our sector, a brief summary on our 2012 operations, as well as our progress to-date in 2013. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our fourth quarter, as well as our first year 2012 financial results, and we will address some of the questions we\u2019ve received since Investor Day with respect to our 2013 guidance. Following his remarks we will open the call to your questions.","Much has changed in our sector since Digital became the first datacenter REIT in 2004. Today there are four datacenter REITs with different backgrounds, management teams, design philosophies, growth strategies and claims of competitive advantages.","It is clearly an exciting sector with attractive growth prospects, but also one that requires a high level expertise around operations, innovative engineering, design and construction, finance, as well as acquisitions and investment management. Digital Realty is well-positioned with deep professional resources in all of these areas.","As we indicated in our -- at our event last month we finished 2012 with a solid performance and we are very encouraged by the level of activity going into 2013. Types in the year include, first, an exceptional 22% growth in adjusted EBITDA over fiscal year 2011.","Secondly, strong and consistent EBITDA margins of approximately 70% adjusted for transaction expenses and utility reimbursements.","Furthermore, we have record high leasing commencements of $135 million of annualized GAAP revenue and acquisitions of US$1.6 billion. In addition, we have record first quarter leases signed to date in Q1 2013 representing $31.4 million of annual GAAP rent revenues.","Let me turn first to our leasing activity, the record level of commencements in the fourth quarter of 2012 drove our strongest annual performance to date totaling $135 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue, up 36% from 2011.","Since Analyst Day I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve signed additional leases totaling $13.4 million, bringing total lease signings for the first quarter to date to $31.4 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue.","This compares favorably to nearly $18 million of lease signings for the entire first quarter of 2012 and nearly $19 million for the first quarter of 2011. In fact, we are on track to exceed 2012\u2019s highest quarter for lease signings of $32.2 million.","The additional signings increased our backlog to $99.5 million of annualized GAAP rent, of which $61.6 million is expected to commence in 2013, $20.4 million expected to commence in 2014 and 2015 timeframe, $17.5 million expected to commence between 2016 and 2018. We are very encouraged by our progress so early in the year.","Enterprise customers appear to be moving ahead with their new datacenter requirements as our cloud and managed services providers. Furthermore, we are seeing this activity across our portfolio including Phoenix, New Jersey, Aspen, Virginia, London and Sydney from industry verticals including financial services, social media, Internet enterprises and managed hosting cloud providers.","We continue to track approximately 1.9 million square feet of demand for new facilities. This consistent demand represents prospects in our sales funnel to which we\u2019ve made proposals that we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing. For detailed supply and demand information on our major investment market, please see the appendix section of our Analyst Day presentation, which is posted on our website.","Turning now to our 2012 lease renewal activity, during the year we signed approximately 621,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex in Powered Based Buildings space at renewal rates that increased 9.3% on a GAAP basis and decreased slightly 3.7% on a first year GAAP basis.","This includes over 212,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate of $165 per square foot, up 5.2% on a GAAP basis and down 6.4% on a cash basis in the quarter.","In addition, we renewed a large amount of Powered Based Buildings space over 408,000 feet, that\u2019s up 20.3% on a GAAP basis and up 3.4% on a first year cash basis. The combined average retention rate for datacenter space for the year was over 84%.","On a square foot basis 74% of Turn-Key space or 82% of GAAP rent renewed on an average term of nearly 90 months. We also renews 90% of expiring Powered Based Building, quietly 106% of GAAP rent and an average lease term of over 105 months.","The healthy length of renewals along with the annual 2.5% to 3% contractual increases allows us to recapture any declines in cash rents after year three of the new lease term on average with continuously growing cash flow thereafter.","Last month we presented estimated mark-to-market annual GAAP rental rate increases on datacenter renewals and re-leasing of increased considerably 5% to 10% expected for 2013 to 2015. On a cash basis over that same period, we are projecting the first year cash rental renewals to decrease slightly by 3% from relatively high expiring rents.","As further evidence of the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, occupancy increased in the second quarter in a row to $94.4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to 92 -- [94.2%] in the third quarter. The increase was driven by the addition of over 165,000 square feet of space that was leased from our existing operating portfolio.","Secondly, the acquisition of two 100% occupied properties and commencement leases totaling nearly 187,000 square feet from our development program. These additions were partially offset by new available datacenter space converted from our development program and lease expirations noted above.","Turning now to our acquisitions program, we completed over $1.6 billion of strategic acquisitions in 2012 another record high for the company. Our acquisition programs remains very important component of our growth strategy and accounted for approximately 57% of our NOI growth in 2012.","Included in that figure are the Bouygues Telecom sale leaseback properties located outside of Paris, therefore we acquired in the fourth quarter for US$79 million. Bouygues Telecom is a BBB+ rated wireless telecom provider in France and the three properties are mission critical to their operations.","We expect to see more sale leaseback opportunities in 2013 reflecting part of the growing outsourcing trend. The blended going in unlevered cash cap rate for the fourth quarter acquisitions consisting of the Bouygues Telecom sale leaseback properties and the single-tenant Sydney property, this unlevered cash cap rate was slightly over 9%.","So far in 2013 we have completed two acquisitions totaling $32.5 million. The first property is an operating datacenter totaling 61,750 square feet located in Dallas, Texas area, approximately 3.5 miles from our Digital datacenter campus in Richardson. The single tenant facility is leased on a long-term basis to a leading provider of business, information technology and communication solutions.","The second property is located in Phoenix, Arizona and consists of -- actually in the Chandler market and consists of three buildings totaling approximately 227,000 square feet.","The first building, which totals above 109,000 square feet will be added to Digital Realty\u2019s inventory of space held for development and is capable of supporting initially 7.2 megawatts of IT capacity.","So our current tenant occupies the remaining two office buildings on a short-term basis offsetting the near-term carrying cost for the property. Significant additional datacenter development is possible on this property and the site provides added future inventory to the Phoenix market where we\u2019ve experienced significant absorption at our existing facilities, along with continued strong demand from enterprise customers in particular.","We remain committed to maintaining our dominant position as the market consolidator. We have an extensive pipeline of prospects for acquisition totaling almost $1 billion. These prospects include high quality stabilized properties, value add opportunities, ground up development sites, as well as sale leaseback transactions.","Finally, I will briefly review our development program. In addition to inventory through our acquisitions, we continue to ramp up construction to add [Flex] markets to meet current demand.","Current development activity includes nearly 460,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex space that is 21% pre-leased, over a 153,000 square feet of custom solution space that is 100% pre-leased and approximately 760,000 square feet of Powered Base Buildings space for future inventory in key markets. Detailed information on our development activity by market can be found on page 29 of our fourth quarter supplemental package.","As stated in our 2013 guidance, we plan to invest somewhere between $850 million and $950 million in new construction this year, the largest amount in our history. We believe that our scale and improving development program combined with our disciplined investment management approach and our superior balance sheet allow us to better manage market risk by diversifying our capital deployment across geographies and product types, while achieving unmatched returns on invested capital.","We have a great deal to be optimistic about in 2013. In addition to our outstanding team of dedicate real estate financial and technical professionals, we\u2019ve added significant new talent in key positions within the organization.","Because of our global platform, financial resources and dominant position in industry that has tremendous growth prospects we are fortunate -- we are in a very fortunate position to continue to track and retain professionals that we consider among the best in the business.","We believe that our commitment to excellence and innovation, delivering superior datacenter solutions to our customers will continue to drive solid earnings growth for our shareholders.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I will keep my remarks brief and focus primarily on fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and elaborate on 2013 guidance.","As Mike indicated in his comments, 2012 was another year of exceptional performance for Digital. As a result on Tuesday our Board approved a quarterly common stock dividend increase of 6.8% or $0.05 a share to $0.78 per share.","This is our 11th dividend increase in a little over eight years since our 2004 IPO and reflects the quality of our earnings and optimism for continued growth. Since our first full quarter of operations in 2005, we have grown our dividend by a compounded annual growth rate of over 15%.","In 2012, we raised over $2.4 billion of new capital. Our balance sheet strength combined with our excellent lender and investor relationships continued to provide access to multiple capital sources globally to fund the growth of our company. For example, last month we were the first U.S. REIT to access the sterling bond market with a 400 million sterling 12-year unsecured note offering at a coupon of 4.25%.","Proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the global revolving credit facility drawn to fund the Sentrum acquisition and to further hedge our FX exposure to foreign markets. This transaction is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk by lengthening our maturities at attractive rates.","Currently, we have $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $48.5 million in short-term investments plus funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity we\u2019re fully utilized we would remain in compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, term loan, prudential shelf facility and other unsecured debt.","In 2013, we have $228 million remaining principal amortization and debt maturities with a weighted average cost of 6%. We plan to retire initially with the revolver and eventually replace with additional long-term unsecured debt and\/or preferred stock.","For the full year 2012, we sold approximately 957,000 shares of common stock through our at-the-Market equity distribution program for net proceeds totaling $62.7 million at an average price of $66.19 per share and currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program.","Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today\u2019s earnings release, the fourth quarter FFO per share was $1.16. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, fourth quarter 2012 core FFO was $4.1 million higher than reported FFO or a $1.19 per share. This reflects a 15.5% increase from the fourth quarter 2011 core FFO of a $1.03 per share.","The non-core expenses of transaction expenses are largely due to our recent acquisitions in Paris and Sydney. These expenses were partially offset by a change in fair value of contingent consideration related to the Sentrum portfolio that was recorded as a reduction to rental property operating expenses, accounts payable and other liabilities. A fair value assessment on the three-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required for each reporting period. Changes in fair value are considered non-core adjustments.","For the full year 2012, FFO per share was $4.44, up over 9% from 2011 FFO per share of $4.06. When adjusting for non-core items, 2012 core FFO per share was $4.46, up 9% from 2011 core FFO per share of $4.09.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the fourth quarter of 2012, was $115.8 million, up from $115.6 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 82.6%, unchanged from last quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA, at quarter-end of $204 million grew by 25% from $163.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and by 2% from $205.5 million last quarter, excluding transaction cost, adjusted EBITDA grew by 27.5% and 4.1% respectively. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.2 times at quarter-end, up from five times last quarter, which is mostly due to higher transaction cost in the period, as well as a higher drawn balance on our global revolving credit facility at year end.","The ratio is within our new guideline of maintaining debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times up from five times. This increase in debt capacity is in line with our BBB, Baa2 investment grade ratings and was discussed with the rating agencies at our recent annual meetings.","The higher balance decreased our weighted average cost of debt to 4.25% at quarter-end from 4.35% last quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was 3.8 times compared to the previous quarter of 3.7 times. For the full year adjusted EBITDA was $758.7 million in 2012, up 22% year-over-year from $622.9 million in 2011.","As disclosed in our Analyst Day presentation, at the midpoint of our 2013 guidance, we forecast 17% growth in 2013 adjusted EBITDA of $891 million versus 2012 adjusted EBITDA of $759 million, up slightly from the midpoint estimate of $757 million disclosed at that event. Based on the information, we provided on page 74 of our annual state presentation entitled \u2018return on strategic capital investment,\u2019 we expect incremental revenue in 2013 to be 47% of stabilized revenue, which implies commencements are mostly back-end weighted in the year, slightly back-end weighted, excuse me, modestly.","Turning to the income statement, net operating income increased to $219.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up $7.8 million or 3.7% from $211.8 million last quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to growth provided by incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions which was partially offset by unreimbursed landlord costs related to Hurricane Sandy and an increase in property taxes and $1.6 million special reserve relating to one tenant which affected rental revenue.","Tenant reimbursements decreased by $3.8 million to $75.1 million in the fourth quarter from $78.9 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to seasonal fluctuations in utility expenses. Property taxes increased by $1.7 million to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter from $18 million in the third quarter due to supplemental taxes resulting primarily from reassessments of completed developments in Singapore and one U.S. property.","NOI margins including utility reimbursements decreased 120 basis points in the fourth quarter versus third quarter due to the previously discussed increase in property taxes as well as unreimbursed Sandy-related landlord costs. NOI margins including utility reimbursements increased slightly in the (inaudible) quarter versus third quarter due to lower utility reimbursements in the period as previously mentioned.","We prefer to look at NOI margin and EBITDA margin excluding utility reimbursements because of the seasonal fluctuation that occurs in a given calendar year in utility expenses. Likewise, fourth quarter same-store NOI was relatively unchanged at $181 million compared to $181.4 million in the previous quarter.","Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments was $163.3 million in the (inaudible), also relatively unchanged from $161.7 million in the third quarter. This nominal decrease quarter-over-quarter was largely due to Sandy and the tax assessments we mentioned.","It is important to know that combined with the late rating of lease commencements in the quarter i.e. December, approximately 73% of fourth quarter commencements occurred at new properties and are not included in the same store pool.","G&A decreased (inaudible) to $13.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14.4 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to year end accrual adjustments. Transaction expenses increased to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $504,000 last quarter due to costs incurred in connection with the recent international acquisitions activity previously mentioned.","Interest expense decreased to $40.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $41 million last quarter. Although gross interest increased in the quarter due to additional borrowings, we capitalized $3.4 million of more interest in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter primarily due to the inclusion of additional qualified activity in our unconsolidated joint ventures and pre-purchases of heavy equipment as well as higher construction in our portfolio. Going forward, we expect capitalized interest to normalize around $5 million per quarter.","Finally, we are confirming our 2013 FFO guidance of $4.65 to $4.80 per share and our 2013 core FFO guidance range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share that we announced at our January 31, Analyst Day with the assumptions that were set fourth in the press release.","In response to (inaudible) that we\u2019ve received regarding our 2013 guidance assumptions, we would like to provide some additional color on the expected ROI or return on investment, up 10% to 12% on a $986 million of datacenter capital that we expect to deliver in 2013. And that range compares to our stated targeted returns of 11% to 14%.","There are two important factors that (inaudible) expected return of 10% to 12%. First, the low-end of the 10% to 12% ROI range reflects the potential lag associated with the timing of lease commencements. By comparison, the 11% to 14% range is based on stabilized cash NOI.","For signings in 2011 and 2012, we achieved unlevered cash returns of 12.3% and 12.2% respectively. We expect to deliver returns on a stabilized cash basis in line with historical performance.","Second, based on the three-year earnout agreement associated with the Sentrum acquisition, there is a cap 9% return on leases signed at the Woking property that we estimate will lower 2013 lease of returns by 50 basis points. As it is customary, we will revisit our guidance assumptions each quarter and revise them as necessary.","This concludes our formal remarks and (inaudible) now open the call to your questions. Operator?","Question-and-answer Session","Operator","(Operator instruction) And your question will come from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about lease pricing and the leasing spreads you are seeing across the different property types. And if you can -- if you think the guidance you gave, how does it break out across the different types of properties?","Mike Foust","","Well, we kind of tend to look across the Turn-Key Flex and the powered base buildings. And the powered base building renewals tend to -- and I think as we mentioned as, we talk about renewal activities those generally are up probably around 10% on a GAAP basis and 3% or 4% on a cash basis.","Generally, when I think on the Turn-Key Flex, our experience has been those increase on a GAAP basis a little over 5% and last quarter they were down 6%. But I think we are generally seeing that they\u2019d be down on a first-year cash basis on average more like 3% going forward on the Turn-Key Flex.","So overall we are looking at projecting somewhere in kind of the high single-digits to 10% on a GAAP basis going forward and on that first year and on the first year of cash, about 3% overall.","Operator","Your next question will come from Schildkraut with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just kind of following-up on some stuff that came to us this morning. I had a question about the capitalized lease commissions. Just wondering the terms of the timing, do you pay those out when the leases are commenced or at the time that you sign leases? Thanks.","Bill Stein","Half on signing and half on commencement.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Your next question will come from George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","Great. Thanks. Mike, could you give us some color on the leasing pipeline? I know you\u2019ve had some success here in the first quarter, but maybe help us understand what the pipeline looks like going forward?","And of the $31 million of leases that were signed so far in the first quarter, how much of that would you say was business that you may have thought was going to close in the fourth quarter kind of drifted into the first quarter? And how much of it -- do you think it sort of represents maybe an acceleration of kind of ongoing demand?","Mike Foust","Sure. I think probably, I don\u2019t know $5 million or $6 million of revenue was items that drifted. I think from fourth quarter to first quarter and the remainder, things that were closing in the kind of the natural course of business. So, overall, we are very encouraged by the amount of leasing activity and it includes enterprises, financial services, our cloud and managed service providers, even some of the large social networking and Internet commerce companies. So we are seeing a really good general [growth] in demand. And I think the trend for outsourcing of enterprises is definitely driving that continued trend upward and signings this quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup","Just going back to the TIs and leasing commissions for a second. They looked particularly high, especially in the renewal portfolio. I was wondering, what would make them jump up so much over on your recent run rate?","Mike Foust","Emmanuel, there was one deal in particular that involved a tenant in a high-rise building. It was an anchor tenant and it involved not only a renewal but a relocation. They were in two different locations in the building. So one was an eight floor location and one was a second floor location.","So the second floor suite was located adjacent to the eight floor, and there was also expansion associated with that. And just because of the nature of the building, it was very expensive to relocate them. And I guess, additionally, this is a tenant that we would hope to do additional business with on a global basis support. It\u2019s a strategic customer for us.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, out there. Just wanted to circle back, Bill, to -- you gave some color that was helpful on the G&A change sequentially and the capitalized interest. But if you could flesh those out a little bit more for us? It sounded like G&A was down because of reversal of accruals, just the source of that.","And then on the cap interest, I think you said -- it seemed like a very big spike to me and up $3 million to $4 million given that your average borrowing cost has come down. It seems like a lot of money would have to -- a lot of additional investment would be capital. If you could walk us through the mechanics of those two, that would be helpful?","Bill Stein","Sure. So in the case of the G&A, that was predominantly a reversal in the bonus accrual for the year because we didn\u2019t make the high end of its internal targets and that\u2019s what accounted for that.","In the case of the capitalized interest, there is a catch-up associated with this and there\u2019s new methodology as well. But as a result there was a $3.5 million catch-up, as I said it would normalize at around $5 million going forward.","Operator","Your next question will come from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead with your question.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi. Thanks. Just a question around your development costs. It appears that some of the estimates went up in the quarter on a sequential basis. Just give us a little bit of detail as to what\u2019s driving this and if you are expecting any yield impacts or was that all sort of pass-through costs at this point?","Mike Foust","Well, our development costs are going up actually as a result of more projects. So on a unit basis actually, Jim Smith, and our team have really driven down unit costs on per KW per square foot. So the increase in the amount of construction we are doing and our guidance is a direct result of taking advantage of more opportunities that we are seeing in the market around the U.S., around the globe. So it\u2019s (inaudible), so we are building more.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC","Yeah. I was interested in the revenues that you classified as retail, and what types of returns you are seeing on those deals versus the rest of the business. Is this retail kind of captive business that you are winning from your existing wholesale customers or given that there is a broader set of competitors like Telex and Equinix competing for the business, is it kind of a different dynamic? If you could maybe flush that out a bit that would be helpful.","Mike Foust","Those are our small footprint customers where we are just designating. And maybe big companies with a small footprint requirement and it might be an existing customer that has a smaller requirement in a particular geographic market and that\u2019s where (inaudible) program really comes into play, to be able to serve that broad range of customers.","And so we are really focused on expanding those opportunities, (inaudible) our customer base broadly. So that\u2019s and we are pretty -- we are very bullish actually on being able to increase that opportunity. So we can capture the broad range. Our returns are probably somewhat higher than on our larger footprint leases. If you look at unlevered return on costs, we are clearly on a higher returns. So we like that business all around.","Operator","Your next question will come from Dave Rodgers with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Hey, good morning. And maybe a follow-up to John\u2019s, on the colo business. The occupancy at 365 Main sell in the quarter, should there be any particular read through on what you might want to do with that space internally? And then along the colo line, do you have any earmarked money in either acquisitions or development CapEx this year kind of geared towards that retail colo business?","Mike Foust","Yeah. So at 365 Main that was just -- we just built out more space in that building. So, we\u2019re taking advantage of the opportunity to add values. So our folks are really clever and creative and we\u2019ve been able to capture space. Add our UPS power and be able to expand there and certainly we\u2019re deploying a significant amount of capital either directly to building out that colo business if you will. I don\u2019t have it at my fingertips, but significant portion of our $850 million to $950 million projected CapEx for this year is devoted toward adding value at our assets with the colo program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with the question.","Mitch Germain - JMP Securities","Good morning, guys. Just interested, Mike or Bill, in terms of allocating capital outside of the U.S. Seems like you kind of fall in Europe, is the goal is sort of beef up your Asia Pac exposures at this point?","Mike Foust","We\u2019re looking -- we\u2019re definitely looking at opportunities both in Europe as well as Asia Pac. And we\u2019re at a point now in Europe where we\u2019re pursuing a couple of opportunities on the continent to add to our portfolio. So while the capital spending actually, I think is probably going to go up a little bit as a percentage in Europe.","Right now, we are projecting about 9% of our CapEx spend to be in Europe and the CapEx spend in Asia Pac was probably mostly due to the timing going down from 21% of the total bucket to 16%. But the bucket has grown also. So you are probably looking at almost the same amount in terms of dollar investment.","Bill Stein","Yeah. Asia is (inaudible) on an absolute dollar basis and Europe was up I think by about a third in absolute dollars.","Operator","Next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Rob Stevenson - Macquarie","Hello, guys. Just a sort of follow-up on that. Can you contrast the U.S., Europe and Asia and your sort of core markets for us both in terms of the ability to drive cash rents where you see the best pricing power and where it\u2019s sort of lagging at this point? And then, what you are seeing in terms of acquisition cap rates in those three regions for core income producing assets?","Mike Foust","Well, in terms of income producing assets, we are projecting I believe in our guidance 7% to 8% roughly.","Bill Stein","7.25% to 7.75%.","Mike Foust","And we were able to achieve somewhat over 9% in the fourth quarter with a combination of Sydney deal and a Paris deal. So we think that our guidance numbers are conservative. But there\u2019s going to be a range there and clearly it\u2019s averaging somewhere between that 7.25% and 7.75%. It\u2019s hard to make a sweeping statement about regions like that because every market in the U.S. has different characteristics and as well as in Asia-Pac as well as in Europe. A lot has to depend with (inaudible) are. I think it\u2019s safe to say that generally for investment properties across the board, cap rates have declined over the last couple of years.","For datacenter buildings, we are not seeing a rapid decline for the properties we are looking up. And also there is properties that trade at 6% to 6.5% that we just don\u2019t bid on it. There is a property - a couple of things that we\u2019ve taken a look at in Europe that have been potentially 5.5% to 6%. So we are looking for those opportunities where we can either create value or be in a position to underwrite tenants in buildings and releasing risk that other core investors are going to have a difficult time doing.","In terms of lease rates, we are generally seeing lease rates have stabilized in most markets in the U.S. and they\u2019ve been flat, pretty flat year-over-year, that we did have an uptick in the fourth quarter of 2012 that was encouraging. And broadly, every market is a little different in Europe and Asia-Pac. Europe is pretty steady at rates that have declined.","I would say London is pretty steady. Paris doesn\u2019t have a lot of activity right now. Amsterdam will continue to be a healthy market. And we are still seeing a good activity in London. So, I think flat rates would probably be the norm. In Asia Pac, lease rates are very healthy, demand is healthy generally and we see really good pricing power in the Asia Pac markets.","Bill Stein","And, Rob, one thing I would like to add to that is that in Europe on the acquisition side, there are situations where the seller of the asset is seeking liquidity and there is limited liquidity in Europe today. So in those situations, we can really achieve a pretty attractive risk adjusted return.","Operator","Your next question will come from Tayo Okusanya with Jeffries. Please go ahead with your question.","Tayo Okusanya - Jeffries","Yeah. Good afternoon. So just a quick question in regards to deferred rents. Just when I look at the growth on that line item relative to how much rent has been growing, it seems like deferred rent has been growing a little bit faster over the past few quarters. I was wondering whether you could address that.","Bill Stein","We bought a pretty large portfolio in July, which was the Sentrum Portfolio, and that would account for a significant component of that. It was US$1.1 billion, Tayo.","Operator","Your next question will come from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Hi guys. Mike, a couple of your tenants focused over in the ISP in cloud arena had a rough week in the stock market mainly Rackspace, CenturyLink, and Level 3. I\u2019m just curious as you look at the way the market responded to what those companies had to say, I don\u2019t know if you had a chance to look at what they said to the market. But what was your read on how their businesses are doing and what you think that foretells in terms of the space that they are going to be demanding going forward from companies like they did?","Mike Foust","That\u2019s a really good question and actually we\u2019re seeing both of those companies in particular continue to see good demand and very good growth. It seems like the market did not like CenturyLink\u2019s decision to use cash flow and to shift that cash flow from dividends to stock repurchase.","I think that in my opinion had a very, very big effect on their stock rather than our operating results. If you look at CenturyLink\u2019s enterprise market both network and enterprise market data hosting which are our tenants, that would be your -- generally your Savvis and your historic Qwest. Operating revenues in their hosting business was up almost 13% year-over-year on the quarter.","Colocation revenues were up almost 10%. They are seeing quite a bit of increase in their geographic expansion including and expanding further into Germany and they have got adding to their portfolio of cloud services. So it\u2019s a very attractive growing business which is why CenturyLink brought them on onboard.","The enterprise network market, those revenues were up almost 6% quarter-over-quarter to $671 million. Their other revenue is up 4.5% year-over-year. So that business is showing good growth too. Those are the businesses that would -- that do occupy and continue to take more space in our facilities.","If you look at CenturyLink overall, they have operating cash flow of U.S. $7.7 billion and in the quarter it was up -- it was $1.9 billion, which was an increase year-over-year before and net income was up. So their business overall and cash flow from operations and those sorts of health metrics look good and as I said that the enterprise hosting and enterprise network are doing quite well.","Rackspace, it appears the market didn\u2019t like that. They only grew 57% quarter-over-quarter instead of 65% quarter-over-quarter revenues. So their revenues and new business is still growing tremendously well. And they need more space in many markets. So I think a natural adjustment and sometimes when stocks get a little frothy on valuations, but their business is extremely healthy and growing.","Operator","Next question will come from John Stewart with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","On the TI, on the Turn-Key Flex renewals, first of all, can you tell us which market that was. Secondly, is it fair to assume, call it a 65% NOI margin so, a $100 rent. And then lastly can you tell us what the book value per square foot was before you capitalized the additional $130 a square foot in leasing costs?","Mike Foust","John, your question was cut off. We didn\u2019t hear all of it.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors","I asked which market the Turn-Key renewal space was in. Is it fair to assume a $100 net rent and what was the existing book value per square-foot before you capitalized on a $130 of additional leasing cost?","Bill Stein","We don\u2019t have the book value for you in Chicago. We don\u2019t have the other information for you right now. We can talk about that offline.","Operator","Your next question will come from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","\u2026.specifically, it sounded like you are seeing some pretty good demand there and recently bought another portfolio of office buildings to get the inventory. Can you just talk about what verticals are really -- you\u2019re seeing strength there and what the sweet spot is for deal sizes?","Mike Foust","I\u2019m sorry, Vincent, the first part of your question didn\u2019t come through.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","I was just wondering about Phoenix. It sounded like you had some positive comments there, and recently added some more inventory. Just trying to get a sense of what the demand looks like, where the strength is coming from in terms of industry verticals. Also, what is the sweet spot in terms of size of deployment that you\u2019re seeing demand for there?","Mike Foust","Phoenix is very active. We\u2019ve seen a wide range of large requirements, multiple megawatts, as well as growing smaller footprint requirements. And it\u2019s a combination of enterprise, web-based commerce, retail, hosting, managed services. So a pretty good mix of customers in Phoenix.","Phoenix has always been historically a very tech market, broad based datacenter market for enterprises and financial services companies. And we already have a big stable financial services companies in Phoenix and particularly in Chandler.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from (inaudible) Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on your conversations with the largest corporate enterprise users. I mean it seems like last year they have been -- they were in the pipeline, they are still in the pipeline. What changed for those guys after the first of the year. What do they need to see to really get more active here and just kind of how are they thinking about their needs going forward that if we do start to get a better economy here and more visibility on earnings that you will really start to see a pick up or maybe that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it?","Mike Foust","Well, I think in 2012, there is a lot of (inaudible) going on about outsourcing. And a lot of internal strategic planning around capital allocation in a lot of the big -- and in many, many big enterprises and especially in financial services. So I think our indications are that a lot of these plans have been formulated and they are ready to be implemented.","And we see almost across the board, the plans include outsourcing of new space and consolidation of space. And outsourcing that is more of a leasing model as opposed to build-and-own yourself model. And we think that\u2019s going to add significant new business in 2013 and 2014. So we are really encouraged by that. And I think financial services are going to lead the way in that.","Other verticals are already looking down hard at healthcare. I think it will be another vertical that we will see more business coming out of. Certainly, the cloud services, computing, managed services. They are already focused on outsourcing and I think that\u2019s a very positive trend for us all around.","Operator","Your next question is also a follow-up from George Auerbach with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your follow-up question at this time.","George Auerbach - ISI Group","Bill, thanks for the additional color on the development yields. I guess, I just -- I understood what they mean. So that the 10% to 12% is sort of the year one cash return, the 11% to 14% is the stabilized return. Then I guess just how should we think about the timeframe in your view to hit the 10% to 14%. Is that sort of six to eight quarter lease up?","Bill Stein","Okay. So the 10% to 12% would be taking all of the commencements over the course of the year and basically establishing a run rate on 12\/31, divided by investment capital deployed. And the 10% assumes that some of the investment capital doesn\u2019t lease. So that\u2019s the reason for the delta between 10% to 12%.","You can see the 12% is pretty close to what we achieved in 2011 and 2012 but in fact adjusting for the 50 basis point reduction due to the Sentrum earn out, the 9% -- you could argue that we are expecting to do better this year than we did in prior years. The 11% to 14% is where we expect yields to fall.","So some yields will be at 11%, some yields will be at 14% and some actually could be higher than 14% and in fact have been higher than 14% in prior years, particularly in Asia. So, the 11% to 14% is really a range of outcomes and it just so happens that our results as adjusting for the Sentrum earnout, the 12.5% is really an essence right in the middle of the 11% and 14%.","Operator","Your next question is also follow-up from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your follow-up at this time.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","I just want to circle back. There was some commentaries surrounding colocation and this was a discussion topic and point the colocation strategy at the Investor Day that I think it hit on. But you identified the firm\u2019s current markets as a broad swath including the major metros like New York and Boston, Northern Virginia, Chicago, et cetera.","I know colocation had -- you picked up this business through (inaudible) and you\u2019ve grown it in markets where some of your major tenants who are in the colo business haven\u2019t wanted to necessarily expand into such as Dallas for instance or certain buildings in Dallas if you will. How are you thinking about the business today. I mean, are you willing to put your own colocation business to the extent -- with an existing customer in buildings with existing tenants and essentially going head to head?","Mike Foust","Well, our colo offering does not include managed services. So, if they overlap, I think we see very little overlap because most of our folks -- colocation in our vernacular is just a small footprint. We\u2019ll provide the remote hands, the rack and stack, the cabling, these are normal typical datacenter services that we do for the large customers as well as small customers.","Actually we do more of that type of -- the large footprint customers than the small ones in reality and actuality. So, we don\u2019t see a big differentiation around our product type. We don\u2019t see a lot of overlap but we\u2019re going to go ahead and continue to work hard to fill our buildings and serve our customers who have a wide range of footprint requirements. But I think in actuality, there is not much overlap between our customers that are providing a broader set of managed services and interconnect network services offerings.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question for today and that will be coming from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead with your follow-up at this time.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC","The robust (inaudible) leasing year-to-date (inaudible), just wondering, if you can comment is that reflective of all three regions in terms of broader market trends or primarily U.S. centric?","Mike Foust","Well, we certainly have more markets in the U.S. So the U.S. is always going to drive more volume, but we\u2019ve also had success with significant lease requirements in London for a build-to-suit, in Singapore a smaller TK Flex requirement or an international bank. New York Metro was one of our larger Wall Street customers, some office space in Philadelphia.","So it\u2019s a pretty wide range of requirements. I think that\u2019s reflective of the amount of activity, leasing activity we\u2019re seeing across the board whether it\u2019s Singapore or Sydney or in Phoenix or Northern Virginia or Chicago. So it\u2019s Dallas -- I mean certainly all these markets, New Jersey, we are seeing good activity. So it\u2019s pretty broad based, which is great for us because we have stock customers -- customers who want to be in multiple markets with us. And we will be able to take advantage of that throughout the year as well.","Operator","And we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers for today. I would now like to turn the call over back to the management for any closing remarks at this time.","Mike Foust","Thank you. And thank you everyone for spending the time with us today on the call. As you can tell, we are very positive about the opportunities for our business and for our customers\u2019 business as well. The secular demand drivers that we reviewed on Investor Day continue to be in play and are only pointing towards greater demand as we had.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our fourth quarter results. First of all, we came in $0.04 ahead of the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range, driven by operational outperformance within both the legacy DFT and Digital Realty portfolios. Second, we've landed over 30 megawatts within the legacy DFT portfolio over the past five months, capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies in addition to hitting our expense synergy targets. Third, we expect to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin today on page two of our presentation with a recap of the principles that we laid out at our Investor Day in December. We've set ambitious growth targets over the next several years, and we expect to achieve them from a global connected sustainable framework.","What that really means is further leveraging our leading global platform to cross-sell, in addition to addressing new markets that meet our risk adjusted return criteria. Our top priority is deepening our connections with customers to position us to meet their needs and support their growth.","In addition, we are focused on further strengthening connections across the organization making sure that processes are streamlined, systems are integrated and people are performing efficiently. We are committed to sustainability and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees.","Let's turn to our recent investment activity on page 3. As you know, we entered Tokyo, a longtime target for us during the fourth quarter through a 50-50 joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. We contributed our recently completed project in Osaka, and Mitsubishi contributed two existing data centers in Tokyo. Japan is a highly strategic market and we see tremendous opportunity for growth over the next several years. We expect this joint venture will significantly enhance our ability to serve our customers' data center needs in Japan.","In particular, we expect that Mitsubishi's global brand recognition and local enterprise expertise will meaningfully improve our ability to penetrate local demand. We also closed on the acquisition of a data center in Chicago from a private REIT during the fourth quarter for $315 million. This value add-play offers a healthy going in yield along with shell capacity that gives us an opportunity to boost the unlevered return up into the high single-digits.","The investment represents an expansion in a core market and is occupied by existing Digital Realty customers with whom we had been independently working to meet their expansion requirements in Chicago.","Separately, we closed on the sale of two non-core assets at a 7.1% cap rate generating a little over $70 million in net proceeds. And we recognized gains of approximately $27 million during the fourth quarter. Since year-end, we've sold two more non-core assets generating net proceeds of a little less than $90 million and we expect to recognize gains of approximately $25 million during the first quarter. Since embarking on our capital recycling program a little over three years ago, we have now sold a total of 14 assets generating over $500 million of net proceeds and recognizing sizable gains in the process.","We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets. We believe that culling the asset base is prudent real estate portfolio management and we expect to generate up to another $100 million of proceeds from asset sales in 2018.","Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 4. Data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros, particularly in Northern Virginia. However, some context may be in order. It's helpful to remember that according to CBRE, the Northern Virginia data center inventory is larger than the total data center stock in any country in either Europe or Asia Pacific. As a result, while the absolute number of megawatts under construction may be big, we are very comfortable with our development exposure, as well as the pace of absorption in Northern Virginia, especially in the context of such a deep and active market with vacancy hovering in the low single digits. In fact, those of you who saw the Ashburn time lapse video at our Investor Day in December will be aware that we expect all the developable land in Loudoun County will be fully built out in the coming years. We believe our strategic landholdings represent a precious commodity and a key competitive advantage. Very few markets around the world operate at such a well-oiled cadence as Northern Virginia. For instance, there has been very limited inventory available in Silicon Valley for over a year, so recent leasing velocity has slowed considerably pending the arrival of new deliveries.","In Europe, demand is likewise robust, and 2017 was a record year for net absorption. Our participation was somewhat limited largely due to a lack of available inventory. We have recently brought capacity online in Amsterdam and London, and we expect to deliver additional capacity in the Frankfurt, London and Amsterdam in the first quarter to position us to capture a greater share of the strong current demand in Europe.","Across the Asia Pacific region demand remains robust, particularly from the global hyperscale players. The supply situation varies considerably by market. The local markets tend to be dominated by large telcos, and there's generally a shortage of institutional quality modern data center stock. The region is highly fragmented with very few pan-regional offerings. The limited available options for state-of-the-art carrier neutral facilities across multiple markets plays directly to our competitive advantages.","In addition to our deliveries, competitors are also bringing supply online to meet this demand, but the rapid pace of absorption is keeping vacancy rates below equilibrium in the single-digits. In sum, competition remains intense, particularly for larger requirements. And given the sector's recent history, any uptick in new supply bears careful watching. However, current vacancy rates are tight and we expect demand will continue to outstrip supply, while barriers to entry are beginning to emerge in select metros, which bodes well for long term rent growth, as well as the enduring value of infill portfolios such as ours.","Now let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The biggest change over the last 90 days has been tax reform. We expect minimal impact on our financials from the specific provisions of the tax reform bill, but we do believe it will be good for our customers businesses. And as a result, it should bode well for data center demand.","We saw very healthy growth from our customer base during the fourth quarter. The three leading cloud service providers each generated over $5 billion in cloud revenue during the fourth quarter alone, all growing at a very healthy clip well into the double digits.","The top seven cloud providers all generated over $1 billion of cloud revenue in the fourth quarter. This broad based growth plays directly to the strengths of our carrier neutral, cloud neutral platform. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that we would be offering private connections to the Oracle Cloud in 14 major metros and a total of 59 data centers through our Service Exchange. Similar to other leading cloud providers, Oracle maintains a significant presence in numerous locations across multiple regions within our global portfolio.","This recent announcement demonstrates the value proposition to our joint customers by giving them the ability to connect directly, privately and securely to a public cloud compute engine that sits right next to their private cloud environment within the same campus environment, reinforcing one of the key differentiators of our offering. The relevance of this capability was reinforced by the RightScale 2018 State of the Cloud Report published earlier this week, which found that on average companies are using about five public and private clouds. Separately, the Cisco Global Cloud Index forecasts that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021, and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021.","The opportunity to serve this rapidly growing segment of the market on a global scale meshes well with our competencies. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand set-up given our global platform, our comprehensive product offering, and our investment grade balance sheet.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the fourth quarter of $56 million including a $6 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $50 million during the fourth quarter, including a $9 million colocation contribution. The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the fourth quarter was approximately seven years.","Our fourth quarter wins continue to showcase the strengths of our global platform, as well as the demand for our multiproduct offering from both new digital economy customers, as well as more traditional enterprises. A leading Internet hyperscale user further expanded its footprint with us taking down another 12 megawatts in Ashburn and underscoring the value of the installed customer base and the relationships inherited through the DFT transaction.","We also won a sizable new logo deployment from a significant online multiplayer game creation platform further diversifying our customer base in Northern Virginia. Additionally, a primary global provider of financial market data and analytics grew with us in the tri-state area citing our operational effectiveness and our relationships with many of their subscribers.","Finally, not that all roads lead to Ashburn, but it's certainly been a lynchpin of our ability to sell to an international customer base across four global theaters. Ashburn twofers during the fourth quarter included an expansion with a large Chinese cloud service provider on our newest Ashburn campus. A top five cloud service provider expanded with us not just in Ashburn, but also in Sydney. And we also expanded a European SaaS provider in Sydney in addition to their inaugural deployment back in Ashburn. Combined colocation and connectivity signings rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. One of the world's largest telecommunications companies expanded in four locations across North America. A leading provider of integrated telecommunications services in Latin America expanded with us in one of our lower Manhattan Internet gateways demonstrating that the critical connectivity points in our portfolio will continue to drive regionally diverse demand.","Finally, on the enterprise front, one of America's oldest theater company selected Digital Realty as their trusted data center provider for all of their mission critical applications. Of the record 51 new logos added during the fourth quarter, nearly 19% were sourced through our North American and European colocation platforms, including 13 in Europe, likewise a regional high mark. Roughly half of these new logos were within the network sector, including a nationwide managed service provider, a cable provider and a computer software company; roughly half were enterprise, including an artificial intelligence platform, an online trading community, and a content provider.","The breadth and diversity of this new business should serve to drive new end users to the connectivity ecosystems and bodes well for future interconnection revenue growth given the historical correlation between new logos and interconnection bookings in subsequent periods. Our partners and alliance capabilities delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year of 2017, we achieved significant growth compared to the prior year due to the establishment of an alliance partner framework in addition to our focus and execution against our existing partner programs. We also provided our partners a set of standardized colocation and connectivity rate cards to make it easier for them to include us in their menu of services. These programs effectively extend our reach to serve enterprise customer demand for comprehensive solutions through various leading IT services, network and cloud service providers.","Through our recently announced partnership with Oracle, we've significantly expanded our customers' ability to connect to the Oracle Cloud through private dedicated access to Oracle Cloud infrastructure in 14 major metro areas and 59 Digital Realty data centers through our Connected Campus and Service Exchange interconnection platform. Through our continued partnership with IBM and leveraging Direct Link capabilities, we have been able to provide customers and IBM business partners direct access to the IBM Cloud in 20 data centers across nine global metros. These capabilities have allowed us to deploy a standardized hybrid colocation set of solutions sold with a direct dual fiber connection to the IBM Cloud platform that provides extremely low latency and highly secure access to the IBM Cloud.","As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliances programs to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect greater contributions in 2018. Our current partners and customers continue to see the value of our focus on working with quality solution and service providers to create a comprehensive IT solution offering and capabilities.","In terms of integration, we made significant progress over the past several months and we are nearing the finish line in many respects. As of year-end, all former DFT employees have been on boarded onto the Digital Realty benefits platform and we have finalized the HRIS and payroll system conversions.","At the property level, we completed the rebranding of all former DFT assets and we are wrapping up final security upgrades to bring all properties up to Digital Realty standards. We have completed alignment of onsite assets and equipment and we are finalizing the migration of the legacy DFT computerized maintenance management system onto our new platform.","The systems integration is progressing well and the migration of accounting, finance and HR-related applications have all been completed. We expect to finish the network integration in the second quarter of 2018. The marketing team completed the rebranding of all customer-facing collateral and transitioned the DFT digital and social properties to DLR. All the acquired properties are now showcased on our website and we've added material to conform to our corporate standards. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we still expect the vast majority of integration activities will be wrapped up by mid-year.","Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $116 million. The step up from $106 million last quarter reflects the $50 million of space and power leases signed, offset by $38 million of commencements and a $2 million delta due to the contribution of our recently completed development project in Osaka to the joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was eight months reflecting large leases signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we retained 76% of fourth quarter lease expirations and we signed $64 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 2.3% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across product types. We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio most notably within the former Dupont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash for leasing spreads for the full year in 2018.","On balance, however, we continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expiration. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points sequentially to 90.2% due to development projects placed in service in Ashburn and Dallas along with a churn event in Phoenix, where an IT systems integrator lost their end user customer contract and let their lease with us lapse their expiration. We do expect portfolio occupancy to dip below 90% in the first quarter of 2018 likewise due to a combination of development projects placed in service in Ashburn, Toronto, Silicon Valley and London, along with a churn event in Boston, where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint. Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a year ago, this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering.","However, we also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the fourth quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand, begin to rise during the fourth quarter as shown on page 10. We target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding and we were at 14% as of year-end. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 1% impact to our 2018 FFO per share.","In addition, although the 10-year benchmark may have backed up considerably over the past five months, our credit spreads have actually compressed meaningfully over the past two years as you can see depicted on the chart at the bottom of page 10. As a result, from an all-in cost of borrowing perspective, our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed.","Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share grew more than 8% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year of 2017, core FFO per share grew a little over 7% and came in $0.04 above the high end of our initial guidance range. Aside from updating the low end of the range for asset sales close to-date in the first quarter, our 2018 guidance is essentially unchanged from the initial outlook we rolled out just over a month ago.","In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first half of 2018 should represent approximately 48% of the full year results, while the second half should contribute roughly 52%. In other words, the fourth quarter should represent a pretty good run rate for the first half of the year with a step-up in the second half.","We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that recurring CapEx was up a little over $10 million sequentially during the fourth quarter. The biggest portion of the higher spend in the fourth quarter was one-time in nature related to value add activities at a non-core suburban office building in the Bay Area that was sold recently and this investment more than recouped. As a result, we now expect to deliver double digit AFFO per share growth in 2018.","In terms of the quarterly dividend, the distribution policy is ultimately a Board level decision. Given the low AFFO payout ratio along with the continued growth in our cash flows and taxable income, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004.","Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 12. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 6 times at the end of the third quarter to 5.2 times at year end and fixed charge coverage improved from just under 4 times in the third quarter to 4.2 times in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, leverage was somewhat overstated in the third quarter since all the debt related to the DuPont Fabros acquisition was on the balance sheet as of September 30, but the third quarter P&L included just a 17 day contribution from the DFT assets. We expect levers to gradually improve over the course of 2018 as the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized, and our cash flows continue to grow as signed leases commence throughout the year.","It's important to note that our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018, largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales Bill mentioned earlier. As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity.","As you can see from the chart on page 12, the weighted average maturity of our debt is approximately six years, and the weighted average coupon is just under 3.5%. Over 85% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a potentially rising rate environment. And nearly 100% percent of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling. A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a natural FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 12, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we would be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. My question, I wanted to harken back to the Investor Day commentary. Bill, you talked about the opportunity to take share on the leasing front going forward, recognizing that the market cap of DLR was larger in proportion relative to the leasing overall versus peers. And I just wonder a couple of months later if you could maybe take stock a little bit and talk about the measures you've implemented and what kind of progress you're making? And then maybe offer a little bit of context in terms of that progress around one of your large competitors, peers in the space coming into the hyperscale build business and one of the former CEOs announcing they're launching a new platform in the business?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Jordan. First of all, I assume you're referring to Tom Ray with your last point.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah, Tom Ray and Equinix.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Right.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Not too difficult.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","We have the highest regard for Tom, we welcome him back to the space. He is what I would call an absolutely rational competitor. I think, he's been a responsible steward of investors' capital and a great allocator of capital. So he's the type of person that we like to see coming into this space. But back to Investor Day, the steps that we outlined at that time were the executive sponsor program, a number of investments in customer success, as well as a streamlining of our underwriting and contract approval \u2013 contract negotiation process.","And I can tell you that during the fourth quarter, two-thirds of our fourth quarter wins involved an executive sponsor. So, I think that part of the program is working quite well. On the commercial side, the legal and commercial teams have worked very hard to put standard forms in place with quite a few of our customers, most of the major customers, and that's made it much easier to execute business with us, with very minimal additional negotiation. In fact 90% of the fourth quarter scale business was done with this type of arrangement in place.","So we're very encouraged by what I'd say are the early results, but we recognize that there's always room for improvement, but importantly, I think in terms of the benefits of doing business with Digital, clearly the global platform is quite important, anchored by irreplaceable gateways. We've got our comprehensive product offering from a single cabinet all the way up to hyperscale. And I think without \u2013 our investment grade balance sheet is without peer. And I think that's clearly very important in terms of minimizing counterparty risk for these firms that are signing up for long term with us to lease their mission critical facilities. So, I think this \u2013 once again this sets us up quite well for capturing what we think is going to be not only additional share, but a rising tide of demand in 2018.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then \u2013 it's helpful. And then as a follow-up maybe for Scott, I'd just be interested in his thoughts on the capital that seems to be cramming its way into this space. Your balance sheet is good for sure, but is there an opportunity beyond these non-core assets that you've sold to opportunistically monetize some of your stabilized assets, just seeing the multiples being paid in the high-20 times EBITDA or what have you for certain assets. Is there an opportunity here for Digital?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, Jordan, that's an interesting question and I do agree with you, there's sort of awful lot of capital coming in market, and clearly we're seeing some pretty big valuations out there. We're going to take a deep dive in our portfolio a little later this year and we're going to look at non-core assets, non-core markets, underperforming assets, assets which may become at risk for underperforming. But I think your point is good, and part of that would be looking at assets where essentially we've created all the value we can create and would it make more sense to redeploy that capital somewhere else in our portfolio. And as you know we've done that before with a joint venture that we put together with Pru several years ago. So, I think, it would be reasonable for us to bear that in mind as we review the portfolio later this year.","Operator","The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So following a bit on Scott's comment about valuations, I mean, the Infomart deal announced yesterday points to a pretty attractive cap rate, and I just wonder to what extent do you see that as being transferable to your Internet gateway assets? And anything you're seeing out there in terms of the valuations around regular turnkey product to be kind of interested in your perspective? Thanks.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. We think it's entirely applicable to the \u2013 to our Internet gateways. It's a \u2013 Infomart is a great asset, highly strategic, little more so for Equinix I think than others. And I think they are in a good position to add value there, but you're right, I mean, we can all kind of sort out what that multiple is there, and if you look at those multiples and apply that to our Internet gateways, I think, you're getting out some rather full valuations on that.","As it relates to other assets out there, we've seen a compression in cap rates. I mean, clearly the Infomart multiple relates to these kind of highly strategic Internet gateways, but we've seen cap rates in general come down and compress. There used to be a lot more differentiation across product types and \u2013 of assets and they're getting a lot closer. I think that bandwidth is maybe 100 basis points or 150 basis points wide, where it used to be more like 300 basis points wide for kind of the more traditional assets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's very helpful. And then with your major global peer kind of going hyper-scale, getting more into kind of wide area connectivity, I just sort of wanted to maybe get an update on the flip side in terms of your retail initiatives, Megaport partnership and anything else that is kind of worth highlighting that maybe Andy and Bill didn't capture in the scripts? Thanks.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jonathan. We're absolutely committed to the retail colo business. In the fourth quarter we had 51 new logos, fully 90% of those came through colocation, half from network and half from enterprise. And since we acquired Telx, we've doubled our megawatt capacity, committed to the colo product, we're up to 92 megawatts and that's both organically and through acquisitions. We plan to launch our colo business in Asia-Pac later this year. But I will say that we're definitely seeing a convergence of strategies and we can see that with the Equinix announcement today with customers and competitors recognize the value of interconnected scale, our offering of the full menu of options from a single rack to multiple megawatts along with the ability to connect directly, privately and securely from the enterprise customers' private cloud instance to a public cloud compute engine in order for there to be relevance to their hybrid cloud architecture. So, we think the colocation product is a very important element of our comprehensive product offering. And we're going to continue to invest in this business to support our customers' needs.","Operator","The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thank you. Two if I may. You did $199 million in annualized revenue in bookings or leasing in 2017 with two strong quarters in the last two quarters. Based on what you're seeing, well, I appreciate that bookings could jump quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter, I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the momentum that you're seeing and what your expectations are for 2018? Do you think you could be above the $199 million in 2018? And then secondly, CapEx when you gave your guidance earlier this year for the $900 million to $1.1 billion, that was meaningfully below what we were anticipating, that was already \u2013 and we had already been modelling something less than what if you just simply added DFT and DLR together. Can you just talk about your confidence that this is the right number of CapEx and the risk that we could find yourself in a year from now that you're undersupplied with inventory? Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Colby. This is Andy, I'll try to take the \u2013 start the first half of the first one, maybe add \u2013 Dan, chime in as well. So kind of just speaking to our most recent fourth quarter, overall we thought this is great results in terms overall robustness in volume, in terms of diversity by customer, geography and product line.","We had numerous customers expanding with us as you heard in the script, we had numerous customer signed in multiple geographic regions. Are \u2013 the biggest signing was into the legacy DFT portfolio, for all we made up about 25% of all the signings, so 75% of the signings were in legacy Digital portfolio, and as Bill just mentioned a second ago, 51 new logos which was a new record for us, so all in all great. I would say the trends we experienced in the fourth quarter seemed to be continuing into the beginning of the year, and I \u2013 we are certainly shooting for higher than $200 million of signings in 2018, albeit we're not providing any specific guidance on that line item. But I'll ask Dan if he has any other color on fourth quarter or our pipeline?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks Colby. Thanks Andy. So the fourth quarter and our positive feelings about the first quarter this time I don't think are any coincidence given the restructuring that we went through last year from a go-to-market perspective. We have a lot of things that play into our success, teams outside of the sales organization for sure. But in the second and third quarter, we went through a major restructuring, Colby, as you know and that all started to settle in, in the third quarter and we believe it started to pay some dividends for us in the fourth quarter. It's early in the first quarter. We are six weeks in; we feel positive about what we've done so far even with a very busy January with PTC and the sales kick off. And the pipeline that we see going into I'll say the rest of this quarter and into the second and maybe early into the third makes us feel positive and makes us feel very good. Of course, as I always like to say we have to execute against that pipeline, but we do feel like we're in a very good position.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And Colby back to your second question on capital. So when you do a deal with a company like DFT, I think, there are going to naturally be some capital synergies. You're not going to expand at the same sort of planned rate in certain \u2013 in identical markets, where if you had remained independent. So I think there is clearly some shrinkage of capital deployment from that standpoint. But when I look at our inventory, I think, it's \u2013 I think, we're in pretty good shape to be quite candid with you. And, frankly if we see additional demand in any of these markets, we'll add more capital. We'll tune it up. So we're pretty flexible in that area.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And just to round out your question on the CapEx, which was part 2. So, our midpoint of our guidance is about $1 billion, about $1.1 billion on the high end. I would say we as a team have certainly learned the lesson over the last handful of years of making sure inventory coming online and to make sure we have that fine balance especially in our core active development market. So our active pipeline has about 123 megawatts under construction, half of it leased, the other half available. And many of these markets be it like in Ashburn, we've delivered large shells and have had active signings into filling up our legacy campuses and into the latest buildings on our new campuses. So trying to obviously not overextend ourselves and put our balance sheet at risk, but not put us in a position where we're missing a good opportunity for one of our customers due to timing of inventory.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. A couple questions. First, you mentioned the idea of revisiting some of the portfolio for non-core assets. Is this the time \u2013 given where some of the strategic transactions have taken place on multiples and cap rates, is this the time to consider a more aggressive exploration of monetizing the power based buildings that would be very valuable to some of the tenants that sit inside of that. And then secondly, just curious as you talk about the competitive environment, if you could unpack maybe how the environment for pricing might be changing in 2018 versus 2017. And if you can put some context around the cash re-leasing spreads you saw in the fourth quarter on a cash basis relative to the guidance for slightly negative in 2018? Thanks.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Michael. It's Scott, I'll take the first half of that question, and I think that's an \u2013 it's an excellent question. I assume, you're saying on some of those PBBs perhaps, thinking about selling those to the customers that are in the building. Listen, I think everything is on the table. I will say the mitigating issues on that though typically are, what is the nature and design of the building and what market is it located in. Many of those still represent tremendous upside opportunity for us in the event, we were to get them back. Our basis is relatively low and they are extremely good investments for what they are, but in some cases, we could actually generate some pretty impressive returns if we got those back. So wouldn't want to forego future upside for the sake of a good cap rate today, but we'll keep that all in mind as we evaluate these opportunities.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And Michael, on the pricing and re-leasing question, I think, there was kind of two parts packaged in there. I guess, 2017 versus 2018 overall pricing, I mean, while we are in a competitive market for sure, we are seeing a tremendous amount of demand. So that intersection is kind of keeping pricing relatively intact with some exceptions to the positive, and the tight ends of the market build out in Santa Clara, where supply is still limited. On the re-leasing spreads, I mean, we've been coming through this kind of a journey where we've been bringing our re-leasing spreads further into the positive territory. This quarter was a positive outlier, positive across the major product sets, our colocation re-leasing spreads ticked up to 3.5%. We are positive on the TKF. Now, we do still have, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some above market leases in certain parts of the portfolio. Those are largely related to leases that were \u2013 came to us via one of our \u2013 the major acquisition last year with DFT. The timing of when those renew and the rates that they renew at obviously would put \u2013 could put a negative into those stats in any given quarter. But by and large, we see it slightly negative for the full year together for the combined portfolio largely driven to those select above market leases.","Operator","The next question will be from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, everyone. Just want to ask a question about some of the initiatives, Bill, that you mentioned earlier, the executive sponsorship and some of the customer service initiatives that you talked about at the Investor Day. First, just curious from a spending perspective on the SG&A front, how much of the costs for some of those programs are already in the run rate and how much is on the com? And also just curious, I think, speed which you mentioned has been a criticism of the company in the past. Curious, if you have any stats on how long it takes to get leases done today versus maybe six months ago? And then just one other follow-up.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, I'll ask Andy to cover the SG&A question. On the second part, we actually looked at this in the fourth quarter and we've taken eight days out of the process for documentation in this last quarter on average. So we've shortened that I think pretty substantially, but I would tell you, there is a great deal of variety. I mean look, if you \u2013 we are doing business with a customer with whom we've done a lot of business before, we can ink a deal in just a couple days and it can be a very large deal, if it's a new customer then that obviously would \u2013 can take longer.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And then on the spend and kind of investment in our customers, in our systems, in our teams, Vin, I think, you're probably harking back to a slide from our Investor Day in December really showing the power of the platform and our scale and being able to invest I think in the last year 100 basis points of revenue back into the business, and still maintain industry leading EBITDA and G&A margins. That spend was really illustrative. It's going to come in many forms, it's going to come in the G&A line, in terms of investment in our team, hiring the right sales personnel, or it's going to come in our systems. We launched a new accounting system for our colo platform in Europe this year. It's going to come in the capital side in terms of integrating our latest acquisition. It's going to come on the marketing side, but all in all that spend is going to be spent throughout 2018 and is fully baked into the numbers that we've put in our guidance table released at the beginning of the year, fully incorporated.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Vincent, it's Dan Papes, if I could just add a few comments to actually on top of Bill's. Our executive sponsorship program relating back to the SG&A question cost us a little bit airfare other than that having our leadership team out in the field, talking to our customer, executives, understanding their needs, responding to unique requirements that they may have, has paid great dividends at very little expense to the company and has also informed us as a leadership team to be more effective in some of the strategic decisions we make. So that's made a big difference. Another is again, it didn't take any G&A for us to take a look at our processes and our approval processes and how we how we work bids through our system, and shorten those timeframes meaningfully in order to be able to accommodate our customers and eliminate this stigma that you mentioned of us being slow. We get \u2013 in the last six months we've gotten just really, really positive feedback from our customers, from brokers, from partners about the fact that people are seeing us to be faster on our feet, more flexible and working together with our customers in a customer centric way that's making a difference. All of those things translate into less tangible, but certainly very meaningful benefits to us as a company, I think that the business results have been and will continue to be positively influenced by that.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks a lot for that. That's very helpful. I just \u2013 my second question is just, trends seem to be moving in the right direction, leasing volumes have been pretty healthy here over the last couple quarters. Industry commentary also seems to be pretty favorable from a demand perspective. The one metric that seems to be a little bit at odds with this is the same-store NOI growth which seems \u2013 has been softening a little bit, still positive, but curious if you could provide any color on, on what's driving that trend?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Vin, I think, we're going to give you an exception for the third question here. So \u2013 and I'll do the honor. So same-store NOI growth little softer this year in our guide and our guidance relative to 2017, and also we've put up in the fourth quarter and really has to do with some episodic churn and the re-leasing of that capacity. Obviously, as you see from our stats, we typically retain 75% to 80% of our customer's expirations, even higher than that sometimes on the colocation, but we don't retain 100%. Two specific churn events that are impacting the same-store pool; one in Phoenix where a systems integrator lost its end customer, and let its lease lapse at expiration that happened at the very end of the year, another one that's expected to happen in the very beginning of 2018 is in Boston.","Now, again these are down \u2013 essentially downtime for \u2013 associated with re-leasing of that space that is putting a negative headwind to the year-over-year same-store growth. Not all just glass half-full, because in Phoenix, that's a market where we've been essentially full in terms of capacity, so this brings on some attractive inventory, it's a space where actually we should be able to densify it and bring incremental power, so we're able to generate potentially higher revenue from that footprint. So there is an upside, but there will be a downside, in terms of, in your cash for that asset.","And then in Boston, this \u2013 that was a scale customer that is churning out, and that gives us \u2013 gave us an opportunity to re-productize a portion of that space as colocation, and we launched that along with Service Exchange in the Boston market. That goes very well with our recently hired sales team members to form the Boston market coming online at the end of last year. So, we think that same-store pool should accelerate coming out of 2018.","Operator","The next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Looking at the joint venture with Mitsubishi, can you give us some color on their data centers that are contributing and how utilized they are and how we should think about that? And then I guess a question for Dan around the sales force. Have you completed the reorg with sort of all the moving parts there and where are you finding the sales people here, are you seeing with demand high for the industry you're having trouble with churn or how should we think about that? Thanks.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Frank, Scott here. I'm looking for the exact numbers. They are largely utilized, I think, they're north of 80% utilized in there; and I can get you the \u2013 I'll get back to you with the exact number on that. But there is some upside potential there with the additional leasing.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Frank, to your second question about the sales force. So, yes, the restructuring of our sales forces is completed. Always will be some small adjustments here and there, but we really completed the major part of the restructuring in the second quarter last year, and then it was a matter of it settling in which happened in the third quarter for the most part, and then the fourth quarter was us operating in the new business model, which to me will \u2013 that new business model would just get better and better for us as we go forward.","As far as churn goes, there is no question. It is a very competitive market for talent, especially in the colocation space, but we are \u2013 we're finding people, we're not finding them quite at the pace that we'd like, but we have most of our head count slots full now, which is great. And the places that we're getting them, we're getting them at our competitors. We're getting them from our competitors with our \u2013 I'll call it sort of our new story about the way we're trying to operate in the market with customer centricity, we're getting them with our \u2013 basically our very strong business results.","They want to come work in a company that's stable, established, doing well and has a growth plan. I'll also say that they \u2013 there are a couple of companies that have exited this \u2013 the colocation and connectivity business or sold their businesses, or have been acquired. And those salespeople, the top salespeople in those organizations they don't want that instability. They want the stability of being in a firm like ours. And so when we have conversations with them, when we tell them our story, it's been positive for us from a recruiting perspective.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. And hey, Frank, the \u2013 just give you the breakdown. The north building in Mitaka was 73% occupied and the south building is 86% occupied, and then blended together it's 78% occupied.","Operator","The next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the colo business, the \u2013 with the scale business we could see volatility, but it seems like there's been more focus on the colo business, more capacity dedicated to it. Is this level of signings to the $9 million range and then maybe higher kind of the new level we should be looking for, and what's driving it? Is it the focus or is it the supply or kind of everything kind of coming together on that aspect of the business? And then a quick follow-up on maintenance recurring CapEx that was up a little bit, wanted to get a little more detail on how should we think about that going forward?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I'll take the first. Andy will address the second. The colo business, not sure exactly how you phrased that, Richard, but we're \u2013 we want to grow that colocation business, back to Jordan's question about growth from Investor Day. We're trying to grow meaningfully in our scale business and we're trying to grow meaningfully in our colocation business. A lot of the transformation we went through last year was in that colocation go to market space, and we \u2013 it is our strong intent to continue to grow our colocation business, it may be just a little bit lumpy, less lumpy of course than the scale business, but we intend to make that go up into the right with our team.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Just around that, I'll hit on the CapEx. I think, it's \u2013 if you look at the progression through the year, you should look at kind of the colocation and connectivity lines of almost kind of hand-in-hand because the bulk of that connectivity are from those colocation customers. The trajectory of the year during the changes in the sales team, we were a little bit softer in the first two quarters in our new logo adds. That's stepped up in the third quarter from 30 to 36, and then stepped up to a record of 51 in the fourth quarter, including a record in Europe in particular of 13 new logos, all colo oriented.","And then that ties to the mix of space and power which flows to the colocation size and the connectivity. A lot of those new logos are coming to Digital for the first time, coming to our ecosystems within our gateways, or our campuses, taking our digital cage cabinets and power requirements and base requirements from connectivity. And then we think that'll spur incremental connectivity from other customers in those assets want \u2013 seeking to connect to them. So we're quite pleased with the overall combined results, which is about a, I think, 14% step up on for colo and connectivity combined quarter-over-quarter and we're looking to continue to drive that growth.","And then lastly, on your other question, about a $10 million increase quarter-over-quarter to recurring CapEx, the bulk of that was actually related to something not core to our business. We spent some capital on the tenant improvement front to re-tenant a office building in California, in the East Bay asset that was not a data center that dates back to our pre-IPO days. And we re-tenanted that asset and just sold that beginning of the year for \u2013 I believe north of $70 million, $75 million. So part of our capital recycling program. So that non-core spend was a major driver in that quarter-over-quarter CapEx \u2013 recurring CapEx step up.","Operator","The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks. In your prepared remarks, Bill, you talked about the tax reform and the benefits from companies bringing tax \u2013 bringing their cash overseas and investing more in the U.S. Apple is somebody who's talked a lot about that. Just kind of curious if you could expand more on what the opportunity is there, and if you're actually seeing an increase in RFPs out there in the market from these type of customers as a result of tax reform? And then somewhat related it seems like every year we're hearing more and more about sustainability. You guys have been certainly talking about it more. I'm curious if you could \u2013 I don't know if you have any numbers to quantify around this, but to the extent that you have customers that are able to build their own facilities, what can you offer in terms of facilities you build that are sustainable, comparable to what a lot of these large guys can build on their own?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So, on tax reform, I would tell you that the pipeline of opportunities that we're seeing right now is bigger than anything I've seen since I started with the company in 2004. Now whether that's attributable to tax reform, I don't know. It may be due to just cloud and other technological trends, but it's definitely larger by a fair degree than anything I've seen before.","So in terms of the sustainability initiatives, we've been pursuing that for the last few years. We've won a number of awards for it, we've been recognized for it by NAREIT as the \u2013 it's called the Leader in the Light award within the data center group, and so we're very proud of that. And we've actually partnered with some of our customers trying to let them leverage our contracts and our connections in this area in sustainable power, so \u2013 and we've actually some of the RFPs we've responded to have green energy as a prerequisite to bidding. So it's very important to us and it's important to I would say a high percentage of the customers with whom we work. Andy or Dan, anything you'd like to add?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yes. I would add, Jon, on the sustainability point that Bill made. We \u2013 our customers talk about it, talk about that with us all the time. And it's one of those situations where we can make it work for our customers. And it ends up just being a good thing because sustainability, we all would agree is a good thing in principle. It also happens to be very good business and our customers are urging us to focus on this. We're doing so and that works really well between them and us.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions, two if I may. First, I believe commencements were $38 million in the quarter and according to the last waterfall chart, I think, it implied $48 million. So, commencements were a little lower, and I was wondering if that was just \u2013 if that was customer driven or availability driven? And secondly, I appreciate all the really positive commentary about the scale of the pipeline. And I was wondering if you know given the secular strength and the progress you've made with the sales organization and flexibility, if you could \u2013 there is a way to quantify that difference, maybe from a year-over-year perspective?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Rob, this is Andy. I'm just trying to find the prior quarter commencements. I \u2013 the bridge, I know, is we added $50 million, we took out $38 million, and we lost $2 million because of the JV. So, maybe we can follow-up just to figure out the details, there is a nuance quarter-over-quarter.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Sure.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And then the second question was quantify the difference year mix in terms of all the changes. Dan, do you want to take a stab at that?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Robert, so this is sort of this early on in these changes, I wouldn't dare to quantify it, the impact at this point. I do know we've won some deals that I suspect we might not have won, had we been the company of 18 or 24 months ago. I know that we're having discussions with some customers who previously wouldn't put us on the bidders list or call us when they had a requirement. So there's no question in our mind that the changes in the way we're doing things is having a positive impact. I am sorry. I'd love to put a number on it, but we know it's making a difference and it's my hope and expectation that that's going to be one of the factors that's going to show in the growth results that we're going to deliver here as a company over time.","Operator","The next question will be from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just a clarification on the $6 million contribution from interconnection booking that was highlighted in the press release. I was hoping you could tell us more about this, was this from handful of customers or was this from a single \u2013 or the majority from a single customer, for instance a global car provider that is trying to aggressively expand globally right now?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Sami, our interconnection signings is incredibly diverse. I can tell you the largest single contributor is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, I mean, it's any given signing. So that was not one big cross connection \u2013 cross connect signing, it was a \u2013 it's from numerous carriers, it's from numerous cloud providers, enterprises assortment. Now, it's largely concentrated, one in our colocation facilities both in North American and Europe. Two, in our most highly connected ecosystems within our Internet gateways and then supplemented with connectivity on our campus colocation outfits, but it is a very diverse mix of signings.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. And then recently Digital announced Oracle will be expanding in 14 new locations. And then at their cloud event earlier this week, they announced global plans. Will they be building their own data centers in some of these new markets, or are they \u2013 or is the announcement in coordination with Digital as they go global and expand and kind of put a little bit of catch up with the bigger cloud providers?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sami, I'm going to have Chris Sharper, our CTO tackle that one, because he is heavily involved with that announcement.","Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Absolutely. Thank you, Andy. Definitely, Oracle is growing rather rapidly, and so we're very proud of the partnership we've been able to put in the market with them, and it's definitely an early innings, I would say, on the amount of ecosystems that are going to be built around that infrastructure. So we're very excited about that. But definitely the growth that they're starting to put out into the market, I think, they'll look at all of their options. And what's nice about Digital is, we have the heritage to do it from build-to-suit where we can support them in that manner.","But all the way across the board to helping them in our existing facilities globally, and so that's why we see a lot of early success in this already, and we continue to see a growth pattern, not only for Oracle, but all these major cloud providers as they start to really invest in that global platform to access their customers privately and securely in a very efficient manner.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And just to clarify, I think, the second part of your question, Sami. The \u2013 not to name any specific customers, but I would say by and large, the majority of our customers are seeking us to pursue an outsourced third party multi-customer data center environment, not to go do it on their own. Even the most well large capitalized, I think that's due to our value proposition of having a global footprint of highly connected assets, the campuses and the land to future proof our customers growth. And I would think that based on the fact we've seen that name you just mentioned quickly ascend our top customers' list that they are no different.","Operator","And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. One, we demonstrated our commitment to prudent capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders. We harvested mature assets to recycle capital where appropriate. We invested opportunistically in core domestic markets to earn acceptable current return with an opportunity to generate future upside from further value creation. And we extended our global platform to enter a highly strategic new international market with a well-respected local partner.","Two, we made significant progress towards finalizing the integration of our recent acquisitions, delivering on our stated expense synergy targets and building on the established customer relationships to realize revenue synergies as well.","Three, we beat the high end of our initial 2017 guidance range and set the stage for sustainable growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends per share in 2018 and beyond. Fourth, last but not least, our disciplined capital allocation and deliberate balance sheet management has positioned us to safely navigate a rising interest rate environment and self-fund our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying a thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution.","Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you later this year at the various investor conferences. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for participating in today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Stewart","Thank you, Dan. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including 2016 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein","Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to begin today with the discussion on governance. We recently announced that Laurence Chapman has been named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors in keeping with our commitment to sound corporate governance practices and longer-term succession planning. The Board expects to appoint Laurence as Chairman of the Board at its next Annual Meeting in May 2017.","Many of you have had the opportunity to interact with Dennis Singleton, who has served as our Chairman since April 2012 when the Company\u2019s founder resigned from the Board. Dennis led the Board during a period of significant transition, including a change in CEO as well as several other executives, a change in Board composition, and two strategic acquisitions that have meaningfully enhanced the Company\u2019s growth profile and product mix. It is expected that Dennis will continue to serve on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors after he steps down as Chairman.","In addition, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Mark Patterson has joined our Board effective yesterday. Many of you may also be familiar with Mark. He was formerly the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Merrill Lynch and prior to that he was the Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking at Citi Group. He serves on the board of UDR as well as General Growth. We are absolutely delighted to welcome Mark to our Board. The governance principle behind these changes is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity.","I would also like to remind you that we maintain a destaggered Board. The majority of our Directors fees are paid in stock. Each of our Directors maintains a sizable investment in the Company. The Board and Senior Management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements. And finally, since 2014 100% of the senior management teams long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder performance.","We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Along those lines we announced several industry-leading sustainability initiatives earlier this month including a long-term agreement to procure wind power offsetting 100% of our U.S. colocation and interconnection energy footprint.","Let\u2019s turn to Page 2 of our presentation to recap the guide posts of our strategic plan. Delivering superior risk adjusted returns is our guiding principle. This entails emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet. We are focused on the accretive deployment of capital and we are willing to turndown deals that do not provide a sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We also execute when we can achieve the best long-term outcome for shareholders irrespective of short-term reporting requirements.","In terms of capital allocation, the highlight of the second quarter was the agreement that we reached to acquire a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt, three of the most important interconnection hubs in Europe as shown here on Page 3. This transaction met all of our acquisition criteria. It was strategic and complimentary to our existing business financially accretive and prudently financed.","These eight data centers are highly complementary to our European platform. The portfolio serves more than 650 customers predominantly concentrated in the network cloud and IT services, content and digital media and financial services verticals. The concentration lines up very well with our target customer verticals and more than 80% of these customers are new relationships to Digital Realty.","In addition, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, underscoring the value of these new customer relationships. As you know, this sales process was dictated by the European Commission with the clear objective of standing up a business that would be immediately competitive in the marketplace.","What you may not know is that this business came staffed with 130 employees including 16 sales and marketing professionals. In contrast to the Telx acquisition, we have not underwritten any expense synergies in this acquisition. We are very pleased with the caliber of the personnel as well as the properties that we\u2019ve acquired with this transaction and we welcome these new employees to the Digital Realty family.","In terms of integration, it\u2019s still early days, but we are actively working to ensure a smooth transition for the acquired business into the Digital Realty platform. And we are leveraging the lessons learned from the Telx integration to create a seamlessly repeatable process.","Our teams are focused on communicating with our customers and employees and we are executing on short-term objectives for the business, moving people, integrating processes and standardizing reporting. Over the next quarter, we\u2019ll finalize the plan to extend our colocation and interconnection platform and we will communicate it as appropriate. I should pause here for a moment to address the impact of Brexit.","We did anticipate a potential Brexit scenario in our underwriting and we did hedge the purchase price, but we have not altered our global strategy. Fundamentally, we do not believe the EU referendum will materially impact global data center demand or our global portfolio as the secular demand drivers remain intact and the transatlantic cable landings have not moved.","We believe our global platform is one of our key competitive advantages and we do not plan to exit either the UK or Continental Europe regardless of the outcome of the EU referendum. Early in the third quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell our fully leased [san andonin] data center in Paris to Equinix for approximately $210 million or $575 per square foot.","Also early in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of a four property data center portfolio as shown here on Page 4. The sales price was a $115 million or roughly $250 per square foot. Excluding 251 exchange, where the sole tenant is moving out this month. The portfolio cap rate is in the low 6s on forward contractual cash NOI and in the mid 7s assuming the near-term expiration were to renew. Since embarking on our capital recycling program in the second quarter of 2014, we have sold 10 properties and one investment generating net proceeds of $420 million not including the Paris property now under contract.","As I\u2019ve said previously, we\u2019ve been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets and this portfolio sale substantially concludes our capital recycling program. We do however continue to believe that calling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties or one-off assets that no longer fit our global connected campus strategy.","In terms of expanding our product offerings, we\u2019ve been working closely with our customers and leveraging the combined heritage of Digital Realty as a large footprint leader in addition to the Telx colocation and interconnection legacy. We are close to launching our service exchange which will further allow us to enable customers with dynamically interconnected large footprint and colocation data center solutions on a seamless connected campus uniquely meeting customer requirements.","The service exchange is core to empowering hybrid cloud and IoT architectures in an extremely efficient and agile manner. We look forward to providing more details over the coming months and unveiling the benefits of the service exchange with our robust cloud ecosystem partners. In addition, we are continuing to make solid progress on the Telx integration. We are executing our systems roadmap. That work is on track and is expected to continue for the next several quarters.","We planned to sunset the Telx brand during the third quarter and we are in the process of unifying our multi-product global sales force which we also expect to complete during the third quarter. Along similar lines, our partners and alliances program continues to expand. I am pleased to announce that CenturyLink, our second largest customer has joined our program enhancing options for connectivity, managed services and cloud services for our customers.","During the second quarter, the partners and alliances program continue to drive revenues, including for hybrid cloud deployments that highlight the benefits of our connected campus strategy. I am pleased with the progress that we are making. In addition to adding CenturyLink to our partners and alliances program during the second quarter, we have begun executing on transactions for hybrid cloud deployments with one of our best customers and partners in advance of our formal go-to-market campaign which is set to begin shortly. As a result, we have already begun to realize revenue from this partnership and we expect to see even greater uptake once we formally launched the campaign.","During the first half of the year, the partners and alliances group increased the total contract value of deals executed by more than 20% albeit off a modest base. The pipeline remains robust at approximately $40 million even after several deals were executed during the second quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. New supplies picked up in Dallas and Northern Virginia over the past 90 days. Given the sector\u2019s recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, demand is robust in both of these markets and pre-leasing levels on development pipelines are healthy.","In addition, current market vacancy rates are low at our own portfolios in these markets are likewise north of 90% leased. Northern Virginia and Dallas are both national data center markets characterized by robust leasing velocity and solidly positive net absorption.","And now let\u2019s turn to the macro environment on Page 6. The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly over the past 90 days, primarily due to uncertainty in the wake of the Brexit referendum. That data center industry has the good fortune of being levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both someone independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy.","We believe it\u2019s still early days for cloud adoption and the related build-out of cloud service providers compute node footprints. Although cloud requirements are lumpy and price sensitive. From where we sit and looks like the wave of cloud service provider demand has not crested yet. And we see a set way building on the horizon from the Internet of Things and connected devices.","Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30% of enterprises will use cloud service providers direct when cloud connectivity services up from less than 1% at the end of last year. Given is expected growth strategic planners at the cloud providers are actively mapping out their approach. We believe that we are well-positioned to support this continued growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet the full spectrum of our customers data center demand requirements on a global basis.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results. Andy?","Andrew Power","Thank you, Bill. Let\u2019s begin with our leasing activity on Page 8. We signed new leases totally $15 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, including a $6 million colocation space and power contribution. Interconnection contributed an additional $8 million and our total bookings for the second quarter were a little over $22 million of annualized GAAP revenue.","While this is towards the lower end of our recent activity levels. We are taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global connected campus footprint. We are winning diverse demand across attractive verticals including cloud service providers both big and small along with other growing segments of digital economy, IT service providers and other large sophisticated users.","You\u2019ll note the appearance of a Fortune 50 hyper-scale cloud service provider on our top twenty customer list this quarter. At the same time we also added more than forty new logos for the second consecutive quarter. Long story short we are focused on landing demand from a diverse and growing customer set. Along those lines, I am pleased to report that during the month of July we have already signed an additional $20 million of total bookings, including space, power and interconnection.","This activity has included significant singings across all three geographic regions including a healthy mix of large enterprise software cloud providers, hyper-scale cloud providers, IT service providers and financial service customers. The total bookings figure includes $6 million of annualized colocation and interconnection bookings.","In fact, the month of July has already been the best month for Telx since our acquisition. While we are not satisfied with the level of large footprint leasing during the second quarter. The pipeline for the second half is sizable and we are cautiously optimistic that we are back on track to return to normalize activity levels in the second half of the year.","Turning to our backlog on Page 9. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced standard $70 million. The bulk of which is expected commenced within the next 12 months. The weighted average lag between second quarter signings and commencements was a record low at 1.5 months.","Turning to renewal leasing activity on Page 10, we retained 85% of second quarter lease expirations and we signed just under $60 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash releasing spread was up a little less than 3% overall with a positive cash mark-to-market across all property types, including another quarter of plus 5% for colocation.","This was a bit better than expected largely because we did not execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix and on the East Coast that we have called out last quarter. We do still expect to renew those leases later this year, so we may see negative cash mark-to-market on our second half renewals. For the full year we now expect releasing spread to be slightly positive on a cash basis up from our previous guidance of flat on a cash basis.","In general we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we\u2019re making on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","Let\u2019s turn to Telx here on Page 11. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $94 million of revenue during the second quarter representing 9% growth year-over-year. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50 interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 11%.","From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expend synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the second quarter. Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts and we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. We have added a number of new sales reps who have already begun contributing to the success of this business.","As part of integrating our global sales force we planned to add - continue to add sales resources through the end of the year including key position to drive our vertical ecosystem development and solutions efforts. The colocation and interconnection strategy has been to focus on key facilities and drive growth associated with our ecosystem including multi-site customer wins. We are seeing progress across five emerging ecosystems, networks, subsea cable systems, mobile, digital content and over the top distribution and the cloud community.","During the second quarter, we announced that we landed another undersea cable system in our Hillsboro, Oregon facility. Subsea cable systems are an area of particular focus for us and we have had success today in the Pacific Northwest where there has been a heightened interest in landing cables.","In mid May we announced that we will be launching colocation and interconnection services on our Ashburn campus during the third quarter. We are scheduled to launch in September but the sale team has begun pre-selling the site. And we already signed a handful of new deals.","In addition, Atlanta has shown significant growth over the past few years and we are completely sold out. So we have begun working to bring on additional capacity to accommodate our overflow from 56 Marietta and should launch early next year. As mentioned last quarter Marketplace Live will take place in New York on September 22.","We look forward to providing updates on products and services and formally introduced in our revised branding and we hope many of you will be able to join us there. In summary, at the one year mark since the Telx acquisition announcement we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets and complete the integration process.","Turning to our financial results on Page 12, we reported 2Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.04 ahead of consensus. The outperformance was fairly broad based with the topline OpEx, G&A and interest expense is a penny ahead of expectations. AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the beat at the FFO line as well as accretion from Telx and a further reduction in straight line rental revenue as shown on Page 13.","Recurring CapEx was also down significantly again this quarter. Although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up in the second half of the year. Since a portion of the lower CapEx spend is essentially timing related the second quarter AFFO per share growth is somewhat inflated. But nonetheless we\u2019re well on our way to delivering the double-digit AFFO per share growth we committed to at our Investor Day last October.","The AFFO payout ratio is now sub 70% and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital. The current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. The bottom line is that quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating reflecting the improved underwriting discipline we\u2019ve instilled over the past two years along with consistently improving data center market fundamentals.","As you may have seen from the press release we raised our core FFO per share guidance by $0.10 at both ends of the range. We\u2019ve raised the full year projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points again this quarter to 57% at the midpoint. You may recall from our Investor Day presentation last October, the lease set out a target of a 200 basis point EBITDA margin expansion by 2018 from 55% to 57%.","We are nowhere close to hanging out the mission accomplished banner today and we do expect the EBITDA margin will continue to fluctuate over time as we reinvest in the business, but we are pleased with the progress we are making towards the final objective on our three-year guideposts achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share.","We also raised our 2016 same capital cash NOI growth guidance again this quarter by 150 basis points at the low end up to 2.5% to 4% or roughly 3.5% to 5% on a constant currency basis. FX represented roughly 50 to 100 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on Page 14. I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.","As shown on Page 15, the UK represents approximately 13% of total revenues and approximately 5% is denominated in euros. Pro forma for the eight property portfolio acquisitions that closed in July. However, as you can see from the table in the middle of the page, we have over $1 billion of strong debt outstanding and we also completed our inaugural $600 million Eurobond offering earlier this year.","We have effectively matched the currency of our assets with our liabilities in these markets. So our total European net asset exposure including currency hedges is less than 5%. We may tap the sterling bond market again either later this year or earlier next year to further naturally hedge our sterling-denominated assets.","Finally, I\u2019d like to point out that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure; it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements, our strategic customers around the world which we believe is a key competitive advantage. In terms of our second quarter operating performance, same capital occupancy was flat sequentially at 93%. Overall portfolio occupancy dipped 50 basis points sequentially to 90.4% due primarily to development deliveries placed in service in our highest demand markets.","We expect overall portfolio occupancy to pick back up by the end of the year. Same capital cash NOI was up 3.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 3.6%.","Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet beginning on Page 16. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering in mid-May to permanently finance the European portfolio acquisition. The underwriters also exercised their overallotment option in full, so we expect to receive total net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements.","In the interest of time, I won\u2019t dwell on the mechanics today, but I would like to point out that we have included a Slide here of Page 16 that does provide some detail on the mechanics of the forward sale agreements for those who may be interested. When we close the portfolio acquisition in early July, we initially funded the purchase with a drawdown on our line of credit in an effort to match sources and uses, which we have attempted to layout for you on Page 17.","In addition to the proceeds from the equity offering, we expected to close on the portfolio sale as well the Paris option property. In terms of timing for the uses, the preferred equity is not reviewable and the mortgage debt is not pre-payable until later this summer. Consequently, we expect to settle all or substantially all of the forward sale agreements by the end of the third quarter as we fund the additional use of the capital laid out here on Page 17. Remember that we can flex line of credit up or down at any time, but the forward sale agreement is a one-way drawdown.","Finally, on Page 18, we provided a recap of our 2016 capital markets activity on the right as well as the pro forma impact from the equity offering and the European portfolio acquisition on the left hand side. As you can see we are keeping our balance sheet well positioned for new investment opportunities consistent with our financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Dan, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the rent question. You talked about positive releasing spreads and the mark-to-market across the portfolio rising. Can you talk a little bit about the trends in rents you\u2019re seeing in your markets and given essentially rising occupancies across most portfolios and very high pre-leasing rates amongst the development this out there?","Matthew Miszewski","Yes, Jordan, it\u2019s Matt Miszewski. Thanks for the question. In keeping in alignment with what Andy have stated in his opening remarks and especially in our core markets but more broadly as well we see stable to slightly improving rates, which also happen to be coupled with some of the great work that Jarrett\u2019s team is involved we\u2019ve been focused on cost containment in design and construction.","So that we expect as the programs that we\u2019re developing right now move forward to have even better performance from a pricing perspective. As our ecosystem development work that\u2019s underway right now starts to take hold. The pre-leasing rates that in these markets similarly look good. Internationally in particular rates look fairly strong. So strength in Chicago, in Ashburn, in Dallas and in Singapore which is great given the new facility that we just launched.","Jordan Sadler","So it sounds like you are trying to, I mean, rates are stable now, but you are trying to dry them a little bit with some of the new programs. I guess as a follow-up, A, if you guys could characterize the funnel, it sounds like while this quarter was not the most robust in terms of total leasing volume, it sounds like there is a significant pipeline behind it. July was big. How would you characterize the funnel? Since you\u2019re being selective, how would you characterize the funnel in terms of high margin versus lower margin opportunities?","William Stein","Great question Jordan and really since before the acquisition of Telx but really with the acquisition of Telx and working closely with that team we\u2019ve been focused on making sure that the funnel is not just full, but it\u2019s full of the right opportunities in the right target accounts.","Given our targeted focus on SMACC continuing, social mobile, analytics cloud and content, but especially inside that cloud and social verticals our funnel has been slightly - it has slightly improving margins in it currently and I do say currently because its pipeline and we have to close, but we\u2019re pretty happy that we\u2019ve been able to slightly expand the margin inside the funnel as we start to work together with multiple products.","In addition but we\u2019ve been working together very, very closely with multiple clouds - large cloud service providers to make sure that we can match value for value going forward given their demand and given our capacity and given the pipeline, the pipeline margins this would give the pipeline margins for the rest of this fiscal year and moving into Q1 of 2017 potentially better outcome.","Jordan Sadler","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, is your line on mute?","Jonathan Atkin","Sorry about that. So I was interested the remaining milestones that you have perhaps on the operations side. You talked about integrating the sales force and retiring the brand, but what remains to be done with the Telx integration as well as what would be some of the initial milestones as you look at the European assets that you just acquired?","Andrew Power","Thanks, Jonathan, this is Andy. In terms of remaining milestones I would say unifying the brand under one brand across the Company is a big one, one global sales force is another big one that is going on, both of those going on really right now. Remaining milestones other than, obviously, meeting or exceeding our underwriting targets probably be more back of the house oriented in terms of accounting systems that will eventually be fully united and kind of HRIS systems.","I think in terms of facing the customer and driving more revenue, the two that we mentioned on this call are the biggest that are kind of nearing the end zone. On the European portfolio acquisition, quite frankly its early days, we are delighted to receive approval from the commission and ultimately closing the acquisition what is I guess a handful of days or weeks ago.","We think we got a really talented team along with some very attractive assets coming on board. We have onboarded some consulting help to kind of help us simulate the 130 team members and assets with our existing franchise in Europe. So we probably have more to post you on that integration coming next earnings call, but just a handful of weeks of post closings, so far so good.","Jonathan Atkin","And then my second question or follow-up would be just on Telx and progress on some of the West Coast assets. If I look at your supplemental and kind of at the property level, it seems like it\u2019s been fairly slow initial process in seeing increasing utilization there. So I just wondered if you had any commentary on how that\u2019s progressing.","William Stein","It may have not flow through to our supplemental because until a commencement happens on a lease, it won\u2019t show up in a utilization stat and some of those buildings are kind of portions of our building, so you can\u2019t always see it transparently. We have seen some traction increase not on the East Coast, but also the West Coast.","I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s kind of coastal specific, I think it\u2019s more a testament to onboarding more QBRs and we have several on-ramp that newly joined the Company. And they\u2019ve, quite frankly, the new QBRs have driven a lot of new logos and customers which is what I would say attributed to Telx\u2019s successor in the quarter which was certainly backend loaded more towards June and the beginning of the quarter and then that success is certainly spilled over in the month of July.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Lukas Hartwich","Thank you. Hey, guys. You kind of touch on this already, but I\u2019m just curious how long do you to think it\u2019s going to take to integrate fully the recent Equinix deal and then also along with that, does that kind of limit your ability to do other acquisitions or do you feel like you still have capacity to do other deals?","Andrew Power","Maybe just to rehash Lukas on the first part then I\u2019ll hand it back to Bill and Scott on other deals. I mean quite frankly, we\u2019re fortunate very similarly to our Telx acquisition in buying a very strategic and complimentary collection of assets and team members. In Europe, previously our position was much more anchored around our scale leasing and more campus oriented products.","What we\u2019ve closed on with the eight assets and that team is prized assets in the Dockland of London or the size parker Amsterdam or actually in Frankfurt it works very well with the land we purchased and a sales force oriented towards selling that small footprint, higher price point, colocation and interconnection oriented offering. So that\u2019s what makes this one a little bit easier, is that there is no expense synergies being sought here.","We actually want to put additional resources to support the sales force. It\u2019s very complementary with the existing team over there. They\u2019ll be moving into our office on Gracechurch Street within the month where we had a little space to fit the corporate team. And so I don\u2019t have a date to fill, but I think this one could actually integrate more efficiently or more timely than Telx. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bill and Scott to handle the back half of your question.","William Stein","Hey, Lukas. So as Andy said, actually I feel like we\u2019re further along on the equity assets than Telx at the same time just because of the nature of the acquisition, so I think it should take less time. So looking at the M&A environment, there are certainly quite a few opportunities out there. I think that been written about. And Scott and his team are constantly scanning landscape and looking at those opportunities and we will see what happens. Scott, do you want to add anything to that.","Scott Peterson","Yes. I would agree we\u2019re focused on integration. We want to be good stewards of our shareholder capital. I think one of the great aspects of these two acquisitions is these platforms give us a lot of flexibility. We can grow the platforms organically. We could grow through M&A, but we have a lot of flexibility and that allows us remain disciplined in our future M&A activity.","Lukas Hartwich","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael","Great. Thank you. I wanted to start with the leasing numbers, the $15 million in the quarter. Would you characterize that more a function, and it being lower than what you\u2019ve been doing, which you characterize that more a function of you\u2019re not chasing the deals that are out there because you think that the returns don\u2019t meet your criteria? Did you not necessarily have capacity in the markets where some of the bigger deals were being won this particular quarter? Or is it that you actually are bidding and you\u2019re losing out perhaps to others?","And then I guess just a follow-up to that, in your prepared remarks, Bill, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think that the cloud demand has crested yet and I guess that ties into some of the color that Matt gave in the first as it relates to the funnel and how you think you could see some strong demand I guess in the back half of this year and then into the first quarter and that could give higher margin. I was wondering if you can just give a little bit more specificity around what areas or what gives you the confidence that you guys will actually be involved with some of the cloud demand in the back half of the year? Thanks.","William Stein","Thanks for the question and thanks for fitting five questions into one question.","Colby Synesael","That\u2019s a south-side skill.","William Stein","Yes. You had south-side got that skill. That\u2019s right. So I would certainly characterize it as you did. I was not pleased with what I call below average scale product signings in the quarter. We do think that the pace was due to a couple of things that you mentioned, but also the normal lumpiness that\u2019s become part of our business especially given the new hyper-scale demand that\u2019s out there. But also as you said a more selective approach to making sure that we land the right mix of customers at the maximum - to maximize the long-term value that we think we have inside of our ecosystem.","So this means, as you said one of the potential reasons for that number is our continued commitment to a disciplined approach to our underwriting criteria and focusing really on top tier markets and not focusing on tertiary markets where some customers may have a desire to go and then maintaining a disciplined underwriting and pricing regimen to protect long-term value.","And on your second question, really the overall demand remains strong. It\u2019s evident by the July that we\u2019ve had so far in both sections of our global business as well as the healthy pipeline that I talked about which has the potential for margin expansion as we move on. We do think that we\u2019re on track now to resume normal levels in the second half across all parts of the business in 2016.","Specifically though with regard to your question about demand and cloud demand remaining strong especially where we are in our global markets where we operate. It\u2019s important to remember that that cloud business is still one of the fastest growing segments landing in our industry and from analysts from right scale all the way through to Gartner they all tend to agree that we are actually in the early innings of this new cloud ecosystem breaking out.","We are also starting to see the green shoots. We\u2019re seeing mass adoption of a diversity of cloud players not just the major cloud players and early adopters that are out there which we think and to get your last question. We think we\u2019re uniquely situated to be able to land.","We do believe that we\u2019re the only Company in this space that is very focused on providing great scale solutions for folks who need scale solutions including those cloud service providers, but also providing colocation right next to it at a latency that can\u2019t be beat as well as the security that comes with the power of private networking or interconnection products. So we really think that the secular demand drivers in the cloud industry are continuing to push them and we are uniquely situated to be able to address it.","Colby Synesael","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Petersen","Great. Thank you. I guess just to follow-up on the leasing volumes, I mean, I know you can certainly have bad quarters. But this is essentially three quarters in a row where your volumes have been below some of your wholesale peers. I\u2019ll just name them, like DuPont and CyrusOne. And so I guess given your comments on focusing on profitability over velocity, I guess that it kind of begs the question if the achievable profitability or the yields on these facilities have declined permanently and you guys just need to move your rents down to compete better.","Andrew Power","Sure. Let me timing this is Andy. Since matching dress and some of these already. So a couple topics one timing why I\u2019d always love to have a better fiscal second quarter rather have a better deal on July 1, then a less attractive deal on the June 30. So I think you saw a little bit of that with the volume of sign that just got signed the first few days or weeks of the month of July.","And just to put a little more meat on the bone that\u2019s going from a diversity of different types of customers. It\u2019s included hyper-scale top three cloud providers, a sizable chunk from other cloud providers that aren\u2019t in the top three and then another chunk from the rest of what we call smack of the digital economy or IT services or other transaction verticals. So we\u2019re seeing that our demand signings in the second quarter and July from diverse growing customer sets.","The other thing I think that to draws the distinction, it is not just about pricing the profitability to we\u2019re really focused on driving the long-term growth in the cash flow and attractiveness in value of our assets our campuses and our gateways with a diversity of different customers versus some of our peers who may be more focused on being in non-core market to us or doing a full build to suit with one customer in one shot. So we always want more exposure and more signings at the right rates from the top cloud providers but we\u2019re focused on collective portfolio and drove that cash flow and value our assets.","Matthew Miszewski","And Jon just to give you a little bit of color. While we had a good quarter with regard to those top cloud service providers still 37% of the revenue we closed year-to-date has come from other cloud service providers. So we have a diversity of cloud exposure including 50 new logos that were landed year-to-date inside the smack verticals. So we\u2019re fairly happy with that diversity.","Jonathan Petersen","Okay, and then just thank you for that. And then just kind of an unrelated question. On the guidance, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the $0.10 increase in the quarter. Obviously closing the EquiCiti assets, I would think, is what is driving the underlying increase. You also have cash rent growth. Now you\u2019re expecting it to be positive rather than flat so all these kind of positive moves and yet I don\u2019t see any change to top-line revenue. Help me kind of understand why we are not seeing anything increment there?","William Stein","Sure. So the breakdown on the $0.10 is really kind of a third, a third, a third story. The first third is kind of outperformance which we\u2019ve already mentioned topline G&A, OpEx. That we kind of got in the bag from the performance in the quarter. The second, third is kind of flow through from that operational performance into the back half of the year and the last third is due to the big question.","Overall net accretion from the act the - buy the European portfolio acquisition and the funding with the asset sales and the equity and also the repayment of the debt and preferred. So the third, a third, a third, a third, the first two-third operational related the last third more or more accretion from our most recent investment.","On the topline the two things what\u2019s kind of held us back from kind of nudging that up at this time, one was the - we are going to lose some revenue when we sell our fully leased property at St. Denis here fairly shortly. And two we do have some FX headwinds in the top revenue line item which or heads when it comes down to core FFO per share gains but on that top line of our guidance going to use the growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead","Vincent Chao","Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to the Equinix asset acquisitions. You made a point of pointing out the number of employees that you picked up there, including 15 sales professionals. I\u2019m just wondering at this point, have all the key players been sort of locked down in terms of them staying or is there still risk of some of those guys leaving the platform?","William Stein","Hey, Vince. The key guys are intending to stay through the balance of the year. And we\u2019re working on contracts for them that will tie them up beyond that.","Andrew Power","I would add is that this particular team really of their own volition went into this process along with these data assets to kind of essentially at the EU request set up a standalone business that could stand on its own if it had to. So talented individuals across multiple departments coming together with the strong leaders and quite fortunately landed in our hands.","We\u2019re the complimentary buyer no synergies expected, so very little overlap of any and we are able to kind of - we think the combination of our European portfolio plus data assets and teams, one plus one we feel is greater than two there.","Vincent Chao","Okay, yes. Thanks for that, and then just going back to some of the pricing commentary that we\u2019ve been talking about today, and just looking at some of the data that you provide across the supplemental that might point to improving pricing, I\u2019m looking at sort of the development yields that you\u2019re expecting are up a little bit, I think, from last quarter. I don\u2019t know if that is mix or not, but then the cash spread commentary also would point to maybe a little bit better market pricing. I\u2019m just curious what kind of market price improvement are you expecting for this year and maybe next year if you have that?","Andrew Power","You know, I quite frankly we\u2019re fairly cautious when it comes to kind of a going out too far in terms of future rank growth here. I could say at the larger end of the scale, the biggest buyers they are buying bulk and taking on numerous megawatts have the greatest pricing power and their rates are certainly flat.","They\u2019re not seeing any type of rent spike. If you walk down to the other side of the spectrum and look at our smallest footprint colocation, I think you can look at the cash release and spreads which is up now 5% for the second quarter and it was a pretty sizable this quarter actually amount of leases - just in terms of colocation that rolled up, so we were able to roll these customers up 5%. And they are able to generate some pricing power. Between those two goalposts its very market and customer episodic.","Operator","And the next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman","Hi, guys. If we look at page 16 of the supplemental, the NAV, the components of NAV, and we look at the first section which is the cash NOI by property type, it looks like there is some significant movements between the business segments. And I\u2019m just wondering if that was just a change in reporting or if there\u2019s something going on with either the revenues or the margins impacting each business, specifically with colo non-tech and then leased Internet gateway coming down pretty significantly about 16%, 18% quarter-over-quarter?","Andrew Power","Manny, I am trying to flip to get that Page and are following this financial supplemental. I think the only - I think we may be more accurately mapping towards the NOI buckets this quarter than previously. I\u2019m not aware of a dramatic change quarter-over-quarter.","Emmanuel Korchman","That\u2019s fine. We call follow-up offline on that one.","Scott Peterson","Sorry about that.","Emmanuel Korchman","No, that\u2019s all right. The other question I had for you, if you look at sort of the very, very short lease to commencement timing in this quarter, which certainly different than we have seen in the past, does that give you any concern that you\u2019re not filling the backlog? And if we look at the July 30, excuse me, the post June 30 leasing that you spoke about, is that more similar to the four to six to seven month commencement or is that also kind of here now, take now sort of lease up?","Andrew Power","I think the short number is just a smaller sample size that actually closed during the quarter. So I think you can get back to the previous bars on what the signs in July in the rest of the quarter. So I mean, we like the short side to commencement because the cash flow comes quicker, right versus kind of the leaving something that you have to build and come online in a year to two years, but I don\u2019t think one and a half months is definitely an anomaly.","William Stein","Manny, it was a disproportionate focus on market ready inventory that we were still clearing out, so I\u2019ll agree with Andy that while I would love the 1.5 to stick a little bit. You should expect to see revert to the norm coming up especially given July.","Operator","And the next question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. In terms of the large, megawatt, multi-megawatt cloud signings we\u2019ve seen this year, I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts on how competitive those bids are, what factors are going into those who are landing these deals, and I can appreciate kind of the diversity of your leasing mix here and the lumpiness of those signings, but it does appear that the rates you\u2019re signing are substantially above where we\u2019re hearing those other deals getting done. I am curious to just kind of hear your thoughts on the competitive environment behind those larger deals?","William Stein","Yes. Thanks, Matthew. So the competitive environment is I would characterize it as strong for especially what we turn the hyper-scale opportunities that are out there about 3.5 megawatts and above. And as you know we\u2019re certainly not new to the cloud service provider environment. We continue to get our fair share each and every quarter, but most importantly our focus on is on getting them at the right returns for Digital Realty, so we stay very focused on that.","With the competitive bids, it does put a certain amount of power in these cloud service providers hands and we find that the closeness that we have with a number of them and extending to all of them as we move forward gives us the ability to have that value for value conversation that I referenced earlier.","So we know that they have a high degree of value on things like inventory availability and large scale inventory availability as well as connectivity to colocation facility. And as we unearth those opportunities with cloud service providers they see the value, they match the value and it allows us to not just go to the lowest price, but to go to the best value for Digital Realty. And so that\u2019s really been our focus and it\u2019s going to continue to be.","Matthew Heinz","Okay. Thanks. And just one more as a follow-up on the guidance, I\u2019m wondering what you are assuming for revenue contribution and EBITDA this year from the EquitCiti transaction, and I guess with the revenue, again, with that number not moving, are you assuming that there\u2019s just offset there from some portfolio sales and FX? Just a little deeper on the revenue guide if you would please?","Andrew Power","Hey, Matt. Could you hear that answer to that last question?","Matthew Heinz","I couldn\u2019t hear it at all. We can follow-up offline.","Andrew Power","So in terms of the underwriting the second part of your question we\u2019re still believe in our underwriting of the 13 times EBITDA that we announced when we made the acquisition announcement last May. So nothing\u2019s changed in terms of outlook there and that\u2019s what\u2019s included in our revised guidance for 2016.","In terms of revenue it\u2019s really about the gain from a partially a period on the pre-portfolio has been offset by FX headwinds and revenue loss associated with the safety knee asset. And also the portfolio assets that we\u2019ve now closed on. So both of those disposed, we lose some revenue in the back half of the year and we have some ethics headwinds offsetting other revenue gains from the European portfolio. How that one do.","Matthew Heinz","That works just fine. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess two questions. Most have been asked and answered. First, Andy, maybe you could be a little bit more precise in terms of timing of the equity distribution from a share count perspective. Is it fair to assume, then, you\u2019ll issue for modeling purposes, the shares at September 30? Is that the way we should think about it in sort of going through and coming out with our FFO numbers? And then I guess my second question, I will come back actually for that if you could help me first?","Andrew Power","Sure. So the whole reason with the timing is really just the moving parts on the sources and uses and we didn\u2019t have 100% clarity when we were very able to close out for us to dispose and we think the safety need dispose will close shortly but it could be at the beginning of August could be at the end of August and we can repay that preferred debt till late summer anyways.","So what we did is we closed on the revolver short-term we used revolver closing the acquisition short-term. And then when all the dust settles on all these other uses of capital. We plan to pull down all if not all or substantial all of the equity which is 14.3 million shares including the over a lot option that was exercised. Probably I want say maybe probably before September 30 maybe the beginning of September is my guess when all the dust settles here?","Jonathan Schildkraut","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you know you said during your prepared comments, and Matt actually said in answering Colby\u2019s question that you guys were very selective in your choosing of customers and so I just wanted to know exactly what that meant. Does that mean that you\u2019re not taking the same customers as some of the other guys who are taking these hyper scale deals or that - I\u2019m not sure what that meant?","Andrew Power","I think just to clarify and I will let Matt clarify as well had some a counter. I don\u2019t think that we have lots of great customers over 2000 customers now could in our most recent acquisition. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re choosing customers that we don\u2019t want to do business with and I regard I think all of our customers are great and we want to continued more business and grow our customer base. I think it\u2019s making sure we pick our spots on the right opportunities.","So buildings on our campus or within are gateways that we can fill with the diversity of different take and small cloud service providers other parts of our smack vertical, IT service providers, corporate enterprise that all want to thrive and continue the growth space and there. We find that is a better opportunity to land versus it on the core market or outside the core market especially not going after a kind of one big swath of leasing slash capital and almost like single tenant build to suit opportunities. We think the former versus a lot us more attractive to what we put our capital.","Matthew Miszewski","And in Jonathan just real quick. I mean there\u2019s that there are a couple of places where we are being more selective moving forward. As you know from the most recent Investor Day our focus on serving enterprise customers through the channel is certainly one of those cases, which actually makes the terms that that those organizations except a little bit easier on us and make the economics a little bit better for us as well as for the end customers down the road.","The second piece is that the ecosystem development that we\u2019re undergoing right now will really drive who we pursue in terms of end target customers. We\u2019ve moved to a new account targeting solution that allows us to hit not just the top cloud service providers, not just the massive cloud service providers but really about 500 targeted accounts that we can focus on and then also focus on the channel. So that\u2019s the targeting that I was really referring to.","And the final piece is we do continue to have a great strategy of building up incredible campuses. And so we want to make sure that we have multi data center campus facility and so we need to attract those types of customers and I\u2019ll let Jarrett.","Jarrett Appleby","Yes. I think partnering up with the partner in Alliance Group there\u2019s a couple unique things. One having colocation now on the campus in Ashburn and Richardson next to the leading cloud service providers is high value we\u2019re seeing severely wins in that. We do need that service exchange that provides those new connectivity options.","And the second is we\u2019re getting multi-site deals in the ecosystems because we\u2019ve expanded our cage capability in many of the buildings that we own that Telx is in and that\u2019s now bringing more magnets in who bring their customer base in with them. So those are a big push that will have from our product and delivery.","And then finally with the new land we have acquired we\u2019re now using our new design and can design and delivery capability. Now in Greenfield campuses at even larger scale and so you\u2019re seeing that next generation of product in places like Ashburn and Dallas.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Choe","Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on a clarification. Given the EquitCiti asset probably is a little bit lower margin that the core business and it\u2019s staying in guidance, what gave you the confidence to raise up the guidance range for adjusted EBITDA to 56 to the 58?","Andrew Power","Hey, Richard this is Andy. Even with the absorption of - you\u2019re correct lower margin than existing digital. Based on the outperformance we\u2019ve seen on the EBITDA side or expense side year-to-date and what we\u2019re trending for the remainder of the year. We think we\u2019re going to be able to absorb that portfolio and continue to maintain - I should say deliver slightly higher than previously disclosed EBITDA margin. There is a little bit of an order of magnitude going on here with the portfolio being $900 million and relative to digital size.","Richard Choe","Makes sense. And then for the development CapEx guidance, it\u2019s been very light for the past few quarters. It seems like it really would have to accelerate to even get to the low end, let alone midpoint or high end. Is that the right way to think about that?","Andrew Power","On the development CapEx spend. I think you\u2019re right. We\u2019re probably if you look to those two goal posts we\u2019re probably close to the low end than the high end. But I won\u2019t put it out of reach yet. But I would say we\u2019re probably guide into a little bit on that spend towards the low end.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sumit Sharma","Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide more color on the four assets you sold. Just trying to get a sense of whether these were non-core or more on the opportunistic side of things given the low 6 cap rate. Any color you could provide would be really helpful?","Scott Peterson","Yes. Scott here. Yes, it\u2019s fair to determine or to call them non-core, St. Louis is a non-core secondary market, that asset was better placed in the hands of somebody pursuing that strategy. And then the two Northern Virginia assets, well that is a core market; those assets would not be considered core assets to our ongoing strategy.","Sumit Sharma","Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of the SS NOI guidance phase, the 2.5 or 3.5 on constant currency basis to 5, assuming there\u2019s 3% escalators on all of your rents, I guess there has to be somewhere in there that just seems pretty significant asking rent hike around the 10% range. Just trying to get a sense of what kind of asking rents are you seeing and who is driving that kind of thing?","Andrew Power","Sure. I would say - so our bumps are 2% to 3%, but not all 3% just to be clear. So I think the reason we really changed increased our same capital cash NOI growth. We\u2019re doing a little bit better on the retention. Doing a little bit better on a cash mark-to-market then from a quarter ago and that kind of translates into that kind of a 3 to 3.5 constant currency growth rate.","You are not - that space and there\u2019s a pretty demonstrative footnote at the top does not have the Telx colocation, mark-to-market really running through it, as we want to really reflect the true chain capital stabilized portfolio, so you\u2019re not getting the 5% plus mark-to-markets like we\u2019re seeing on the colo side yet. Next year we\u2019ll be in that pool, but right now this is just really retention and modest mark-to-market from the - are more of our scale leases expiring and for those and those 2% to 3% rate bumps and then managing the OpEx prudently.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for any closing remarks.","William Stein","Thank you, Dan. I\u2019d like to wrap up our call today by recapping our second quarter highlights as outlined here on Page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we further advanced our global footprint with the European portfolio acquisition. We also delivered solid current period financial results. We beat the Street by $0.04 with better than expected results above and below the NOI line.","We also delivered outsized AFFO per share growth during the quarter. The quality of our earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating. We raised guidance by $0.10 with an improving outlook for most of our key metrics and solid progress towards our three-year target of 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering that coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 index.","In conclusion, I\u2019d like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and have a great summer.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. I'm happy to report that Digital just completed another solid quarter, marked by strong execution against our core strategic objectives. I'd like to begin, as usual, with \"The Way Forward\" slide on page two of our earnings deck.","We continued to make progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital. And we achieved a 20-basis-point pickup during the second quarter, building upon the 100-basis-point improvement we delivered over the previous five quarters.","In terms of recycling capital, we realized a $77 million gain from the sale of one non-core property, and we are in active negotiations on several others. Scott Peterson will provide additional detail. As you know, we've put a great deal of effort into stabilizing the business and derisking the development pipeline over the past year and a half.","With respect to inventory management, we have reduced our finished inventory by nearly half since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our $630 million pipeline of active data center development projects is over 80% pre-leased at stabilized cash yields, just below the high end of our 10% to 12% target range.","From the current position, we believe we are in solid footing to pivot towards the next phases of growth for Digital Realty, particularly with the recent addition of several key executive-level hires, notably, including Andy Power, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry.","I'm very pleased with the progress that the entire Digital team has made on each of the strategic objectives spelled out here. But today, I'd like to focus, and I'm sure most of you will too, on the red call-out box highlighting innovative product offerings, colocation and ecosystem initiatives. As you are all aware, just two weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading national provider of colocation and interconnection data center solutions for $1.9 billion. We believe Telx fits squarely within the box in terms of our strategic priorities, and that is product offerings and geographic footprint are highly complementary to our current portfolio.","Page three really highlights the complementary nature of the transaction. Our existing business consists primarily of meeting the large footprint data center space and power requirements of creditworthy customers. Telx's colocation business is very similar, but in smaller increments to a far greater number of customers. Over time and in select environments, if a critical mass of customer concentration is achieved, an ecosystem may blossom, which is the necessary precursor to the interconnection business or the exchange of traffic within a data center.","As indicated by the bubbles on the right-hand column, interconnection represents nearly half of Telx's top line and has grown at a very healthy rate. It's important to understand here that by combining our businesses, we are creating an even more differentiated business model, with a strong, large footprint business and a solid, rapidly-growing colocation business within a truly interconnected network.","In essence, we are widening and deepening the economic moat between ourselves and our competitors. There are significant barriers to growing our portfolio of either a global large footprint platform or a colocation and interconnection business, but with all three under the same roof, we believe that the sum of the parts will truly be greater than the whole. In addition, the properties that make up the physical infrastructure are almost entirely owned by Digital.","This makes future growth that much more significant since we control our own real estate and the residual value from incremental growth opportunities accrues to us rather than a third-party landlord. In the long run, we believe this will further set us apart from our competitors in terms of products and services offered.","Now turning to slide four, we have consistently stated that our key acquisition criteria are focused on investments that are strategic and complementary to our existing business and also financially accretive and prudently financed.","We believe Telx checks all of those boxes. This deal makes strategic sense for several reasons: First, Telx is a leading colocation and interconnection business that is extremely complementary to our existing platform and is concentrated in top tier markets in the U.S. In addition, this deal allows us to obtain a robust and extremely difficult-to-replicate interconnection ecosystem in one fell swoop.","The combination also sets the stage for future upside from cost synergies, significant revenue synergies and embedded growth potential from expanding Telx's offering across our global portfolio and leasing up Telx's underutilized properties in our own backyard on the West Coast. And finally, we expect to achieve these benefits while enhancing our standalone growth trajectory and funding the transaction in a manner consistent with our leverage targets.","Our core competency remains providing space and power to our existing customer base. This acquisition allows us to broaden the range of customers and provide even more choice on an open carrier-neutral platform. The transaction will not fundamentally alter our relationship with our customers. But what it will do is provide them a one-stop shop where they pick and choose from the entire range of data center solutions that best fit their needs. That open platform is extremely compelling.","We are focused on serving the needs of our entire customer base from enterprise customers to strategic channel partners and managed service providers who sell through to corporate enterprise IT requirements. We have a unique opportunity to provide an open environment that gives our customers a choice of varying levels of redundancy, footprint size and connectivity options.","While this acquisition expands our product offering, we will, of course, remain true to our real estate roots. And we are keenly focused on maximizing the return on our existing asset base. We expect to drive higher returns on every square foot, on every kilowatt in our portfolio, by augmenting our existing product offering with a wider array of size, power and redundancy requirements and by bringing core interconnection networking capabilities to our data center campus environments around the world.","In some instances, this will mean partnering with customers to enable their managed services, thereby monetizing the tremendous value of our global footprint with minimal incremental costs. Our ability to do so is unique among data center providers. We will provide a full review of how we see Telx fitting into our strategy going forward at our Investor Day in Aspen now scheduled for October 6.","I look forward to seeing you all there. And now, I'll pass the call over to our Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson, for a deeper dive on our underwriting of the Telx acquisition.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Thank you, Bill. Picking up here on page five, I'd like to first highlight the attractive growth profile of this business. As you can see from this chart in the upper left quadrant, the top line has grown at over 20% compound annual growth rate and the interconnection business has grown even faster. The drivers have been volume growth along with pricing power as reflected in the charts on the bottom half of the page. We view the interconnection business as high growth and highly desirable with high barriers to entry.","Top-line growth has also historically translated to growth in cash flow as demonstrated by the core EBITDA time series in the upper right quadrant. I'd like to pause for a moment to focus on the absolute numbers in this chart and to clarify a few points here. For starters, I can tell you that we underwrote projected EBITDA of $148 million in 2016, which represents 11% growth from the $133 million run rate core EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter. I would like to point out that core EBITDA excludes $22 million of non-cash deferred rent expense paid to third-party landlords in 2016. The rent that Telx previously paid to Digital will be an intercompany elimination going forward. We do intend to run Telx as a standalone line of business reporting to Jarrett Appleby.","We also underwrote $15 million of cost synergies, primarily redundant corporate overhead, of which $10 million runs through the P&L and $5 million represents capitalized compensation costs. It is important to note that our $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA does not include any cost synergies. We also have not factored any revenue synergies into our near-term underwriting expectations, although we believe the longer-term revenue synergies could be quite meaningful.","The EBITDA multiple is in the eye of the beholder, but since the transaction is expected to close late this year, we view 2016 as the most appropriate time period, and on that basis, the transaction represents a multiple of a little less than 13 times. Taking synergies into account, the EBITDA multiple would be right around 12 times.","The next slide on page six has received quite a bit of attention. And I would like to clarify several points. This is intended to be an illustration of the embedded growth potential from leasing existing built colocation inventory and improving utilization rates at underutilized properties. It is not meant to tie to our 2016 EBITDA projection.","The concept behind this is simply raising the utilization rates for properties below 70% up to 70%, and properties below 80% up to 80% utilized, while leaving those above constant. The potential incremental revenue from reaching 70% and 80% utilization has been revised from $47 million and $75 million respectively to the $37 million and $65 million you see here on page six.","I would also like to point out that the properties shown here represent a subset of the Telx portfolio. If you tally up the number of properties shown in white at the bottom of the bars, you should arrive at 15 out of a total of 20. The utilization rate for all 15 of these properties is less than 80%. In fact, the average utilization for the 15 properties shown here is 57%.","Consequently, reaching 70% utilization would represent 1,300 basis points of lease-up on this subset and reaching 80% utilization would represent 2,300 basis points of lease-up. In term of our underwriting the $148 million of projected 2016 EBITDA, we've been discussing contemplates lease-up of the overall portfolio utilization rate from a current 68% to a little less than 79%.","Of course, that includes the five properties that are above 80% utilized and represents approximately 37,000 square feet of new leasing. The corresponding utilization rate on the subset of these 15 properties would be between 75% and 80%, when excluding the impact of potential expansion at these facilities.","Said differently, our 2016 underwriting essentially contemplates that we will achieve some but not all of the embedded growth potential represented on this slide. I would like to be clear about the corresponding capital investment. Reaching 70% utilization requires a capital investment of approximately $15 million, and reaching 80% would require an additional $25 million. Our 2016 underwriting includes roughly $45 million of expansion capital, which includes some CapEx to create additional inventory.","Separately, we have underwritten a little over $30 million of recurring capital spend in 2016, which we would deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO and which represents roughly 20% of EBITDA. I would like to point out that a significant portion represents capitalized leasing costs rather than physical maintenance CapEx.","The final point I'd like to make on this slide is to note that the empty sellable square footage within the Telx portfolio is somewhat analogous to a development pipeline in traditional real estate terms and really represents their finished inventory.","If you zero in on 60 Hudson, you will see that it represents most of the lease-up opportunity in the table on the right and you can see from the bar chart, it is currently 49% leased. However, almost all of the vacancy at 60 Hudson reflects expansion space taken down in January of this year. Prior to taking down that expansion space, 60 Hudson was 85% utilized.","Turning to the geographic overlap on page seven, Telx is headquartered in New York and has a very strong presence on the East Coast with leaseholds in three highly strategic Internet Gateway buildings in Lower Manhattan. Telx has a direct lease with the owner of 111 8th Avenue, the third largest building in Manhattan and one of the key Internet hubs on the East Coast. Digital also has a leasehold interest in 111 8th Avenue, and Telx in turn subleases a portion of this space from us.","In addition, we recently moved out of the property management office we kept at 111 8th Avenue, freeing up 3,000 square feet of prime inventory, which we expect the Telx sales force will be eager to begin market upon closing.","Based on Telx pricing of 111 8th Avenue, this represents a potential $3 million to $4 million of incremental EBITDA. Just to be clear, however, this is not included in the $148 million of EBITDA we had projected in 2016, although to be fair, neither is the $4 million of capital that would be required to build out this space.","Finally, as you can see from the summary performance statistics on the left-hand side of the page, the three West Coast properties are less than 50% leased. We see significant embedded growth potential from these underutilized properties in our backyard on the West Coast.","In addition to the upside from lease-up, we see significant opportunity to roll out the Telx platform across our global portfolio, particularly in our campus environment. As you can see from the overlapping logos at the top of page eight, Telx has an existing presence in our campuses in Chicago, Dallas, New York and Silicon Valley.","The overlap speaks to the complementary nature of the transaction, but the campus environments in Ashburn, London and Singapore, where you don't see a Telx logo, represent the most promising value proposition from the combination of the two platforms.","Turning to page nine, echoing Bill's points about our real estate roots and this deal being the best fit for Digital Realty, as you know, Telx leases 11 of its 20 properties from us. In addition, Telx owns the two properties pictured here on this page.","As a result, we will own outright over half of the real estate in this portfolio. The mix of owned versus leased real estate compares quite favorably relative to most other colocation businesses, and the overlap of Telx's footprint within the envelope of our buildings should help mitigate integration risk, especially relative to the underwriting risk of the unknown in a typical arm's length transaction.","The customer data on the next page clearly demonstrate that Telx has effectively achieved a robust interconnection ecosystem within its portfolio. Telx is a well-diversified customer base with over 1,250 customers of whom more than 80% are connectivity-centric from within the telecom, cloud and IT verticals. In addition, while Telx's customer contracts tend to be shorter duration than our traditional lease terms, the stickiness of the customer base is highlighted by the average customer relationship of over nine years.","Page 11 underscores the strategic fit by demonstrating the impact of the transaction on our existing book of business. We have publicly articulated a goal of doubling the top-line contribution from our colocation business and the Telx transaction accomplishes this objective. The combination of Digital Realty's global, large foot data center platform with Telx's robust colocation business will open avenues of growth for well over 1,000 combined customers worldwide.","As outlined on page 12, the new combined entity will have enhanced scale, a diversified product mix and a stronger growth profile. Pro forma enterprise value is expected to be approximately $17 billion, and the business mix will be a little over three-quarters large footprint data center, 14% colocation, and 9% interconnection.","Turning briefly to capital recycling, we closed on the previously announced sale of 833 Chestnut Street for $161 million or $228 per square foot at a 5.8% cap rate on 2015 budgeted cash NOI. The sales generated net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we recognized a $77 million gain in the second quarter.","We also brought a portfolio of five non-core data centers to market during the second quarter and we have recently begun fielding initial bids. We are actively marketing an additional three assets for sale, which are currently in various stages of negotiation.","We also signed a key long-term lease renewal with a single tenant in a non-core office building during the second quarter and we will likely begin marketing this property for sale at year end if the tenant does not exercise its six-month purchase option.","We also acquired a redevelopment project in Singapore for $45 million. Construction on the redevelopment project is already underway and we expect to deliver the first three Turn-Key Flex data center suites by early next year.","Finally, we also acquired a small land parcel in Melbourne adjacent to our existing park for approximately $2 million, although future development on this site will be subject to market conditions. We continue to believe that minimizing speculative development risk translates to healthier data center fundamentals and better returns for our shareholders. However, we are also mindful of our customers' growth needs and we are proactively investing to support their growth, particularly on our campus environments in core markets.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current data center leasing environment.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 14, we signed new leases representing a little over $37 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 80% of our second quarter lease signings. Existing customers represented just over 90% of our second quarter leasing activity, and we added 16 new logos in the quarter, bringing the full-year total to 35.","Our colocation segment contributed $3.7 million or 10% of our second quarter leasing activity. This was at the low end of the segment's recent quarterly run rate, largely reflecting the success we have had supporting the growth of existing colocation customers and some larger footprint requirements of greater than 300 kilowatts. You may recall that earlier this year, we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts, to better align our sales force with our customers.","We haven't traditionally called out colocation re-leasing spreads in our earnings, but it is worth noting that the mark-to-market on colo renewal leases was up 10% on a cash basis during the quarter, and re-leasing spreads were positive on over 90% of the colocation deals we executed during the second quarter.","We commenced leases totaling $65 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter, a record high for lease commencements. The backlog came down by roughly $30 million as a result from $104 million last quarter to $73 million currently, which you can see reflected in the chart on the top half of page 15. The weighted average lag between signings and commencements also reached a record during the second quarter at 2.5 months, as shown in the chart on the bottom half of the page.","Turning to page 16, cash re-leasing spreads were positive on Turn-Key as well as Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We still have a few above-market leases scattered throughout the portfolio, but the overall mark-to-market continues to steadily improve as market rents are on the upswing and we are gradually cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","We leased a total of 21 megawatts during the second quarter, more than offsetting deliveries and explorations and generating 3 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool.","As Bill mentioned and as you can see from the chart on page 17, the finished inventory balance is down by nearly half since our last Investor Day in November 2013. We remain keenly focused on maximizing the utilization of our existing asset base, but we are also taking steps to be in position to support our customers' future growth requirements, particularly on campus environments in core markets. In addition to our land bank, our investment in shelf space enables us to move quickly in response to demand and meet our customers' needs.","Turning now to supply on Page 18, the positive net absorption we have registered in our own portfolio has been mirrored in most major markets. As you can see, Houston is the only major market that registered any meaningful uptick in new supply over the last 90 days.","As you may recall, we have limited exposure to Houston at less than 2% of total NOI. In contrast, Dallas and Phoenix, where we do have a more meaningful presence, both tightened noticeably during the second quarter. Face rates have yet to register significant improvement, but the supply situation remains rational in virtually all major markets. Data center demand remains robust, concession packages are firming and net effective leasing economics are continuing to trend in the landlord's direction.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Matt. We reported 2Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.30, $0.05 ahead of consensus estimates. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of several factors including: $0.02 from successful property tax appeal in the Central Region and the reversal of a property tax accrual due to the lapse of a statute of limitations in the West Region, $0.02 from the early commencement of several large leases upon completion of all landlord obligations and transfer to tenant control during the second quarter, and roughly $0.01 from delayed timing of property operating expenses, asset sales and a somewhat lighter foreign currency headwind.","As shown on the next page, however, FX represented roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. In terms of operating performance, portfolio occupancy improved 140 basis points sequentially to 93.5% and same-capital occupancy ticked up 10 basis points sequentially to 94.8%.","As a reminder, we do expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the third quarter due to a couple of known Powered Base Building move-outs in the Bay Area, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. As Matt noted in his remarks, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for both Turn-Key and Powered Base Building renewals during the second quarter. We've revised our full year forecast from slightly negative to slightly positive and we are encouraged by the gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio.","As shown on page 20, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.8% in the second quarter, squarely in the middle of our 2% to 4% guidance range. However, it is worth pointing out that on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would be up 5.5%. For the full year, we now expect organic growth to trend towards the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis.","I would point out that Net Data Centers, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, is a tenant at two of our properties in LA. They remain current on all post-petition obligations and have until September 21 to accept or reject their leases with us or to request an extension of this deadline. While Net Data Centers is still in the process of evaluating its options in future operations, we remain comfortable with our position.","Turning now to the balance sheet on page 21, debt-to-EBITDA stood at five times at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter and roughly a half turn below our 5.5 times target. As you know, we executed a forward equity offering the week before last to fund a portion of the Telx acquisition. Upon fiscal settlement, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $685 million.","I would like to take just a moment to discuss the forward sales agreements. In the interest of time, I won't dwell on mechanics here, but I would like to point out that we have included a slide here on Page 22 that does provide some detail on the mechanics for those who may be interested.","I would also like to reiterate that the public offering was executed by forward sales agreements for deal structure purposes. Acquiring Telx at the REIT level rather than the operating partnership level was the most efficient structure. And we were able to facilitate that structure by selling common stock through forward sale agreements. It's also worth noting that the public offering has occurred, that we've locked-in the pricing at $68 per share and net proceeds approximately $685 million, subject only to adjustments for interest and dividends paid and the forward structure does not represent an overhang on our stock.","Several of the underwriters borrowed the stock from securities lenders to sell to the equity offering participants. And when the forward sale agreements are physically settled, those underwriters will simply deliver proceeds to the company in exchange for newly issued shares. To be clear, the newly issued shares will not be issued to the public. The shares will be issued to the participating underwriters who will then return the shares to the securities lenders from whom they were borrowed in connection with the public offering.","Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to briefly address guidance as well as the financial impact of the Telx transaction which we expect to close later this year.","As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising core FFO per share guidance by $0.02. A portion of the beat during the quarter is essentially timing-related, particularly asset sales which we still expect to execute and property operating expenses, which we still expect to incur.","Similarly, the property tax reversals during the second quarter were one-time in nature. In addition, G&A is trending higher than we previously expected. We also upped the long-term debt issuance assumption in our guidance from roughly $300 million to $700 million, up to $500 million to $1 billion.","While we will incur additional capital carry costs, which will depress earnings in the short run, we believe it is proven to lock in long-term capital, particularly in a rising rate environment. I would also like to point out that our guidance remains standalone for Digital-only and does not include any financial impact from Telx.","With regard to Telx, we tend to round out our financing for the transaction with a combination of preferred equity and bonds. We expect the Telx acquisition to be roughly 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016 and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share.","We realize we've run long today. So, we'll save Bill's closing remarks for the end of the call. And we'll now open up the lines to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","The first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. So I guess this is my first question, Bill, you mentioned the additional uptick in ROIC by 20 basis points after last quarter's more sizeable gain, which means we're probably pushing double-digits now. How should we think about the upside going forward and do you think this metric might plateau a bit from here?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we're actually in the low 9%s with that. We were at 8% and I think we're now at \u2013 if my math is right in my head, about 9.2% \u2013 9.5%. John's giving me the 9.5% sign here.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, pushing 10%.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Pushing 10%. That's right. And obviously, we think that the Telx deal will be [audio skip] (33:31) for the long haul.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as my follow-up, I think there was mention of cycling through the peak vintage expirations now. Could you add any granularity there around the vintage of leases rolling off these days, how many are from the recession era and how might that play into the mark-to-mark pricing strength that you expect going forward?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","We would have to get back to you with that precise data. We don't have that right at hand.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Slide 18 gives an interesting overview of the supply dynamic \u2013 supply-demand dynamic. And I wondered if you could qualitatively round out the picture of how you would characterize Europe as well as Asia-Pac. And then my follow-up is just related to the CapEx that you talked about associated with filling up the Telx inventory, the $15 million and the $25 million, I didn't quite understand what that consists of. Is that sales CapEx, meaning cabinets and cages or were there other factors in there? Thank you.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","So, thanks Jonathan for the question. In terms of supply and demand dynamics in Europe and APAC, we're looking at supply and demand dynamics that are roughly equivalent to the report out that we gave last quarter in terms of the supply. The supply characteristics in London remain in balance for us. And we feel that we've got sufficient supply for us to hit the demand on both our Crawley campus in terms of land bank that we've got, as well as shell that we've got available to us in our Woking campus, as well. We continue to have significant supply available to us in land bank in Amsterdam in Europe. And in Asia-Pacific, as Scott mentioned, we recently closed on an acquisition in Asia-Pacific in Singapore, so we continue to have a considerable amount of supply to hit the needs for the demand in that region, as well.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","And then on the CapEx side, Jonathan, yeah, that consists of cabinets, cages, installation expenses and commissions (36:08) those sorts of things.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jon Petersen - Jefferies","Great, thank you. I wanted to ask about the development pipeline, the size of it's down about $100ish million from where it was last quarter. Just curious about the conscious decision ahead of the Telx acquisition, just trying to kind of save capital, or whether that's you guys being more conservative than just a lack of opportunities for new development.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey John, this is Andy Power. I can speak to that a little bit. I don't think this was anything about saving capital. We kind of looked at funding the Telx acquisition on to itself and have laid out now the equity done and we'll look to go do preferred and bonds in the latter half of the year. Sitting on the Investment Committee over the last three months as a new participant, I think it's just been very focused on getting the timing of our investment as lined up as close to our \u2013 where we see demand. I don't think there was a purpose kind of preservation or capital there.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes, Jonathan, this is Matt. In terms of development pipeline that we've got, you'll notice that we've got about 80% pre-leased in terms of developments that are happening, and we've experienced a great amount of participation in terms of reacting to demand with our just-in-time development. So we think that's working well in our favor.","Jon Petersen - Jefferies","Okay. And then in terms of Telx, I'm kind of curious about the mechanics of integrating that portfolio with, I guess, some of your colocation properties is what makes the most sense. So I guess you could use maybe like 365 Main St as an example. I assume you'll be taking the Telx brand and infrastructure into a facility like that. And so, l guess, the process of doing that and realizing the revenue synergies, is it just buying dark fiber between that and the Telx facility? I'm just kind of \u2013 if you could just kind of explain how you go about integrating the Telx platform, kind of maybe you can quantify what the revenue synergies might be.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","So, first of all, a great question. First of all, we're treating it as a line of business, both as an asset or a campus, tethered into our campuses, taking their interconnection hub and connecting it to our data center campuses. And because of the prior relationship as they were a client of ours, we have that already set up in most of the markets out there. So our first stage is connecting that.","The second is we've looked at the assets as a combined entity, as a line of business for the product. So for colocation and interconnection products, we want to integrate that, all our legacy colocation properties into the portfolio and productize it. And then we're going to leverage the product expertise they have in colocation and go to market around that and the interconnection and networking services. So the first step is give them basically our capability, integrate it, and then we want to launch it as we were saying on a worldwide basis in the major markets where we can add colocation to their portfolio.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","All right. Good evening, thanks for taking the questions and also thanks for all of that additional disclosure on Telx in the presentation today. It was very helpful. I'd like to ask just about the progress really with your sort of top customers, certainly noticed that the top 20 customer list moved quite a bit, but really saw a lot of progress with some big names here, IBM, which has been sort of continued success story for you, but also LinkedIn and Oracle. I was wondering if you might provide some additional color as to what's going on with some of those big customers. Thanks.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah, Jonathan, this is Matt. Thanks so much for the question. And my team in particular looks at moving amongst those top 20 with great interest as well. We're thrilled to have IBM at the top of the list and, in particular, with regard to the workloads that we're landing with them. I talked a little bit in my prepared statements about the continued persistence of the SMACC-oriented workloads and movement amongst the top 20 is really sort of testament to the ability of Digital's great operational team to be able to provide solutions that match the needs of those SMACC workloads.","IBM is a great example of that. A good deal of those workloads happen to be soft layer-oriented public cloud. Oracle also was very happy to break itself into the top 20 this quarter with their public cloud offerings as well. And on the social side, we continued to expand our presence with LinkedIn.","What's great about these particular types of clients, Jonathan, is not that we get one-time wins with them, but they have a tendency to be repeat hitters and continue to grow with us, not just in one location, but in all of our portfolio assets throughout the world. So it's a great win for Digital.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. And as a follow-up, I'd love for you to maybe give us a little sense as to how we could connect some of the big cloud players you have in terms of the Digital portfolio of customers into the Telx business. You know, one of the numbers that really jumped out was sort of the very limited penetration Telx has to-date in terms of the cloud vertical for their revenue base. I think it was 8%. So I'd be interested to hear how you can match up sort of the Telx asset and value proposition with some of the core customers that you have in your base.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah, Jonathan. Great. It really was sort of, again, testament to the combination of these two organizations making a heck of a lot of sense. Our ability to connect the cloud workloads that we've got in terms of IC core with Telx interconnectivity is absolutely incredible.","So if you look at the number, the number of customers that we'll now be able to work together with, over 1,200 customers, to take from Telx's facilities, connect them into our cloud workload, it sort of reminds folks of several of the things I've said on a number of the past earnings calls, which is the hybrid cloud environment and connecting those cloud instances with enterprises is the magic that Digital can bring. And now Digital can bring it faster and better with the combination of Telx.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","And just a bit on two concrete examples of that. If you take their network strength, Jonathan, in markets like Ashburn and Dallas, where we traditionally have folks connecting through other locations into our sites, we're going to go directly and offer that product directly into our sites into the cloud compute engines. So you get the power of what we have in power and compute engines directly connecting into our sites.","Operator","The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Two, if I may. So like Jonathan, just really appreciate the information you guys provided on Telx. Very helpful. I guess, to that point, seems like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit to simply increase the utilization rates within Telx's current facilities and then, perhaps, leveraging off of some of DLR's facilities in those same markets.","But when do you think you'd be ready to actually expand the Telx presence internationally? It seems like that's a really big opportunity when you could actually bring it into some of the markets that you're already in, in areas like Europe and in Asia.","And then my second question, just more to the guidance. I was wondering if you could just talk about the pacing of speculative leasing. I see that it obviously increased another $10 million in terms of what you're able to write off in the second quarter. But how does that compare to what your expectations were going into this year? Thanks.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Colby, I'll take the first one on global expansion. We are looking to expand globally really in early 2016. Some of the markets that we outlined there as Phase I, London and Singapore and Dublin, are low-hanging fruit for us. And we're doing development projects in other markets. In every single data center campus now, we're building our colocation and interconnection capabilities. So you'll see that expansion start in 2016.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. And, Colby, just really quick on your second one and I'll turn it over to Andy, too. Recall that we raised guidance on leasing last quarter, and we feel real good about the remainder of the year.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Not much more to add to that, Colby. We're on track.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Good evening, guys. Maybe to elaborate a little bit on the sales cycle, I think if I was reading through the release right, two and a half months maybe was the average commencement time between signings and actual commencement. So, I don't know if that was a mix issue or you're just seeing kind of greater demand coming through faster? Any color would be helpful.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. Dave, so in terms \u2013 we've had a focus on reducing the gap from book-to-bill for some time. And we certainly think we've gotten to a sweet spot. I think that the 2.5-months gap is a little bit of a mix of customers in this particular quarter. I wouldn't suggest that the 2.5 months will stay that way ongoing, but we should be in a sweet spot in that 2.5-month to three-month range.","Dave B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe Andy or Bill, maybe talk a little bit about leverage and the idea of \u2013 I know you issued the equity, but not taking leverage down a little further using the growth profile of Telx here as an excuse to maybe delever and move a little faster on that side of the equation. So thoughts about the asset sale plan and leverage overall would be helpful.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Dave, this is Andy speaking. We feel quite comfortable now that we've got the $700 million approximately of equity off, pro forma for the Telx acquisition, which will likely close later in the year, we are below our 5.5 times target. Based on some of the things we've already said, we do think we're buying a very attractive business with some embedded growth in it. So it spurs some of the EBITDA which will bring us down, as well. But we think the balance sheet remains positioned for growth pro forma for the equity we just raised.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to go back to the accretion that you talk about for Telx, the 1% on FFO, 3% for AFFO. I just wanted to clarify because you talked about a lot of different ways you can check value here, but do those numbers include any of the synergies you talked about on the cost side, the $15 million, and that presumably doesn't include the revenue synergies, but just wanted to clarify on the cost side.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Vin. The synergies that we've underwritten, the 1% and 3% to FFO and AFFO respectively, they include roughly $15 million of expense synergies, of which roughly $10 million flows through our P&L. The other $5 million is really the capitalized items. They do not include any revenue synergies. While we think the revenue synergies could be quite significant as we've already discussed, we have not included them in our underwriting for 2016 financial impact.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the sales force at Telx there, and I know there is going to be some folks leaving at the sort of the executive level. But since the deal has been announced, have you had discussions with some of the key sales guys there and have any sense about what the, you know, turnover might look like as a result of the deal?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","This is Jarrett, they're a highly qualified team. They're very focused on their community, you know, 95% of it is in five vertical segments. Matt and I are totally aligned on, you know, going after and retaining the top talent and they seem very interested.","We're going to give them a heck of a lot to sell. It's going to be a global platform and leveraging the relationships of 1,250 customers now worldwide and also giving them capabilities that only Digital can bring in that community. So, I think the leverage of the two is very, very [audio skip] (48:58).","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. Vin, we've had a great relationship, as you know, with Telx as one of our major customers and with the leadership over there being so ingrained with ours over here, we had a great relationship in the past and we look forward to continuing that relationship a little more directly in the future.","Operator","The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, thank you. Bill, one for you on this deal being a sizeable M&A transaction, particularly, the largest transaction you're overseeing since you're sitting in the CEO chair. It's easy to see the success we're seeing in the colocation and interconnection businesses in particular, and how sort of layering that up over the DLR platform would make sense intuitively.","But you're also buying from a private equity smart seller, if you will. And my question is really how do you mitigate the downside? I mean, I want to straight-line the growth here up into the right, like everybody else. But I also want to understand how do you mitigate the downside risk in sort of the near-term to intermediate-term?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Well, that was obviously all part of the underwriting process. One of the things we looked at was the churn that Telx had. And it was \u2013 their customers are incredibly sticky at roughly 0.6%. And the average life of their customers is over nine years. So, while the contract duration is short compared to ours, their customers do stay with them, and that was an important piece of our underwriting in terms of looking at potential downside.","We've also \u2013 I mean, Matt mentioned that the re-leasing spreads on our colo business were up 10% this last quarter, and that gives us some encouragement as well in terms of how to underwrite the rents on this business. We'd underwrite them as up 10%, I think we underwrote them \u2013 I'm looking at Scott here, probably flat. But \u2013 he's nodding. But the point is, we're seeing a lot of demand in the colo business and pressure on rents.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","And I think I would add to that, at a 68.5% utilization rate, all we have to do to protect the downside is maintain that. We have an awful lot of potential growth if we just fill up the space that's already built and available.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. And Jordan, we see our customers coming to us with a multiplicity of demands and now we're able to hit them together. So, I know it's been said before in M&A transactions, but combination of Telx and Digital is better together. We think that the value we are able to hit as one organization will increase the value to our customers and that we'll capture that value here at Digital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And just as a follow-up to that, in terms of reporting structure, I think I heard that Jarrett, you'd be heading up the, I don't know, if with the integration or just heading up sort of the Telx within Digital. But does that include the sales effort or is that going to be managed by Matt?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, that will include the sales effort. Matt and I are coordinating how to support global accounts. He's got some tremendous relationships. We're working through that process right now. But it is a line of business, and we want to build out the product, keep a focus on those clients and keep serving them, and I think bringing in additional assets into that portfolio capability.","Operator","The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good evening guys. Scott, I think when we were going through the slide deck, you had mentioned that the numbers on page six had come down from when you had previously given them. Was there a specific driver that would bring those potential incremental revenue numbers down?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","No, nothing changed. It was in the heat of pulling everything together quickly, there was an error in the sheet, and so it was just \u2013 it was a mistake in the numbers.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then maybe more broadly on strategy, how do you manage the challenge of now offering extremely similar product to what a lot of your customers are offering, sort of a different position than this company has ever been in before?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Well, first, in terms of commitment, we are really focused on serving many of the same clients. We're very focused on the service provider community and strategic channel partners. What we didn't want to do is pivot our company in a heavy enterprise direct focus. So, we've aligned with Matt and the Telx team on really selling through and supporting their strategic channel partnerships. Colocation is very complementary to support the ecosystem, and folks need smaller footprint, so we needed the product and service capability there. But you won't see us getting in the line of business like others, moving into the managed service phase and competing with our customers.","Operator","Your next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Is all of Telx's earnings going to be considered good REIT income, and are you planning on pursuing a private letter ruling to confirm what your beliefs are?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, Telx has roughly 49% or 47% from colocation, equal parts from interconnection. The colocation is clear good REIT income, as is the interconnection, and we already have a private letter ruling for the interconnection. There's a small percentage of income, really fees paid on the installations that represents a couple percentages of the revenue that will have housing our TRS and offset by expenses at the TRS to minimize any tax leakage.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to confirm the financing. Your revised guidance in your supplemental talks about a $500 million to $1 billion unsecured debt deal in the second half of this year. Is that independent of the additional what, call it, upwards of $1 billion of bonds you were going to issue to help finance Telx?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So the page in our supplemental, that far right column, that is Digital-only, it has no capital or operating assumptions related to Telx. So essentially, we decided to increase our guidance by roughly $250 million at the midpoint. That incremental debt raised will be used to repay our revolver and hence we'll have a lower revolver balance and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt by the end of the year. As it relates to Telx, separate from what's on the page, the plan is the same. We've completed the roughly $700 million of equity that will close concurrent with the closing of the acquisition. The remainder will be funded with a combination of preferred equity and investment grade bonds.","Operator","The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Hi, guys. I don't know if I missed this in any of the disclosures you've already released. But for 111 8th Ave, are you able to share the terms of Telx's lease or leases with Google? How much remaining term do you have? How do you view your process of retaining that space long term?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think we have that in the disclosure, but I believe with extensions in 111 8th Ave, it's roughly 10 years remaining.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Have you guys spoken to Google even for your own space, do they seem amenable to renewing those leases or is that a 10-year life there?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","We haven't gone out and try to extend it as part of this process. We made sure we're good from an assumption basis. As we move closer to that expiration, we'll obviously have to evaluate that with Google. And I think Matt has something....","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes. So Jon, we had had some conversations with Google when they had an interest in expanding their presence inside Manhattan. They've done that in an alternative way, so they may be a little bit more open to the conversation than they were, say, a year and a half ago.","Operator","And the next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up to a previous question. But I'm interested in how you're thinking about the, I guess, the \u2013 how leverageable the existing Telx sales force is, as we think about expanding the focus to other Digital markets and how we should think about any sort of incremental sales investments there? And then second, maybe for Matt, I'm wondering if you could just talk about what the initial customer response has been to the Telx announcement and any kind of initial impact that's had on the pipeline so far, I guess, if at all. Thanks.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah, happy to answer both of those, Stephen, and if Jarrett's got some extra color, he'd be happy to add that as well. Interesting, inside the sales force at Telx, while they've been primarily a domestic organization right now, they do have an awful lot of sellers with international experience. So, we're excited about that because our intention is to take the incredible assets that Telx has and expand them, expand them internationally. And so, it's good to have some more talent.","The second thing is that their vertically oriented sales force is not a regionally \u2013 only a regionally experienced sales force, so we'll be able to take that vertical experience and apply it across multiple regions both in North America as well as worldwide. Customer reaction has been fantastic. And in fact we're trying hard to keep everyone calm as we're getting towards the actual closing of the deal because people are interested in having lots and lots of conversations that we're not having until the deal closes, but I can tell you that the customer response has been fantastic.","Operator","Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Bill, maybe we can follow up on the ROIC question from earlier. So, you're running at around, lets call it, 9% for phrase in (59:56) numbers, you're buying Telx at a 12 times or 13 times multiple. And I think your comment was that ROIC would actually go up on that? Maybe I'm just confused somewhere, but it doesn't seem like the math works.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey Manny, this is Andy. I can jump in and help on this. So, we're at 9.3% kind of our NOI, our cash NOI over our total gross investment book value, at first quarter, 9.5% second quarter, that's NOI, not EBITDA. When you look at our underwritten EBITDA, which we've kind of put out there of $148 million and you add back the G&A which you can get from looking at the pro forma that was in our filed 8-K, we see that investment closer to, I think, definitely north of where that 9.5%, so we see it slightly accretive to our existing return on investment.","But, again, the other piece of it is we're not buying the stabilized portfolio as well, like when we deliver a development at 10% to 12%, and it's pretty much fully leased. We're buying a business which still have embedded growth and additional cash and upside to continue to grow that return on investment from the initial 20 assets in the portfolio.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks, Andy.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","That makes sense?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","It does. Matt, just a quick question for you on backlog. So looks like you've had the numbers in 2016 and 2017 come down. Were those just commencing earlier? Why would the backlog numbers, especially in 2017, come down at this point in time?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Manny, this is Andy again. I'm getting a lot of points (1:01:38) handed off to me today, maybe this is my \u2013 because this is my first call. We had some \u2013 as part of the script, we had some early commencements. I think two tenants took \u2013 we've completed space, finished all of our landlord1 work, and we handed over the space and they took over possession early.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","But I still love you, Manny.","Operator","The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could run us through the puts and takes of the Telx EBITDA margin and where you see the most incremental cost synergies being unlocked and how we can think about that margin as you subsequently scale the business. And then I have one more after that.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. This is Andy. So, I think the best place to start -- you can look at our pro forma that has the incremental EBITDA or you can take the core EBITDA from the 8-K and divide it by the revenue start.","Obviously, on paper, the margin is going to look better because part of leases associated with their space to us get eliminated upon the transaction closing. I think we have to think about increments to it. First piece is the underwriting expense synergies, $10 million of the $15 million will flow through the P&L, so that will obviously be incremental margin enhancement off the bat. We're underwriting to deliver those for a full-year 2016 impact, so we'll work through our execution on achieving that through the end of the year and have that in place for a full year by \u2013 come December.","And then on top of that, I think that there will be pretty high flow-through revenue contribution as we lease up what we see as an underutilized portfolio that has a significant amount of recently delivered space, and also as we kind of put to work some of Digital's talented team assisting on some of the West Coast assets as well. I don't have a number for you right there because we really \u2013 we haven't, in our underwriting, put a firm revenue synergy, but I think that will have a contribution to the margin as well.","Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you for that color. And my second question was, can you provide some commentary surrounding the pace and the success of the capital recycling program to date? And more specifically, how we should think about the impact of capital recycling in the second half of 2015 versus 2016?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","So, I think the pace has been on target. It's been a little slower in some areas because we've pursued some value-add opportunities on a number of these projects, which are now coming to fruition; we've seen a lot of benefit on that. The Kato Road building that we leased up 100% is a good example of that. And the lease extension that we just signed for the single-tenant office building is another great example of that.","So, it's taken a little longer, but I think the benefit to our shareholders has been very significant. I think what you'll probably see is that the remainder of the assets will largely be executed by the end of the year from the sales perspective.","Operator","And our final question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Great. Thanks. To the extent that you guys looked at Telx on an asset-by-asset basis, are you able to share what kind of cap rate or EBITDA multiple you assigned to the portfolio's key assets, specifically 56 Marietta Street, 60 Hudson Street and 111 8th Avenue?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. We didn't really look at it. I mean, we do look at it on an asset-by-asset basis, but we don't really do a full valuation on an asset-by-asset basis. We do projections, rollups for every asset in terms of generating our revenue and EBITDA projects. But we didn't really do a full analysis on each one. I will tell you on Marietta, though, we did spend a little time thinking of what the potential value of that asset might be. And you can get a very interesting array of outcomes on that, and some of which are quite impressive, to be honest with you.","And hey, Jon, by the way, I want to get back to you on the 111 8th Avenue lease for Telx. It has an expiration date of 2022 with two five-year renewal options on it. So that takes you out to 2032 there.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our second quarter 2015 highlights, as highlighted on page 23 of the deck. First and foremost, we picked up another 20 basis points of sequential improvement in our return on invested capital, following the 100 basis points we've delivered over the past five quarters. We tightened the commencement lag from 3.7 months in the first quarter to an exceptional two and a half months.","The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt-to-EBITDA at five times. We beat the second quarter consensus estimates by $0.05, and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance from $5.03 to $5.13 range to $5.05 to $5.15. Finally, we made the exciting announcement entering into an agreement to acquire Telx, a leading provider of colocation, interconnection and cloud-enabling services.","In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe we have a unique and competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders.","I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind all of you to mark October 6 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day. Thank you all for taking the time to participate in today's call. That concludes our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded.

Such forward-looking statements include statements related to the company's future financial and other results, including 2014 guidance and the underlying assumptions.

Management's prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session.","[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you, all, for joining us. I'd like to start today by providing a quick update on the progress that we've made toward the strategic initiatives we laid out 6 months ago. These are highlighted on Page 2 of our presentation.","First, we made continued headway on leasing up our existing inventory during the third quarter. We have, likewise, made steady progress towards our top priority of driving improved return on invested capital, which is up 30 basis points over the last year. With respect to our capital recycling initiative, we took the first tangible steps towards pruning the portfolio to narrow our focus on the core. We also closed a significant turnkey data center joint venture transaction during the third quarter.","Our capital recycling program is designed to refocus our geographic footprint and enhance the consistency of our product quality. This program will set the stage for a faster, more sustainable pace of growth in 2016 and beyond even if it does create somewhat of a headwind to earnings growth next year. If we have to choose between long-term value creation or near-term growth in FFO per share, we will choose the former. We plan to exit several secondary markets, but we've also identified a handful of select global markets, notably in Germany and Japan, where our customers would like us to have a presence. We plan to enter these markets with our customers over time.","Scott Peterson will cover our capital recycling efforts in his remarks. But suffice to say that we believe capital is precious, and at current pricing, we view the equity embedded within our existing portfolio as a better source of capital than the public equity capital markets. In addition to refining our focus, we expect our capital recycling initiative will also drive tighter utilization of our asset base and will, likewise, contribute to improvement in our overall return on invested capital.","Turning to our Global Alliances Program. We recently announced a joint marketing alliance with VMware and agreement with Carpathia to make our respective product offerings directly available to each other's sellers. In addition, we're in the process of significantly expanding the number of cloud service providers participating in our global cloud marketplace. Our enterprise customer base is accelerating their adoption of the hybrid cloud model. Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable our customers' needs by facilitating direct access to large and growing cloud service provider network within our portfolio.","Existing customers accounted for almost 90% of our third quarter lease signings, but we have also added nearly 80 new logos year-to-date. These have included multiple instances of cloud production for a global software powerhouse currently servicing over 400,000 customers and one of the world's largest enterprise software providers currently serving clients in over 130 countries by supporting their cloud platform.","Moving on to inventory management. As discussed, we are committed to a much more disciplined approach with respect to development risk going forward. We have primarily transitioned to a build-to-order inventory management program. As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on Page 30 of our sup [ph], our active data center construction projects are now 86% pre-leased.","With progress against these initiatives in mind, I'd like to take a moment to share with you why I believe we have such a durable business. For starters, we have a world-class roster of customers with excellent credit. These customers tend to sign relatively long-term leases. They typically make a significant investment of their own capital within our facilities, and as a result, they have a high propensity to renew their leases at expiration. Our top 50 customers account for roughly 70% of our NOI. This level of concentration allows for diversification, but it also tips the 80\/20 principle scale, contributing to a comparatively low cost of sale and a less operationally intensive business model.","These attributes underscore the stability of our cash flow stream, which has earned us the lowest cost of capital in the sector, supported by the residual value of our real estate. We've also been able to attract and retain a base of incredibly talented and hardworking employees from around the world, whose skills and dedication would be nearly impossible to replicate by any competitor and thus represents an important source of competitive advantage. In short, we are confident in our competitive position.","Over the next 3 to 5 years, we plan to strengthen our position by driving greater profitability per unit through our existing footprint. In addition to emphasizing asset utilization, we aim to drive additional revenue through capturing a greater share of customer wallet via product diversification, exploiting opportunities for open and paid peering and driving the pairing of cloud service providers with our large enterprise clients.","Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on Page 3 of the presentation. As you are surely aware, geopolitical uncertainty has risen over the last several months, while the outlook for global GDP growth has slipped a bit. In contrast, the U.S. economy has remained relatively resilient, although growth has been modest. Data center demand is not directly linked to the price of oil or to U.S. payrolls but is secular in nature and is growing faster than GDP. In addition, supply is being consistently absorbed at the sector level, and we expect continued gradual improvement in data center fundamentals.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.","Scott E. Peterson","Thank you, Bill. As shown here on Page 4, we closed a $187.6 million joint venture during the third quarter with Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT for a turnkey data center located in Ashburn, Virginia. We sold an 80% interest to Griffin Capital, and we retained a 20% interest in the joint venture. We will continue to manage the property and receive management fees. The transaction valued the property at a 7.05% cap rate or $20,600 per kilowatt. We're pleased with this transaction, as it provides meaningful price discovery for turnkey data centers and establishes a new capital partner relationship.","On last quarter's call, we indicated we would begin marketing non-core assets for sale shortly after Labor Day. We have identified an initial pool of 9 properties for disposition. As detailed in our press release, we brought 5 of these assets to market, and we booked a $13 million impairment charge during the third quarter to write down 2 of those assets to their estimated fair market value.","Leasing activity at the 4 remaining properties has picked up considerably over the past 90 days, and we are in the process of finalizing some new leases, which has affected the timing of bringing these properties to market. However, this should increase the value of these properties and maximize proceeds to our shareholders. In addition, several of these assets were encumbered by CMBS debt, which has -- which was paid off in September. These 9 assets represent roughly the first 1\/3 of the properties under evaluation for the capital recycling program, which comprises roughly 5% to 10% of the portfolio.","This initial portfolio has some winners and some losers but on balance, we expect to recognize a gain well in excess of any impairment charges or losses. We have been encouraged by the early indications of interest we have received, and we expect our capital recycling program will contribute to our objectives of narrowing our strategic focus, funding future capital requirements and driving improved return on invested capital.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our current leasing momentum.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Thank you, Scott. As you can see here on Page 5, we signed new leases totaling over $31 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Our recent leasing activity has been remarkably consistent. You may recall that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with a formal subtenant at a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. Excluding that one lease, we have signed between $30 million and $35 million every quarter this year. Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our leasing activity, again, this quarter. Our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $6 million in each of the past 3 quarters. This segment is representative of the steady pace we are seeing across our sales platform but has also been partially responsible for smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity just as we expected.","Turning now to Page 6. Cloud, content and social media had been the major drivers of our recent leasing activity and accounted for nearly 75% of our lease signings in the third quarter. We believe this demand represents a secular trend rather than a onetime thrill, and we believe we are still in the very early innings.","Cash rents on renewal leases rolled down by 6% as shown on Page 7. The primary driver was a large lease with a financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at peak rent, which we have highlighted on the last several calls. Needless to say, releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals remained quite healthy.","The face rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed shown here at the bottom of Page 8 were lower than last quarter albeit due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower-cost North American market, primarily Ashburn, Virginia. On a like-for-like basis, face rates were flat to up slightly, and returns are right in line with our expectations. In addition, net effective leasing economics continue to steadily improve. This improvement reflects the gradual recovery in data center fundamentals as well as the behavior changes driven by our new sales compensation program and tighter underwriting discipline as a function of our revamped investment review process.","These trends are indirectly reflected in tenant credit quality. Fully 60% of our third quarter leasing activity was with investment-grade credits. We also turned down several large potential deals with exceptionally strong credit tenants during the third quarter due to terms that did not meet our underwriting criteria, both economics as well as noneconomic. We believe our disciplined approach will lead to better returns for shareholders in the long run.","In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise stable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 9, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement ticked down to 5.5 months and has settled consistently in the 6-month range. We leased a total 14 megawatts during the third quarter, 6 of which were finished inventory. We placed several megawatts in service during the third quarter, and we did get back 2 megawatts in Phoenix from a tenant that was in holdover status as of June 30 that we discussed on the second quarter call.","The bottom line is that we generated 1 megawatt of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the third quarter. As you can see here on Page 10, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventories since our Investor Day last November. Incidentally, these numbers are as of September 30. We've absorbed 2 additional megawatts since the end of the third quarter.","Despite the space we got back in Phoenix during the third quarter, our historical data center tenant retention track record has been quite strong. As shown on Page 11, we have traditionally retained 84% of data center lease expiries. Leasing non-data center space has not been our forte and is part of the reason we are moving to rationalize our portfolio. That said, we have very recently been able to generate some positive leasing momentum at several of our non-data center properties. The incremental NOI should drive greater proceeds from non-core asset sales than anticipated just a short while ago.","Turning now to supply on Pages 12 and 13. It's interesting to see that available inventories shrank a bit in both the highly scrutinized Northern Virginia market as well as Silicon Valley, whereas we saw a modest uptick in Chicago and in Phoenix over the past 90 days.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to talk you through our financial results. Matt?","Matt Mercier","Thank you, Matt. As Scott mentioned, we closed a $187.6 million turnkey joint venture during the third quarter, and proceeds were used to pay down $130 million of CMBS debt at 5.65%. Debt to EBITDA improved 1\/10 of a turn to 5x, as you can see here on Page 14. We still have a U.S. dollar bond offering contemplated in our guidance for later this year. As shown here on Page 15 of the presentation, our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the course of the year, and we believe the current interest rate environment is attractive. We also believe it is prudent balance sheet management to finance long-lived assets with long-term capital, and we expect to tap the corporate bond market either later this year or early next year.","Turning now to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up 20 basis points, the second consecutive improvement in occupancy. We expect to finish the year at or slightly above the current level of 93%. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were negative in the third quarter, driven by the large roll-down in Northern Virginia. We are not out of the rental rate roll-down woods quite yet, but we have worked our way through the worst of the above-market lease expirations within our portfolio with a few notable exceptions, particularly in 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey.","As market rents continue to improve and as we address the remaining roll-downs, the mark-to-market should begin to approach 0 and turn consistently positive over the next couple of years. Same-capital cash NOI growth was 5.9% for the third quarter, above the high end of our guidance range, and we've raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points to between 4.5% to 5.5%. We've also whittled down the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast to a very manageable 0 to $5 million for the remainder of the year.","We've lowered our CapEx guidance for development spending by approximately 5% at the midpoint. We have the ability to self-fund our near-term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sales, and we currently have no plans to revisit the public equity market anytime soon. At the bottom line, we've raised the low end of the guidance range for 2014 core FFO per share by $0.05.","The upward revision to our bottom line forecast while tightening our budget for development spending speaks directly to our renewed underwriting discipline and emphasis on return on invested capital. Later this year, we will celebrate our 10th anniversary as a public company. As you can see from the charts here on Page 16 of the presentation, we've generated positive year-over-year growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year of our public company existence, including the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, and we expect 2015 will be no different. Bottom line growth will likely be modest next year, and organic growth will be the primary driver as external growth will be muted due to asset sales. We will also face a tough comp in the first quarter due to the $850 million long-term capital raised in March and April of this year. We will provide formal guidance in January, but we expect to generate core FFO per share growth next year in the low single digits.","And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Bill.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up by recapping the highlights from our third quarter results as outlined here on Page 17. We signed over $31 million of new leasing during the third quarter, including a $5 million mid-market contribution. We leased nearly 6 megawatts of finished inventory with 1 megawatt of positive net absorption. We registered a 20-basis-point sequential improvement in occupancy. We delivered 5.9% same-capital cash NOI growth and raised our organic growth forecast for the full year by 50 basis points. Our third quarter core FFO per share beat consensus by $0.02. And finally, we raised the low end of the range for 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. We believe these results demonstrate consistent execution on our strategic objectives. Our approach to capital recycling and disciplined leasing standards also demonstrate our renewed focus on generating long-term shareholder value in everything that we do.","In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and I would like to thank our outstanding global team of employees without whose contributions, these results would not be possible.","And now we are pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vance Edelson at Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to give you a chance to discuss outsourcing more. You mentioned that existing customers drove 90% of the growth, but you also added the 80 new logos. Is outsourcing still on the rise and that's what's supporting the 90% figure? And similarly, are the 80 new logos a sign that those companies are perhaps outsourcing for the first time?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. Thanks for the question, Vance. We do see outsourcing to be a continued trend that we discussed with our customers on an ongoing basis, and we really see it in both of the segments that you identified. Existing customers, especially our large enterprise existing customers, continue to be on the road for outsourcing their IT as well as their business processes, and we're there to support them. Maybe surprisingly, the new logos that we signed in both the large enterprise segment as well as the mid-market segment have a similar interest in outsourcing maybe for different reasons. The mid-market companies simply don't want to get started behind an operationally expensive set of processes, and our large enterprise customers have found a need to preserve some of their capital and to invest in strategic initiatives. But for both of these segments, outsourcing remains incredibly important for Digital Realty.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as a related follow-up, could you describe the momentum that the mid-market segment has? It seems like a relatively new initiative and yet the new leases signed seem to have leveled off to some extent. Is that something we can expect to see growing in the coming quarters?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. We see -- we're very pleased with the progress that we've seen in the mid-market since we announced its -- announced the initiative last year. We've seen that team really step up and consistently generate now between $4 million and $6 million in revenues over the past several quarters and a very large quarter in revenue production in Q4 of last year. So we couldn't be happier. Really, if you keep in mind that we basically grew a business that was producing between $1 million and $2 million of quarterly revenue, now we've increased that to $4 million to $6 million participation. So we're extremely excited about the progress that the mid-market team is making and the mid-market sales team combined with the operational team that supports that set of products.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. So kind of a related question to the previous one. The connectivity initiative, whether standard connection at your own sites or OPEN-IX, I wonder if you have an update on that. And then the colocation segments, as distinct from the mid-market initiative, it looks your colo rental rates increased, and I wonder what drove that. Was that deal size or geographic mix? And then another kind of observation, it looks like the Turn-Key rent dropped in Asia-Pac, and I wondered what drove that?","Matthew J. Miszewski","You managed to get a lot of questions in one question, but we'll try to address all of them. First of all, the connectivity initiative -- in terms of the connectivity initiative, we're extremely pleased with the progress that the operational team has made, and we moved the product ownership under the sales and marketing umbrella over this past quarter, 1.5 quarters as well. Connectivity has -- the network ecosystem project under connectivity, as you know, started in Europe and has moved its way throughout the United States. We've connected up major data centers in campuses within the United States, and we're in the process of doing the same thing in Asia Pacific. And so we're pleased to announce that we not only have completed most of that process but that we're starting to see the results as well. We measure the results of many of the partnerships that we do by the amount of GAAP rental revenue that they're able to influence. And the network ecosystem, in and of itself to date, has already influenced over $39 million of GAAP signings to date. Probably more important to that is that the network ecosystem really underlies our customers' desire to tap into the power of the hybrid cloud. This gets to the dual magnet metaphor that uses Bill uses from time to time when he talks about cloud service providers that exist within our data centers, in large numbers, the large portion of our revenue and how that attracts the large enterprises that are coming to our data centers and those large enterprises that we have also attracting additional cloud service providers. By combining that combination of great customers with the network ecosystem that we now have deployed, as well as the global cloud marketplace that we're looking to expand this fiscal year, it's important to realize that this is really the connectivity that was missing to enable the hybrid cloud for our customers. So we're extremely excited about that. I'm glad that you called out the colocation product and rental rates, in particular, for that individual product and that -- it's important to remember that, that product actually goes across multiple segments. So we do sell colocation into the mid-market segment as well as into the enterprise segment. And the increase in rental rates, I think, you've identified it already, really goes around the deal sizes that we landed within the quarter as well as the geographic diversity. Markets rates are different for colocation -- the colocation product in multiple markets, and we happen to be either lucky or smart enough to have landed them in the right markets this quarter. We'll see a slight bump in the rental rates. Was the third -- the third question, I believe, was on the TKF rental rates. Is that correct?","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Correct.","Matthew J. Miszewski","So in particular, in Asia Pac, I think your question sort of focused in on the TKF rental rate numbers in Asia Pacific, and we did have -- we had to call out that we did have one large deal that we secured in Hong Kong, which we view as a onetime event, was a very strategic partner. We went into that deal for very specific reasons between the 2 partners, in particular, to open up some market opportunities that were closed off to us before. We believe we successfully completed that set of transactions and that this one lease is really a onetime event. It really highlights that we're able to make strategic decisions in concert with our greatest partners and our greatest customers throughout the world.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little about your weighted average lease term? I noticed in the quarter, it was down to 6.3 years from 6.8 last quarter. Just maybe talk a little bit about why that number shifted so notably from Q2 to Q3.","Matthew J. Miszewski","So Ross, thanks for the question. The shorter lease terms, we need to understand in a context of the duration of those leases that are being signed as well as understanding that obviously it's an average. So we're still seeing some good lease terms come in. And -- but I understand that we're comfortable signing shorter-term leases in the marketplace where we really believe that the fundamentals inside that marketplace are improving, especially at the time of potential expiration. Also important for everyone to remember that our retention rates remain high. So we are comfortable with this shorter initial term. It's also become a little bit of a trend in the marketplace for folks who initially say they want a smaller term to actually go ahead and take their additional option earlier in that process. So maybe a tip box in terms of procurement, but we're seeing those people renew early in some cases or do must-takes early in some cases as well. In essence, what all this signals is that the fundamentals in this market are improving.","Arthur William Stein","Ross, let me add to that, that we also see the same company that are doing shorter-term leases, putting significant investment into the premises even though they might be doing a 5-year lease.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As a follow-up, not really much related, but what is -- what should we all expect, Bill, on the timing for the, I guess, full CEO announcement. Is that happening before NAREIT, before year-end? What can you tell us at this point?","Arthur William Stein","So Ross, we have bet here internally as to which question it would be, but...","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm surprised to think we...","Matthew J. Miszewski","I am also.","Arthur William Stein","So we have heard that question before. The answer to the question is that we fully expect that it will be before year-end. That's what we've said, really, since the transition was announced last March. And as we also indicated, the board back then and still is comfortable with the current leadership that's in place, but the focus remains finding the right candidate and that is unquestionably the priority. Fortunately, in the interim, the stock has performed well. We're up over 40% since March. We've outperformed the RMZ by 2,000 basis points, and we remain focused on executing our strategic vision. And thank you for the question.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut at Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. I guess, my first question is really about sort of your view on the global market. You guys have a great success in Asia Pac, and at a recent conference, your fastest-growing customer talked about going to dozens of new countries in the next few years. So I was just wondering what your perspective was in terms of expanding your footprint globally beyond the markets that you're currently operating in.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So Jonathan, we do. And I think as Bill said in his initial statements, we will certainly look at new opportunities with our great customers in tow. But important to also understand that our -- one of our focuses -- one of our strategic focuses within sales and marketing is targeting at the beginning as well as targeting expansion with companies that have a stated desire or already active in global expansion that matches our existing portfolio, where we happen to have existing inventory or shell available. So that alignment by us to sort of generating demand across companies that have a desire to grow globally matches our current footprint in terms of what we have existing inventory in pretty darn well. We also happen to find out that those customers stay with us longer. They're happy to give us longer lease terms, and they're much more easy to satisfy in terms of customers because their value expectation is aligned very well with the value that we provide. I think Bill mentioned in his opening statements 2 geographies that were of interest. Maybe I'll turn it over to Bill to see if he wants to talk a little bit more about future potential expansion.","Arthur William Stein","And Jonathan, so I've mentioned Germany and Japan. But in addition, I mean, we -- if we have a -- I'm sure we both know the customer you're talking about. But if we have a strong customer that wants us to go to a certain market, and in this particular case, this customer is, they lease multiple megs from us at one time. So if we can get comfortable with the demand in that market, and we can get comfortable with other risks, so currency risk, political risk, we can structure ample lease term to mitigate risk. And we have a customer that's taking a significant percentage of a building, then we are -- will be more willing to look into a new market.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. Just as my follow-up question, are there any markets that you're concerned with? There's a recent report out that the big 4 markets in Asia Pac are going to see something like a 40% inventory increase over the next 12 to 24 months. Are there any markets that you're concerned about in terms of inventory?","Arthur William Stein","We haven't seen that in Asia at this point. We're seeing really good absorption in our 2 Australian markets. And in Singapore, we're basically full. And Hong Kong is filling rapidly, too. So we haven't seen the evidence of that. We -- there had been commentary about excess supply in North American markets in Silicon Valley and Virginia, in particular. But once again there, we've seen significant absorption of our inventory. In fact, we can't even keep up in Northern Virginia. I think basically, the difference to maybe the type of product that we're delivering to the market, and we do provide the 2-end solution, a dedicated infrastructure. And I suspect that if there's commentary about excess supply, it's probably the share in infrastructure product.","Matthew J. Miszewski","That's an important distinction, Jonathan, that Bill is making. As I look at our 12-month future pipeline, I see a good dominant part of that being the customers that regularly buy the dedicated solution from us here at Digital. That doesn't foreclose us from making sure we truly understand the customers' needs in the 4 big markets in Asia Pacific. But as opposed to our competition who is testing the waters, we've got a proven product that we're able to deploy and have successfully deployed over the past 5 years. We certainly will look at continuing to do that and then exploit any future opportunities that we see.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, Jonathan. Just to point out, in Hong Kong and Singapore, in particular, land is tight. So it really is hard to get sites there. I know there's one of our competitors is bringing on a site January 1, but I think that's really the only one that we'd be concerned about in Singapore.","Operator","The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to echo Jonathan's comments on great execution during the quarter. First question, Bill, you did discuss in your commentary about turning down quite a few deals with larger tenants because you weren't happy with the economics or the terms or what have you. Could you just kind of give us a sense of what some of those type of deals were that you turned down? And if whether you would have actually accepted those kind of deals a year to 2 years ago.","Arthur William Stein","Well, I don't know that those deals would have existed a couple of years ago. But the -- I think that my biggest objection to these deals was the customer's attempt to transfer what I thought were the customer's business risks to us for a standard of conduct within the data center's four walls that was quite low, a simple negligence as opposed to gross negligence or willful misconduct. So what I'm referring to is indemnity clauses for basically mistakes or omissions inside a data center by the operator, what the right standard of conduct is. And we've held to a standard of willful misconduct, and we do not indemnify for consequential damages. And in this case, we have customers that are looking for a lower standard and a broader scope of indemnity.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So if it wasn't the case of the pricing on the deals or anything like that, it was more along some of the operational risks you would have to take if you actually accepted these deals.","Arthur William Stein","Yes. Not so much, that's why I made the comment in my remarks about being focused on long-term value creation. And these were deals that would have been very beneficial to short-term FFO growth. But at the end of the day, we're focused on residual value as well and what types of risk we might be creating for the long term.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just my second question, excluding the financial clients this quarter, could you give us a sense of what GAAP, as well as cash mark-to-market, would have looked like, excluding that large roll-down?","Matt Mercier","Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. I don't think we have that breakout at our fingertips, but we can follow up at a later date.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the non-core dispositions with the 9 assets currently in market, guidance goes up to $400 million for the year in terms of the range. Just trying to get a sense of over the balance of this year as well as '15. I guess, the 9 represents about 1\/3 of the non-core that you've identified. I mean, how much of that non-core do you think could go between now and the end of next year?","Matthew J. Miszewski","In the first group that we have, that will all likely transact between now and the end of this year in January, and that total volume's about $260 million in proceeds on that. And we expect to add -- I'll give you a little more information there. We think that will go at an average cap rate, overall, of about a little over a 6 cap rate on that. We then have 3 other -- then we have 2 other groupings of properties that we're looking at. The next grouping is a group of 6 assets that are more, rather than being non-core, these are more non-core data center assets. And we're going through the valuation process of those right now. So it's a little early to give you any indication. But we'd expect that the ones of those we do bring to market would be brought to market first quarter.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the internal growth side, you obviously raised the same-capital outlook by 50 basis points. In past presentations, you've talked about sort of an ongoing business model that talks about sort of 4% to 5% growth. I guess, is there any reason to think that 2015 should stray significantly from what we saw here in 2014 and sort of relative to that longer-term outlook?","Arthur William Stein","Yes. I mean, as we -- Vincent, as we said, we'll give specifics on 2015 guidance later this year, and we'll -- at that time, we'll break down all those components as we have -- as we've done the last several quarters, but we're not at a point where we can provide that detail at this time. But we'll definitely have it when we give formal guidance later this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I think you touched on a little bit sort of post-quarter end leasing but curious more in terms of the seasonality that the portfolios historically experienced in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. Are you still expecting, maybe for Matt or for Bill, the same sort of historical seasonality? Or would that -- should that pick up in the fourth quarter? Or has that been somewhat muted as well by the mid-market strategy?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So the seasonality is interesting, given the launch last year of the mid-market strategy. In general, we're pleased with our sales and marketing team, Jordan being able to generate consistent results that are in line with our plan. We consider quarters like this to be successful quarters when they meet the plan. And you touched on one of the drivers, which, of course, is the mid-market initiative, which, if you remember, seems like way back. It wasn't that long ago when we announced the initiative. Part of the purpose of it was to smooth out the revenue lumpiness that came from the large enterprise segment. And I think we've been fairly successful at doing that. Unfortunately, one of the side effects of wiping out the lumpiness of the large enterprise segment is the perceived seasonality of the past may look a little less certain, and so we need to get a little -- a few more quarters under our belts before we can identify what the true seasonality is, given the new set of products and new set of markets that we're addressing. We do think that our -- the seasonality will reflect customer demand, which have relatively unique drivers. So inside an individual vertical, for instance, financial services, I'm having 2 sets of conversations, one with a company that has a large deployment that needs to go live in the first half of next year, and we're having that conversation. We'll strike a deal this quarter. And the other one, who wants to start the conversation in Q2 but will deliver the actual project in Q4. So unfortunately, seasonality is also at the call of our customers' internal calendars.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, maybe for Scott, on pricing and cap [ph] achieved. Obviously, the joint venture helped us sort of shed some light on pricing this quarter. I'm curious, do you think pricing achieved on this transaction is somewhat representative overall of the portfolio of assets, sort of excluding the platform value, especially, obviously, as it relates to Turn-Key?","Scott E. Peterson","Yes. Yes, just remember data centers are kind of complicated, but we happen to like this comp very much. This is a good cap rate, 7.05%. But also when you keep that in light of the price per foot and the price per kilowatt that this traded at, I think this is a very good comp. And it shows that the private demand and pricing continues to grow for these assets, and we're also very happy with these access to another source of capital for our program.","Operator","The next question come from Matthew Heinz at Stifel.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I'm interested to hear more about the Global Alliances Program, realizing it's still very early in the process. But I guess, just hoping to understand how receptive existing customers have been to these offerings, particularly within the enterprise segment and then maybe the balance of engagement between mid-market versus wholesale customers. And then as a follow-on to that, I'm hoping you could just collaborate on sort of how you view the cloud marketplace initiative, I suppose, in terms of whether you see it as a value enhancement to the existing service and connectivity offerings. Or is it more of an up-sell opportunity with sort of longer-term implications around ARPU?","Matthew J. Miszewski","So in terms of the Global Alliances Program, the program, when combined directly with the network initiative, has influenced an awful lot of the deals that are out there. But what's interesting is -- what we're trying to enable is something that we're not unfamiliar with. When we -- Scott started in this industry 10 to 12 years ago, we became a carrier-controlled data center provider because of our customers' perceived challenges with network operator-owned data centers. And so that shift in market dynamics allowed us to bring carrier-neutral data centers to the fray and allowed us to capture that market opportunity. We're seeing something similar here, and it sort of will answer both of your questions. The Global Alliances that we're striking are meant to give optionality to our customers that they're asking for. The wider array of that optionality is what we need to provide as data center providers. So that no matter what direction our customers want to go to enable their hybrid cloud ambition, they can do it within Digital Realty property. And so again, as I stated earlier on the hybrid cloud question, what we do here allows our customers to truly connect their services to data centers that they might have inside other Digital Realty data centers, but also they can connect to cloud providers outside of that venue, and they can connect to cloud providers that are not within Digital's own network services. So our network service partners can now securely connect those enterprise clients to all of their assets as well as to internal private clouds, and so what we're seeing is something very similar to the process that we came into a few years ago. So now instead of it being carrier neutrality, it really is cloud service provider neutrality, and part of our partnership efforts or Global Alliances efforts is to make sure that we're able to bring the right cloud service providers to the foray. That worked this quarter in VMWare as well as in Carpathia. Our providers that our customer said they wanted to connect to more directly within Digital's data centers, we're being able to provide that sort of connectivity to them, and we see that as the end in and of itself. If you think about the global cloud marketplace as well as the rest of the partnership ecosystem as an amenity that is now necessary in a modern data center as we move our customers from wanting simply to store data in a data center to want to actively exchange data within a data center and within multiple data centers, that's really the key that we're trying to provide to those customers.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And then just very quickly, is there -- do you see any potential for a special distribution of the gains from the joint venture?","Arthur William Stein","So our board meets next week, and the board sets the dividend. So it's something that we're looking at. Basically, the trade-off is going to be a pullback of the first quarter dividend or special dividend, and we haven't decided on that. And even if we had decided on it, we wouldn't jump ahead of the board.","Operator","The next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman at Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I look at your lease rollover schedule, it looks like you still have a fair amount of PBB leasing to do this year, and those rates are well above average. Was wondering if you can give us some insight as to what that is and how that's going to get addressed.","Matt Mercier","Manny, it's Matt. Actually, that -- the vast majority that's already been released is actually renewal -- or a re-lease we signed back in the first quarter, and it's going to roll, I think, slightly either flat or slightly up on a cash basis. So that is -- that's already taken care of.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And great, and then maybe you can help me get one other piece of disclosure. On the market-by-market disclosure, it looks like the megawatts went up in Northern Virginia, but the rentable square footage to occupancy and the lease square footage all came down. I realize that, that might be tied to the most recent JV. But I was just wondering how those could go in different directions.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. I mean, we'll have to -- I don't know. Obviously, as you know, Northern Virginia is probably one of our most active markets in terms of development. So I'm sure it has to do with the development activity that we're bringing online as well as the joint venture that came out. I don't have the specifics, but I'm sure it has something to do with those 2 interplays.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Douglas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's obviously been a while since we've seen Digital acquire in the space, and I'm wondering if you could maybe comment on how you're thinking about consolidation now, given the strength in your stock this year and maybe some of the criteria you look for in a target. And then second, you touched a little bit on the macro outlook, and I'm wondering if you could comment specifically on the leasing environment you're seeing in Europe and also maybe FX impact you saw in 3Q and expect for 4Q.","Scott E. Peterson","Yes. Stephen, it's Scott. To answer that, we're always in the market looking at M&A opportunities, and we keep abreast of everything, whether it's kind of near term or long term out there. There hasn't been anything very compelling lately. I think our primary focus is always how are we adding value to our shareholders when we look at these. I think there are many opportunities that we look at, which would give us the chance to get only larger and not better or more profitable for our shareholders. So I think our first and foremost goal on all those is to do something that's going to be compelling for our shareholders. And off late, we haven't really seen anything that fits that bill. But we are always -- we're always looking at opportunities, and we'll always pursue those to the extent we think we can do something positive.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. And so on the lease, we'll do this in 3 parts, Stephen. On the leasing side in Europe, without divulging the large enterprise software maker's name, we did see some great activity with what we call a potential franchise account happening within continental Europe this quarter. And probably more important, as I look forward in the next 2 quarters as well as the 12 months looking forward, we see a very healthy pipeline for the properties that we currently have in Europe as well as some of the properties that we have looked to develop in the past.","Matt Mercier","Yes. And this is the other Matt. We -- on the FX issue, we're about 80% hedged in terms of our FX exposure, so it takes a pretty material movement to have a meaningful impact on our bottom line. If rates had remained unchanged versus last quarter, our FFO in Q3 would have been about $0.005 higher. And I think that speaks to the advantage of being an investment grade rated since it allows -- we can fund in multiple currencies, and as you know, we raised a pretty large sterling deal earlier this year, a long-term bond. And overall, I think we've raised over $1 billion in sterling since in the public market. So this goes to show what having a strong balance sheet can do for you in terms of hedging your risks.","Arthur William Stein","And Stephen, let me just sort of pile on here. The -- if we were to find an acquisition that were attractive, public equity is now no longer our only source of equity, as we now have a -- of what I think is fairly reliable source of private capital as well for deals of that type.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session and concludes the conference.

William Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we outlined our strategic vision for the company and the initiatives that we\u2019re pursuing to advance that vision. Today, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress that we\u2019ve made over the last 120 days, beginning here on Page 2 of our presentation.","We\u2019ve stated that driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory is our top priority. I am pleased to announce that we leased 9 megawatts of existing inventory during the second quarter. We\u2019ve reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25% since Investor Day last November. This enhanced asset utilization has boosted our ROIC by over 20 basis points so far this year.","We\u2019re also well underway on a rigorous evaluation of the entire portfolio. This process is designed to identify non-strategic and underperforming assets that can be harvested to narrow our focus on the core. We expect our capital recycling initiative will likewise have a meaningfully positive impact on overall return on invested capital. We expect to conclude this exercise over the summer and bring the first set of properties to market immediately after Labor Day.","Scott Peterson will have more to say about our efforts on this front during his remarks. ","In early June, we announced our global cloud marketplace, a solution that makes our customers public, private and hybrid cloud services, easily accessible to our entire global customer base. We believe that partnering with our customers is the best way to provide our enterprise customers with a differentiated offering and to create value. The global cloud marketplace will enable Digital Realty clients to instantly provision on demand, burstable cloud services from trusted cloud providers such as IBM SoftLayer, Internap, Interoute, GoGrid, and SingleHop. And program is still on its infancy, but demand for the offering has been strong and we expect to see healthy adoption as awareness grows.","I\u2019d like to pause here for a moment and explain why the concept behind the cloud marketplace is so important for our future direction. A year and a half ago, at the Citi Conference in Florida, Michael Bilerman stepped out of character for a moment and served me up a softball. He asked what aspect of our story was most underappreciated by investors? I responded that it was our global footprint and our enterprise customer base. That was true then, but it\u2019s even more applicable today. Modern cloud providers cater to small and medium-size businesses, but they all aspire to penetrate the enterprise marketplace.","The enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base. They already populate our data centers around the world. Our recent leasing activity has been heavily skewed to cloud service providers, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. Enterprise customers in turn are attracted by the ability to easily and securely connect to multiple areas of their hybrid cloud. Both sets of customers choose to grow on our platform, in part because of the presence of other.","The final catalyst connecting our incredible enterprise customer base to the cloud service providers they now need to grow is the deployment of our global network ecosystem. This mutual attraction and our interconnected global portfolio essentially act as a wide mode that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. No one else has the footprint and the cost structure to effectively service the enterprise customer on a global basis.","The competitive advantage of this network effect is analogous to a network-dense data center but on a global portfolio scale rather than a single building. This premise will be borne out over time by the ability to attract new enterprise logos, as well as new cloud service providers, the ability to retain these customers and the growth of their existing footprints within our portfolio.","Back to current results. Our mid-market segment turned in another solid performance this quarter. The investments we\u2019ve made in upgrading connectivity and expanding the amenities that we offer are enhancing RPO to retail customers.","As you can see from our press release, we\u2019ve raised guidance for our capital spending plans over the balance of the year. Over 90% of this additional capital commitment is due to incremental leasing activity. This match between leasing and funding is exactly what we aim to achieve with the build-to-order inventory management strategy that we outlined last quarter.","Unleashing intellectual capital is something of a soft initiative. So let me give you some tangible examples. For starters, our General Counsel, Josh Mills\u2019 responsibilities had been expanded to include environmental fairs and corporate real estate.","Sustainability has been important issue for data centers, given the sector\u2019s energy footprint and Josh will be sphere hitting our efforts on this front. John Sarcus who many of you met at various conferences and investor events has recently been named Colocation general manager, in addition to his responsibilities leading our connectivity initiative.","Scott Peterson\u2019s promotion to Chief Investment Officer has arguably had the most immediate impact. He and his team are restructuring the investment review process to ensure consistency across disciplines and regions. Essentially, any deal that requires commitment of incremental capital is now brought before the investment committee. This process is imposing tighter discipline on capital allocation decisions and promoting appropriate behavior from the sales team, as well as the broker channels.","It also delayed two quarter end leasing transactions, which has traditionally been the window when customers were able to extract the most favorable terms. One of these deals has come back to us and appears likely to close on terms that we proposed. This underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods, particularly, as we continue to riddle down our stockpile of available inventory. However, we are confident that this approach is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders.","Looking forward and turning now to page 3 of the presentation, we see robust demand for the premium data center solutions we offer, providing peace of mind to our customers and enabling them to focus on their core business. The macro backdrop appears relatively benign despite the reason rise in geopolitical uncertainty.","Data center fundamentals are gradually improving, as excess supply is being consistently absorbed. We are taking a much more disciplined approach to inventory management. And we see more rationale behavior for many other industry participants as well.","Consequently, we are cautiously optimistic that data center fundamentals will continue to improve underpinning acceptable risk-adjusted returns, as well as the stability of our cash flows.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Scott to provide an update on our capital recycling initiatives.","Scott E. Peterson","","Thank you, Bill. As mentioned in the last quarter, the investment team is undertaking a wholesale analysis of every single property in our portfolio. This analysis is well underway and should be complete later this year. The first phase of the project targeted a group of high priority properties consisting primarily of non-core assets, data center properties in non-core markets, underperformers and at-risk properties.","As a result of this analysis, we expect to prune the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio in order to refine our strategic focus, fund future capital requirements and improve return on invested capital. As Bill mentioned, we plan to start bringing these properties to market after Labor Day.","During the second quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of a small single tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million, generating a gain on sale of approximately $16 million and realizing a levered IRR in the low teens.","While the cap rate was at the high end of our expected disposition range, it is not a very relevant metric in this instance as there are only 18 months left on the lease term. We did explore several options for the property and determined we could generate a better return on our capital elsewhere.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to discuss our recent leasing activity.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Thank you, Scott. As shown page 5 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling over $35 million of annualized GAAP rent during the second quarter. The first half of the year tends to be seasonally slow. The consistency of our recent leasing momentum is readily apparent from a comparison of our year-to-date leasing activity, relative to the first half of any previous year. Keep in mind that the $47 million we reported in the first quarter included a $12 million direct lease with the former subtenant at a Powered-Base Building in Santa Clara.","Excluding this lease, our second quarter leasing velocity was right on top of the first quarter and both quarters progressed according to plan. This positive momentum has carried through to the month of July and the third quarter is off to a strong start as well.","Colocation revenue accounted for over 15% of our second quarter leasing activity. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a contribution within a range for $4 million to $8 million. The purchase in context, is helpful to realize that prior to the third quarter of 2013, this segment typically generated between $1 million and $2 million per quarter.","Cloud, content and social media were the drivers once again accounting for over three-forth of our second quarter leasing activity. Existing customers represented more than 80% of our second quarter lease signings, but the new team has also added 60 new logos year-to-date. Cash rents on renewal leases rolled out by mid-single digits as shown on page six. The large lease with the financial services tenant in Northern Virginia that was signed at Pageant and that we highlighted on the last call was finally renewed in July.","The rent roll down 11% on a cash basis, a bit better than the 15% to 20% roll down we guided towards previously. This renewal was not reflected in our second quarter leasing statistics, but will obviously leave a mark in the third quarter although it has been fully baked into our guidance. It\u2019s important to note that this transaction was also expanded to include one part in Dallas, as well as the fourth part in Ashburn. Base rates on Turn-Key Flex leases signed were lower than last quarter entirely due to market mix, reflecting a concentration of activity in lower cost, lower rent in North American markets including Dallas, Ashburn and Phoenix.","On a like-for-like basis, base rents were flat to up slightly. More importantly, concessions are abating. This improvement reflects our retool sales compensation program, and the revamped investment review process, as well as gradually improving data center fundamentals. Turn-Key leasing costs were elevated in the second quarter driven primarily by one large 15-year lease. Adjusting for term on a per square foot per year of lease turn basis, the second quarter leasing cost terms are significantly diverged from the norm.","Turning now to lease duration on page eight, lease terms are admittedly shorter on core location leasing and as Bill mentioned, last quarter we are comparable going a bit shorter in a rising rental rate environment. The average turn on leases signed during the second quarter was over seven years. This is true whether the second quarter leasing activity is weighted by square feet or by rent. The weighted average remaining lease term across the entire portfolio is half year shorter, we did by rent rather than square feet, but it\u2019s still well over six years.","The duration of our average lease term supports the stability of our cash flow stream and strengthens our cost of capital advantage. In addition to signings lease commencements were also respectable. As you can see from the chart at the bottom right of page nine, the weighted average lag between signing and commencement and stuff from six to seven months. This lag is entirely due to future delivery of committed space and is not indicative of either free rents or an elongation of the sales cycle. The team reached a total of 17 megawatts during the second quarter of which 9 or a little more than half came from our finished inventory balance. To put this in contact, the historical average mix of existing inventory as a present of total leasing has been one-third of the total. We started new clouds in Ashburn and in Hong Kong this quarter and the net absorption of finished inventory was 4.5 megawatts.","As Bill mentioned during his remarks, and as you can see here on page 10, we have reduced our finished inventory balance by over 25%, since the Investor Day last November. The positive net absorption in Phoenix over that timeframe is particularly encouraging. It was also encouraging to see this positive net absorption translate to a 70 basis point improvement in overall portfolio occupancy. Following several quarters of declines, due to the move out of various non-data center tenants along with the delivery of the inventory that we are now absorbing.","We did have one tenant occupying 2 megawatts in Phoenix, that was in whole over started as of June 30 and is expected to move out in the third quarter. We have a very healthy demand funnel in Phoenix however, and we expect overall portfolio occupancy to continue to improve in the second half.","Turning now to supply on pages 11 and 12, the available inventory in Northern Virginia has actually come down by a few megawatts over the past 90 days. While new construction is underway in Texas. I\u2019d like to point out, that these charts reflect total market supply and do not differentiate between shared back plain facilities and our dedicated infrastructure product. We believe that much of this available supply is not directly competitive with our offering.","As a case in point, we have a very healthy demand funnel in both Northern Virginia and Dallas, and we can scarcely keep any inventory on the shelf in either market. The uptick in sublease space in Santa Clara resides within our portfolio. We received notice from an internet enterprise that represents approximately 1% of NOI that they intend submit approximately 10 megawatts they occupy in Santa Clara. Their leases expired in 2016 and 2019 and the in place rent is well below market. We are working with the client on it solution, and do have interest in the space from multiple perspective customers.","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to talk you through our financial results. Matt?","Matthew Mercier","Thank you, Matt. Most of the balance sheet activity occurred prior through our last earnings call, but several significant events took place during the second quarter. In mid-April, our exchangeable debentures are exchanged for common equity, which improved debt to EBITDA by 0.3 turns. We also raised an additional $63.5 million in April under reopening of the 7 and 3H Series H preferred and partial exercise of the underwriters over allotment option, including the sterling bond offering and the original Series H issuance that closed in the first quarter.","This brings our year-to-date total of long-term capital ratio approximately $900 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable reflecting our improved operating performance As shown here on page 14 of the presentation, the bond market has taken note and our credit spreads have tightened considerably over the past several months, and have also our performed the re-BBB benchmark, most notably since S&P revised its outlook.","Turning now to operating performance, as Matt alluded to in his remarks, portfolio occupancy ticked up 70 basis points. The first sequential occupancy gain in the past six quarters. We\u2019ve also raised guidance for the year-end portfolio occupancy by 75 basis points at the mid-point on the strength of the second quarter rebound. As Matt indicated in his presentation, cash releasing spreads were positive across product types in the second quarter.","Although, the large roll down in Northern Virginia was signed in July, it will have an impact on our third quarter leasing statistics. Same capital cash NOI growth was 5.8% for the second quarter, above the high end of our forecast. The year-to-date number is squarely within the 4% to 5% guidance range. I\u2019d also like to address our guidance for incremental revenues remaining to be recognized in 2014 from speculative leasing, which shows the reduction from $10 million to $15 million last quarter to $5 million to $10 million this quarter.","As of mid-July, we have already achieved the full speculative leasing target that was embedded in our prior guidance. We are not resting on laurels for the rest of the year, however, we\u2019ve raised the bar by an additional $5 million to $10 million of current year revenue we expect to recognize from leases that have not yet been signed. We\u2019ve also raised CapEx guidance for development spending and capitalize leasing cost by approximately 15% at the mid-point.","However, as Bill mentioned in his remarks, over 90% of this additional capital commitment is related to incremental leasing activity. We expect to fund near term capital requirements with proceeds from asset sale and joint ventures. We currently have no plans to revisit the equity market any time soon. At the bottom line, we\u2019ve raised core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Our improved outlook is entirely organic. We\u2019ve actually reduced our acquisitions guidance by half. We\u2019ve also introduced disposition guidance for the first time and we do expect a couple of pennies per share of dilution on a combination of assets sales and joint venture contributions in the second half of the year.","To recap the highlights for the quarter, as advertised here on page 16, we signed over $35 million of new leasing during the second quarter, including a $5.7 million mid-market contribution. Released 9 megawatts of existing inventory with 4.5 megawatts of positive net absorption. We achieved our full-year speculative leasing target. We\u2019ve registered an uptick in occupancy for the first time in a year and half. We generated positive cash releasing spreads across the product types.","We delivered 5.8% same capital cash NOI growth. S&P revised its outlook from negative to stable. Our second quarter core FFO per share consensus by a $1. And finally, we raised 2014 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 at the mid-point. We are quite pleased with our second quarter financial results. And as most people here at Digital know I am fairly hard to please.","And now, we\u2019ll be pleased to open up the call and take your question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance H. Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank a lot. So as you look to bring the first set of properties to market after Labor Day, maybe if you could just provide an update on the money flows in the data center world. Who the potential buyers might be? I think in the recent past, you've mentioned seeing pension and other money looking to invest. Any updates there on demand or even cap rates? Will it be more users looking to buy? And any appearance of sovereign wealth money yet?","Scott E. Peterson","Yes. Vance it\u2019s Scott Peterson here. It\u2019s a little soon to say, but as far as the buyers we\u2019re seeing a lot of \u2013 we\u2019re seeing demand on the buy side to be pretty robust in the private markets. I think we\u2019ll find on the non-core assets, I think we\u2019ll find traditional buyers for those types for assets that will be interested in them, the data center buyers will be a mix and the non-core markets will be a mix of maybe value add as well as traditional stabilized asset buyers, and then for some of the underperformers I think we\u2019ll see probably more the value add type buyers there, there might be private equity backed, but that\u2019s kind of really speculation at this point, what I can say is we\u2019re getting numerous phone calls from potential buyers out there that are very interested in looking at anything that we\u2019re interested in selling.","Vance H. Edelson \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned geopolitical risk. Could you expand on that a bit? Where you think there might be potential risk? And perhaps while you\u2019re at it, just walk us through Europe \u2013 do Germany, France, and the UK remain strong? Any updates on demand in Asia? Do the inventory shortages continue there? Just kind of walk us around the globe in terms of strength and weaknesses?","A. William Stein","","So London is very strong for us Vance, in fact we\u2019re in the process of running out of inventory there. We\u2019re bringing a project online in Dublin and we would expect the demand there to come mostly from this side of the pond. We have very little inventory in Paris I think less than half a plot and we\u2019re considering Amsterdam, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we have a site in Amsterdam, a land site but we won\u2019t be building there unless we have a pre-lease situation. Asia-Pac is also a very strong; Singapore, we could be out of inventory in Singapore by the end of next quarter. And I think in Hong Kong it\u2019s a good possibility we\u2019ll be out at the end of this year. So we\u2019re looking for additional sites both in Singapore and Hong Kong and leasing in Australia has been steady both in Melbourne and Sydney.","Matt Miszewski","Vance, this is Matt Miszewski and given my political background apparently I get to answer the geopolitical risk questions. I don\u2019t see any impact to us on the geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East, or in Central, and Eastern Europe. It is important though to understand that privacy concerns of the European Union and the non-Union countries that are inside Europe does have a bit of an impact on operations of datacenters through continental Europe as well as the islands. That actually ends up being a demand driver for some of our key customers including some very large cloud providers who are taking a deployment strategy to eliminate the data sovereignty risk that other providers have. So we\u2019re happy to see folks adjust for data sovereignty requirements within EMEA. As Bill said, we see the Asia demand on the demand side extremely strong and we don\u2019t see any geopolitical risk throughout our Asia-Pac portfolio.","Operator","","And our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is Rob for Jonathan. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the increasingly solutions based sales approach under match guidance and how the strategies evolving in terms of the sales team and the recession by customers. And secondly regarding the launch of the global market place can you talk a little bit about take rates or how those services have been adopted with new customers or with new leasing and the impact on pricing.","Matt Miszewski","","Happy to Rob, your first question is about the solution based sales approach and we continue to see this evolve in the best of possible situations where we are getting closer to our customers and really starting to approach the customer base from their point of view as opposed to from our point of view. We did need to make some fundamental adjustments to the sales force including the compensation plan adjustments that we made this past year before we went after the more advanced selling process in terms of solution selling, but now we see solution architecture as part of what we do inside the sales force as well as inside the small marketing team that I have on my team. If you think about the basics of this instead of us simply providing fantastic technical solutions for customers that we create here in San Francisco or in London or in Singapore, now we do this in partnership with our customers by sitting down with them talking to them about what their needs are and then making sure that our products and our solutions sit and meet their needs. One of the things we found out when we started this solution based process was that we did need things like the global cloud marketplace. And so the conversation that we are having with our customers are leading us to do things that make them more sticky inside all of our properties.","The global cloud marketplace is one of this; the global network ecosystem is another one. And this has been successful we started as you know we started in Europe; we finished the North America rollout and the Asia Pacific rollout is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. When we finish that rollout, our network ecosystem will feature connectivity to over 1,000 available networks across the world.","The last piece I will talk about in terms of this solution approach is our Open-IX initiative, not our Open-IX initiative, but the communities Open-IX initiative, is really starting to take off. We\u2019ve of course landed at the Amsterdam internet exchange inside our New York \u2013 one of our New York facilities as well as landed them into one of our Western Coast facilities and we are talking to four more providers right now.","As you can see as we\u2019ve taken this approach and we\u2019ve led this approach in terms of solution based selling, you can start to see the data center industry itself start to transform from storage to a more affordable way for our customers to exchange data, which is truly the value that they see inside data centers today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Anything about take rates? Or any sort of \u2013 can you quantify any of that related to new leasing activity or anything?","Matt Miszewski","Yes. So when we announced the global cloud marketplace in June, we announced it early and we\u2019re in the early innings of the consideration of the GCM, what we\u2019ve also noticed is that there is an awful lot, we\u2019re learning more than we thought we would learn initially. And that learning is that there is an awful lot of demand for global cloud marketplace that we didn\u2019t anticipate. So we\u2019re starting to see not just cloud marketplace that we\u2019ve launched, but individual cloud marketplaces that are starting to come up in the conversation that we have with both our partners, as well as our customers.","So I think the take rate question is a little bit too soon right now. We\u2019ve just operationally launched the facility and we\u2019re filling it up with partners today. and once we start to see, I mean we start to actively market that solution, I think you\u2019re going to start to see the uptake increase. And so we should be able to give some updates on that on next call.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on just the economics around some of the deals that were signed this quarter, specifically Page 17 of the supplemental. If you just kind of take a look at leasing costs of square foot, it\u2019s gone up quite a bit that many leverage lease term is filled roughly about the same for a lot of your new leasing activities. So I\u2019m just a little bit curious about why the higher leasing costs and what may be going on and we got to higher negotiating with tenants that\u2019s resulting in this?","A. William Stein","Tayo, that was one long-term deal in the quarter that drove an external commission that was quite substantially. So the leasing costs were based on that land commission, not TIs. And we don\u2019t see this as a trend. I think importantly, we\u2019re still seeing ROICs including TIs and LCs hitting our target range of 10% to 12%. And the comp plan that we put in place at the beginning of the year as we think is proving these leasing economics.","Matt Miszewski","Yes. Tayo, this is Matt when we start to look at the total leasing costs across the quarter of course, we dug in a little bit deeper as the guys who launched the new comp plan, I wanted to make sure we\u2019re having the demonstrative effects that we anticipated we would. And as I said in my opening statements, we\u2019ve seen the rent abatements go away and lease ramps shorten, we\u2019ve also seen TIs in our world start to decrease when we do quarter-to-quarter comparisons, it is a significant decrease especially across the GKF products.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC","I think we took up that large tenant what would be you know what the number would have been for the quarter in regards to leasing cost per square foot on that when tenant?","A. William Stein","","I don\u2019t know that I have that data immediately in front of me, but I\u2019d be happy to provide that right after the call.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you guys talk a little bit about the lease expirations for the remainder of the year I see you got 5.4% of your rent roll expiring at about 190 bucks per foot can you just give us a little bit of color on what you think the retention rate is going to be on that? I know you talk about that one I think was that one leasing in Phoenix but beyond that what you expect the retention to be?","Matt Miszewski","","Yes, this is Matt. We actually showed in terms of rent what we expect to expire over the balance of the year. It's on the NOI, NOI step up chart as part of the presentation is a $5 million that's included so of what expire we expect about $5 million and annual base rent not to renew as of today.","Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Bill, can you give us an update on where things stand with the CEO search overall in the timing thereof? Thanks.","A. William Stein","Ross, we are happy to. I mean as I said on the last call the board, our board is comfortable with the leadership that\u2019s in place. I think that comfort has been validated by what I would say has improved employee, customer and investor confidence both on the equity side and the fixed income side. I think it\u2019s interesting to note that since the change in leadership we\u2019ve recovered almost $2 billion of market cap for our shareholders. So the board continues to be focused on sourcing the right candidate for the job, but nevertheless the timing is still expected to be this year and meanwhile this team is focused on executing the strategic vision, which we played out to be optimizing the return on portfolio recycling capital and unleashing the intellectual capital of the firm.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Hello good afternoon everyone. Just want to go back to the new lease pricing in the US which dropped down to 130 per square foot I know a lot of that was attributed to the particular markets in the U.S., which are lower-priced in general. Just curious those three markets what percentage of within those three was all of it?","A. William Stein","","So Vin, The drop as you said, the drop in rates is all market. North America, I think from North America perspective quarter-to-quarter in the first quarter 44% I think of our TKF GAAP rents came from Toronto while in second quarter 48% came from Dallas and Phoenix. It\u2019s actually give you an idea of a rough makeup in the North America since globally in Q1, we had some very large deals in APAC and EMEA about 62% of rents coming in across APAC and EMEA in the first quarter and again that comes back to North America in the second quarter about 75% of the rents.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","","Great, okay. And then, I\u2019m sorry, you also mentioned, I think Northern Virginia being a fairly big part of the mix this quarter, what was that percentage of leases?","A. William Stein","","Yes, so in Northern Virginia was \u2013 there was sizable lease in the quarter and I\u2019m just going to back into that number I\u2019ve got to get that number for you. And I don\u2019t have in front of me.","Vincent Chao \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","You mentioned the quarterly same capital growth NOI growth was 5.8% was exceeded expectations. Can you just talk a little bit about what the upside was relative to the expectations and the implied guidance at the midpoint suggests some slowing from the 5.8% that we saw here in the second quarter just curious if that's really what you're expecting us to see or maybe your trending towards the higher end of that range?","A. William Stein","Yes, I mean it\u2019s obviously that\u2019s just one quarter comparison. I think that\u2019s why we also stated with the year-to-date growth was which is clearly in the middle of where we\u2019re guiding and right now we are comfortable that with the year-to-date it reflects clearly accurately where we expect to be coming end of the year.","Scott E. Peterson","","And Vin, just to get back to you on Northern Virginia Q2 it\u2019s about 10%.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks, I guess good evening at this point or good afternoon. Just two questions, I guess on the Turn-Key joint venture Bill, what exactly or the goals if you want to get out of that. Is it too kind of established pricing and kind of core markets for yourself? Is it to eliminate some of the smaller markets that your end or markets really have one or two assets, I guess what\u2019s the immediate goal of that joint venture?","A. William Stein","","There are two goals, Steve. The first is I think it\u2019s prudent for any company to diversify its capital sources. And so we clearly have access to public and private debt and access to public common debt and preferred this we believe will give us access to reliable source of private capital. In addition, we expect this will provide some transparency on private market valuations from a sophisticated investor for our Turn-Key product. And we think that\u2019s important as well particularly for the any devaluation of the analyst community and our investors.","Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","But I guess from a market perspective where you looking to kind of proven in the Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago are you looking the kind of sell maybe in the Boston, and in the St. Louis where you have one, two assets and maybe those markets on quite a score.","Scott E. Peterson","","At this point the BOEs when we proven the non-core markets that will be throughout right sale. The joint venture would be in core markets really want to retain an interest and retain management of the asset. And each joint venture \u2013 this joint venture is being structured in the similar way to the prudential joint venture with retained 20% interest as management and property management fees as well as promote on cash flow in back end.","Operator","The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Bejjani \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Hey, guys is that kind of $20 million or so quarterly G&A run rate is that fully incorporating the mid market sale teams up or how much further do you see this growing?","Matt Miszewski","","Yes, the G&A numbers do have baked into them, the entire mid market sales additions, so we\u2019ve completed that process from a mid market perspectives, across G&A in total we do anticipate that we\u2019ll see a mild increase this year that also important to remember that this is already baked into guidance. And I would like to point out as the head of sales and marketing that additional cost in my area always result in higher revenue. So we continue to see great steady progress on our strategic plan.","John Bejjani \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Great, thanks and just one quick follow-up on the Turn-Key JV, you guys have been talking about this for a better part of the year at this points, is there anything you can show on the status there and what\u2019s the delay, let\u2019s call delay at this point.","A. William Stein","","John I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d say there is a delay, we\u2019ve taken out multiple counter parties, we have identified one counter party, terms have been negotiated, and now that you have the process of sourcing debt as well and all the conditions that are associated with the debt arrangement. So I think we\u2019re making good progress and I think perhaps there was a bit of delay earlier in the year, as we were looking at generating capital from asset sales. But now, we\u2019ve more or less side the asset sale program and have a sense for the sequence there. And we have a view as to how the joint venture would fit into that program.","Operator","The next question will come from Jon Peterson of MLV & Company. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co","Great. Thank you. Just a quick question on the guidance (indiscernible), but in terms of dispositions obviously that have pretty wide range I know you said you are going to give more details after Labor Day, but on the cap rate the ranges from 0% to 12%. I was hoping you guys kind of elaborate on what to expect, obviously 0% assets to negative cash flow. I\u2019m just curious what percent of 0 to 400 would kind of fall in that bucket. I guess how do I think about that really wide range and what you guys see it realistically following now that?","Scott E. Peterson","","Yes. I apologies for the wide range as you can imagine it's kind of tough to try to ballpark that it's a little early in the process to nail it down. But I think it's reasonable to expect that the average cap rates for the dispositions will be below our employee portfolio cap rate. Is that helps.","Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co","Okay. All right, that\u2019s fair. And then go ahead.","A. William Stein","","No, that\u2019s okay.","Jonathan Petersen \u2013 MLV & Co","Okay. And then in terms of debt maturity is just hoping for an update you got about $130 million of secured debt maturing I think alone in November of this year and $375 million of unsecured notes in July of next year. Just what can we kind of expect in terms of how you guys plan to refinance that debt?","Matt Miszewski","","Yes, sure. This is Matt. Over the balance of this year, our thinking is we\u2019ll effectively repay most of the secured debt that's maturing through our revolver. We do have in our guidance and additional capital raise and additional U.S. bond late in the year that you can say effectively would be part of that refinancing.","And then in terms of next year, we are still putting together our capital plan, but I would think we given our rates are today in terms of the large the first bond maturing we have mid-next year that we should be able to refinance that on the longer-term at effectively the same cost. So basically take out of five-year paper with ten-year money. So we feel very confident about our ability to fund the business through 2015 at this point.","Scott E. Peterson","","We\u2019ll be generating a liquidity through asset sales as well as the joint venture we talked about, which will not only \u2013 it\u2019ll pay down debt as well as keep leverage in line.","Operator","The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Thanks. Just wanted to comeback to demand that\u2019s driving sort of the optimism for data center fundamentals that Bill I think you\u2019re referenced in your prepared remarks. Sequentially supply seems to be up a little bit overall with Dallas and Houston up to Silicon Valley up really offset by little bit of decline in Northern Virginia. What can you tell us about what you\u2019re seeing in the demand side particularly, domestically?","A. William Stein","","I\u2019m sure Jordan, well first of all we are constricting our supply and we see supply constricting from others as well. And demand is remained strong impact that might even be stronger than it was six to twelve months ago. So based on that I think, we think market rates will inflect. And then within our own portfolio we\u2019re seeing a positive cash market-to-market in 2015. Well I think it\u2019s important to note here, but there is definite difference between product offerings Matt mentioned that in his prepared remarks.","And by that I\u2019m referring to share versus dedicated and we are seeing significant demand for our dedicated to end product and what would call national markets as well as the other markets while we have finished inventory. And that really lead to start conclusion that fundamentals are improving at least for our product.","Matt Miszewski","And Jordan as you think about the shared back claim versus the dedicated infrastructure. You do not have to search long for approved points, right, largely reported over supply in Northern Virginia but I can't keep the two and dedicated solution that we have there on the shelf same situation in Dallas. So you don\u2019t need to search long and hard to find the approved points that dedicated offering that we have is different and therefore that supply is constricted.","Jordan Sadler \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","","Okay, and then just maybe as a follow-up given sort of the increase in the development spending guidance surrounding sort of this optimism around demand of fundamentals and the significant recovery in the share price that we talked about. How do you feel about raising equity here given sort of where you are in the leverage spectrum positioning the balance sheet for 2015.","Matt Miszewski","","Yes, this is Matt, Jordan I think we said in our prepared remarks with some of the capital recycling initiatives that we have in our way. We don\u2019t currently have any plans to sell equity, we've got a plan for the year that fully funds all of the capital needs that we have keep it inline with the covenants and relevant leverage ratio\u2019s that we like to operate within particular in light of our upward revised stability outlook from S&P. So as of today, we don\u2019t have any plans in guidance to issue any equity.","A. William Stein","And let me Jordan, I mean while the stock has done well, we still think it\u2019s trading on a discount NAV. and we also are looking at significant what we think is a significant growth in NAV due to improving fundamentals, inventory absorption and that\u2019s a value accretion through our development program. So we don\u2019t think it makes sense to sell equity at this level.","Operator","","The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yes. It\u2019s actually Michael Bilerman with Manny in. Bill, you got a pretty good memory from a year and a half ago. I\u2019m curious on the distribution program, the 0 to 400. Is that all encompassing for this review that you did, I think Scott talked about 5% to 10% of the portfolio, which I think would be greater than 0 to 400 in this, they\u2019re are really low valued assets. So I\u2019m just curious sort of how big that portfolio is and whether you want to \u2013 you\u2019re instead after Labor Day, assuming not all the stuff will come in at that point. So can you just sort of give a little bit more color surrounding it?","A. William Stein","","Yes, sure. I think the first part of the question. I kind of lost track here for a minute there, but we planned to initiate the program after Labor Day. So obviously, assets will bring it out. from that point, we\u2019re not going to hit the market with every asset that we intend to \u2013 that we have slated for dispositions at that point. And then I think the question was about the size\u2026","Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","You said 5% to 10%, which to me like greater than zero to 400 million. So I didn\u2019t know whether the basket of assets is identified to eventually look what it was in excess of 400 million.","A. William Stein","Yes. So the basket of the high priority assets is in excess of that, and we\u2019re still finalizing which ones that we\u2019re actually going to be taken the market right after Labor Day.","","Scott E. Peterson","Hey, Michael. let me follow up though, the zero to 400 million are assets that will be sold this year that does not represent 5% to 10% of the portfolio that is slated per sale, that\u2019s just \u2013 that sequencing and timing, that\u2019s what would be sold this year.","Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Right. So what I\u2019m trying to get a picture of is, how I assume you\u2019re going to continue this program to next year, as you said, you want to sell 5% to 10%. how big of a disposition plan to envision happening over the next 12 months to 18 months? We will be talking that 1.5 billion of assets \u2013 2 billion of assets.","Scott E. Peterson","","I mean what I\u2019ve seen Michael, would say 600 million of proceeds roughly.","A. William Stein","Yes. That\u2019s pretty close and that\u2019s probably over the course of the next eight or nine months.","Michael Jason Bilerman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question will be a follow-up from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Just a quick follow-up Page 16 when I take a look at the same-store results, just kind of curious from an OpEx perspective, fairly large increases in utilities and other property operating expenses repair the maintenance and things like that, just kind of curious on why the big year-over-year bond is number one and what we should expect kind of going forward in regards to our run rate?","Matt Miszewski","","Yes. Tayo, this is Matt. There\u2019s a couple of things, I mean some of the \u2013 some of that was as we expected in sort of including guidances, as part of our guidance we gave on margin, some of that is seasonal initiatives for preventative maintenance, to mainly just as a matter of timing. and additionally, as we\u2019ve been rolling out some of the data center services and the ecosystem features that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of that increase, which again, is all baked into the guidance that we provided. and we expect to be within the margins that we laid out as part of that guidance come in the end of the year.","Tayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, all right.","","Matt Miszewski","Thank you.","Operator","","And the next question will be a follow-up from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Thanks guys. I think that\u2019s my second question, I guess maybe for Matt, as you guys have thought about kind of the lease-up potential that it takes for an asset to get from kind of starting point to stabilization. I know that number had kind of got extended out almost 12 quarters and just given the leasing environment that you\u2019re seeing today and that seven months I guess number that you\u2019ve talked about from a tenant signing to sort of taking occupancy. Do you think that 12-quarter stabilization period has shrunk, or is in the process of shrinking and so what do you think the right number is today?","Matt Miszewski","Yes. great question, Steve, I do think that the number is shrinking and what I\u2019m looking for in the data is a pattern I can sort of solidify myself to give you some guidance as to what I think the new number is. There\u2019s a number of things that go into that equation, the gap from signing to deployment is certainly one of those pieces, but the other correction that we made in the sales process helps to speed some of that up as well.","So I would anticipate that we would be able to get to a more crisp number, as to what it takes for us to get fully stabilize on a building over the next few quarters. but it is improving, if I can give you a trend guidance, it\u2019s certainly improving.","A. William Stein","","Steve, that might vary market by market though. So Northern Virginia is pretty brisk at this point and Dallas is brisk, Richardson. As Matt said, we can keep the inventory on the shelf. We built the shelf. we finished the data center and it will be fully leased within 12 months.","Matt Miszewski","And Steve, with the focus of new discipline that we have here you can expect that our focus will remain on increasing that ROIC by leasing existing inventory, but also leasing into the markets that are similarly hot that Bill just described. So you should see, like I said, I think you should see market-to-market differentiation, but you should see a constriction of that time to stabilization.","Steve T. Sakwa \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hey, we just are confusing. it\u2019s Manny here with Michael. I had a quick follow-up on the dispositions. Would you ever consider selling some of those pre-stabilized assets to both help the ROIC, maybe bringing some incremental proceeds and just sort of move that along especially ones that have been on that schedule for a while now?","Matt Miszewski","Yes, absolutely. As a matter of fact, I think that you\u2019ll see that some of that\u2019s around the \u2013 are in the list of high priority candidates.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","And then when you said Matt, earlier $600 million of proceeds, did you mean $600 million gross or net?","Matt Miszewski","There are gross proceeds. I think maybe, in this probably net of sales expenses on that, but pretty close.","Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Got it. thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us.","We had a solid first quarter, and I would like to begin today by providing an update on the progress that we've made towards our strategic priorities, which you can see laid out on The Way Forward slide on page two in the accompanying presentation.","First and foremost, we achieved a 40 basis point sequential improvement in our return on invested capital during the first quarter. This was driven primarily by the burn-off of straight-line rent and consistent lease-up of development projects. This comes on the heels of the 60 basis point improvement that we achieved for the full year in 2014. Given the size of our asset base, we believe that this is a truly remarkable achievement.","I should point out that we have likely realized the bulk of the improvement that we expect to recognize this year in the first quarter, and this measure is likely to plateau for the balance of the year. You can be assured, however, that we are not content to rest on our laurels, and we will continue to strive to optimize the return on our asset base and drive greater profitability on every square foot in our portfolio. Of course Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we achieved solid execution on asset sales at very favorable pricing, harvesting capital to fund significantly higher-yielding investments in our development pipeline and enhancing the quality of our portfolio in the process.","We now have realized $95 million of gain on three asset sales so far this year. As we stated last quarter, we expect gains on non-core assets sales to more than offset the impairment charges we took last year. And we are well on our way to the tipping point. I'm proud of the job that Scott and his team are doing. The execution of our capital recycling strategy is clearly resulting in steady progress towards our objectives.","Shifting gears now to our customers business. It has become clear that the cloud is revolutionizing the delivery of IT across the corporate world. As you know, the corporate enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base, and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable, in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. As you've heard me say on previous calls, the attraction is mutual. And our global footprint, high-quality product and proven operating track record represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio.","We're also adapting our product offering to accommodate diverse IT workloads, incorporating hybrid clouds and value-added vertical solutions. We aim to deliver what our customers want on a global basis, where they want it and add a value in line with their needs. We are making steady progress and we look forward to continuing to update you as we deliver a more agile deployment method.","Moving on to inventory management, as you know, we have made significant headway leasing up our finished inventory and improving the risk profile of our development pipeline in the process. We have reduced our finished inventory balance by 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013. And our active datacenter construction projects, which are expected to deliver stabilized cash yields in double-digits, are currently better than 80% pre-leased. Based on the current positioning of our existing inventory and the strength of our sales pipeline, we are moving forward with new investment in key markets in a disciplined manner.","During the first quarter, we began construction on 12 megawatts across Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas. These projects were 52% leased at quarter-end, but now are 90% leased one month later. We are tracking strong demand from new and existing customers in each of these markets and we are confident in our ability to lease up incremental capacity at attractive returns.","Turning now to our human capital, as most of you are well aware, we have further strengthened our existing senior management team with three key hires over the past few weeks. As mentioned earlier, Andy Power is our new CFO. We have worked with Andy for more than a decade and we look forward to leveraging his capital markets expertise and relationships in the financial community to support our longer-term growth, while prudently managing our balance sheet.","In addition, Jarrett Appleby and Michael Henry recently joined the company as our new Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer respectively. We believe that Jarrett will ensure significant alignment between corporate strategy and operations, while enhancing our ability to deliver the most efficient and effective solutions to our customers. We expect Michael to facilitate the use of information and technology to unlock more value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.","We are confident that new hires of this caliber will serve to deepen our bench and strengthen our culture. With a tailwind of improving datacenter fundamentals at our back and these crucial leadership pieces in place, our entire management team is laser-focused on delivering upon our strategic objectives.","With that in mind, let me pause here for a moment to ask that all of you mark your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day on September 15. At that time, we will be prepared to unveil a comprehensive strategic plan which will go beyond the initial objectives that we outlined for you last year.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results. Matt?","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Thank you, Bill. We reported first quarter 2015 core FFO per share of $1.27, $0.03 ahead of consensus estimates and ahead of our own expectations. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by timing of asset sales as well as repairs and maintenance expense.","On a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share was down a little less than 1% from $1.28 in the first quarter of 2014. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, however, core FFO per share would have been up a little over 2%. As a reminder, roughly three-fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and we are exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the pound and euro, on the remaining one-fourth of our portfolio. As I'm sure you're all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened considerably during the first quarter and our reported earnings were impacted by currency translation swings as shown on page three of the presentation.","The strong dollar shaved approximately 250 basis points off the year-over-year growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and same-capital cash NOI. At the bottom line, FX represents a 300 basis point drag on our year-over-year growth in core FFO per share in both the first quarter as well as full-year forecast.","It is worth recalling that we manage currency risk by issuing locally-denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. We are well hedged with less than 15% of net assets denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies.","In addition, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposes us to currency translation exposure, it enables us to satisfy the international datacenter requirements of global enterprises and cloud service providers, which represents a key competitive advantage.","Turning now to page four, you can see the $0.05 impact from the additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the first quarter, represented by the red block. This additional currency headwind has been almost entirely offset by later closing on asset sales than initially projected.","As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising our core FFO per share guidance by $0.03, entirely due to an increase to our sales plan. The narrowing of the gap to 3.7 months between the signing and commencement date on first quarter leasing, along with a strong start to the second quarter, have already enabled us to hit nearly two-thirds of our initial target for incremental revenue from speculative leasing. Consequently, we are raising the incremental revenue target by an additional $5 million, which accounts for the $0.03 raise to core FFO per share guidance.","Incidentally, we have also added two new rows to our guidance table to more clearly spell out the progression of incremental revenue from speculative leasing. We're also introducing core FFO per share guidance on a constant currency basis of $5.18 to $5.28, which represents year-over-year growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. Investment activity will always be a wild card, but going forward, we expect our sustainable growth rate to look more like constant currency guidance than as reported.","Turning now to operating performance, same-capital occupancy was in line with previous quarters at 93.4% and we have had success backfilling the very modest vacancy uptick from the first quarter. The total portfolio occupancy decline was anticipated and was flagged on our fourth quarter earnings call.","We commented last quarter that we have several known move-outs in 2015 and we expected portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third quarter before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year. The primary driver of the first quarter occupancy decline was a non-tech lease expiration at 1900 South Price Road in Phoenix, which was underwritten at acquisition as a redevelopment project with the expectation that this tenant would vacate when its lease expired. Our cost basis in this property is a little over $100 per square foot and the expiring rent was $13 per square foot. This asset is adjacent to our 2121 South Price Road property and we will continue to monitor market conditions to determine when it may be appropriate to start the next phase on our Phoenix campus.","Shifting gears to leasing activity. Cash rents on renewal leases signed during the first quarter rolled down 3% on a cash basis, but rolled up 10% on a GAAP basis. Matt Miszewski will cover releasing spreads in greater detail in his remarks. Same-capital cash NOI was up just 0.6% during the first quarter. As shown on page three of the presentation, FX represented a 250 basis point headwind. And on a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI growth would have been a little over 3%.","The same-capital growth rate was also negatively impacted another 80 basis points by a reserve related to pre-petition rent for Net Data Centers, a tenant at two of our properties in L.A. which filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter. Since filing for bankruptcy, the tenant has remained current on all post-petition scheduled base rent obligations and we received May rent yesterday.","For the full year, we now expect same-capital cash NOI growth to trend toward the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but toward the lower end of the range on an as-reported basis. Incidentally, we have revised our 2015 mark-to-market guidance from slightly positive to slightly negative on a cash basis. However, this is entirely due to the early renewal of an above-market 2016 lease expiration and not due to any erosion in market rents. To the contrary, we see modest improvement in face rates and meaningful improvement in net effective rents.","As you can see on page five, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.0 times as of the end of the first quarter, half a turn below our target of 5.5 times. Proceeds from asset sales received since quarter-end have been used to further pay down debt. We could conceivably take leverage up to six times in a pinch with a clear plan to bring it back down to 5.5. Based on our existing cash flow stream, levering up by one turn would create nearly $1 billion of borrowing capacity. Of course as we continue to grow EBITDA, the incremental cash flow creates additional borrowing capacity as well.","We recently gave notice of our intent to redeem later this month the $375 million of 4.5% bonds scheduled to mature in July. We continue to believe the current interest rate environment represents an attractive opportunity to lock in longer-term capital at historically low rates. We will look to opportunistically tap the fixed income market to continue to term out debt in a prudent manner and we will evaluate U.S. as well as non-U.S. currency issuance.","Turning now to the chart on page six, the pronounced drop in straight-line rent is one of the key highlights from this quarter's results. The steady downward trend in non-cash rental revenue is a direct reflection of the revamping of our sales compensation program and a more disciplined lease underwriting standards over the last year. We have not traditionally provided guidance on straight-line rent, but the average analyst estimate is approximately $75 million for the full year. We do expect a modest uptick in the quarterly run rate from the $13 million we recognized during the first quarter, but we expect straight-line rent for the full year to come in around $55 million to $60 million, well below the average analyst estimate. This will clearly have a positive impact on AFFO.","The CapEx deductions in our AFFO reconciliation are also down from the fourth quarter. I would like to remind everyone of the more stringent classification of the property level CapEx we announced last quarter. I won't go into the ins and outs of the changes in classification, but for ease of reference, we have provided here on page seven the same detailed explanation we included in the deck last quarter when the change was originally announced. The bottom line is that while there's some movement in terms of geography, the change in presentation does not have a material impact on our 2014 AFFO calculation. And the primary drivers of the improvement in AFFO in the first quarter of 2015 includes lower leasing volume and the previously mentioned burn-off of straight-line rent.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to provide an update on the current datacenter leasing environment.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thank you, Matt. As shown on page eight of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $21 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter. We've stated for the past several quarters that there was a distinct possibility the rationalization of our available inventory, coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline, might impact leasing velocity at some point in the future. That clearly happened in the first quarter. However, we have also maintained that our focus on profitable growth would translate to improved net effective leasing economics, highly targeted capital deployment and better overall returns for our shareholders. That prediction was also borne out in our first quarter results.","As Matt noted in his comments and as you can see from the chart at the bottom of page nine, the weighted average lag between signings and commencements was less than four months in the first quarter. In addition, the average return on our first quarter leasing activity hit the high end of our 10% to 12% return expectations and was over 100 basis points better than the average for the full year of 2014. This is a reflection of both our tighter underwriting discipline and overall improved inventory management as well as the continued firming of datacenter supply and demand fundamentals.","I'm also pleased to report that the second quarter is off to a strong start and we signed another $16 million in the month of April, bringing the year-to-date total to $37 million of annualized GAAP rent. Our mid-market segment contributed $3.8 million to the first quarter signing volume, which represented 18% of our total leasing activity. This is roughly in line with the recent trend, although the contribution this quarter was at the low end of the $4 million to $8 million range we have come to expect from this segment.","I should pause here to point out that we revised our definition of colocation to less than 300 kilowatts to better align our sales force with our customers. As a result, you will see an increase of a little over $20 million in colocation revenue from last quarter's supplemental to the current quarter. Clearly, this is not how we intended to reach our stated objective of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year timeframe. We will continue to update you on the progress towards this goal, and we are frankly a bit behind schedule. The mid-market segment has been punching above its weight, but the rest of the pie is much bigger and is also growing.","The mid-market segment accounted for most, but not all of the 22 new logos we added year-to-date. We also welcomed a large new financial services customer to the fold during the first quarter. Our business mix was slightly skewed as a result, and social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for a little less than half of our first quarter 2015 leasing activity compared to 75% for the full year in 2014. New customers represented 35% of our first quarter lease signings and existing customers accounted for the remaining 65%.","Turning now to page 10, the cash mark-to-market on datacenter lease renewals turned negative for the quarter as the positive cash releasing spreads on Powered Base Building renewals were more than offset by a big turnkey roll down. The primary driver of the negative turnkey mark was an early renewal of a 2016 expiration.","On our third quarter call, we flagged a handful of 2016 rollovers in Northern New Jersey as the worst remaining above-market lease expirations within our portfolio. The early renewal we executed during the first quarter enables us to address a significant chunk of that 2016 Northern New Jersey rollover.","You can see from the inset chart here on page 10 that while the current year expected turnkey cash releasing spread drops from negative 2% to negative 6%, the expected 2016 mark-to-market improves from negative 12% to negative 2%. This early renewal was with a large and growing customer for an additional five years beyond the 2016 expiration. There is no change to the in-place rent prior to the original expiration date and the transaction did not require any tenant improvements. While we would certainly prefer to see all of our leases roll up at expiration, this is a positive overall outcome and a testament to the strength of our long-standing customer relationships.","We leased a total of 11 megawatts during the first quarter, roughly one-third of which was finished inventory although it was offset by deliveries and expirations, so the finished inventory balance ticked up slightly to 25 megawatts. Nonetheless, the balance is still down 40% since our Investor Day in November 2013.","Turning now to supply, as you can see here on page 12, we saw some additional positive net absorption in the Silicon Valley market during the first quarter. You can see represented on the chart here some modest new construction underway in the Chicago market over the last 90 days, but on balance, market conditions are generally in equilibrium. The current supply environment remains rational and broadly supportive of continued gradual improvement in datacenter fundamentals.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Thank you, Matt. As Bill alluded to in his comments, we are achieving solid execution on our capital recycling initiative.","We've closed on the sale of three non-core assets so far this year, totaling over $205 million and generating gains on sale of approximately $95 million. The weighted average cap rate on the two income-producing properties was 5.7%. Last quarter, we announced the sale of 100 Quannapowitt, a non-datacenter property in suburban Boston, to a regional investor for $184 per square foot at a 5% cap rate. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we recognized a $10 million gain on the sale during the first quarter. We also sold a vacant former datacenter in Southern California to an industrial developer for $14 million or $206 per square foot. This sale generated net proceeds of approximately $14 million and we recognized an $8 million gain in the first quarter.","Last week, we closed on the sale of 833 Chestnut, a high-rise building in Center City, Philadelphia, for $161 million or $228 per square foot at an 8.5% cap rate on our 2015 contractual cash NOI. The sale is expected to generate net proceeds of approximately $150 million and we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $77 million in the second quarter. A portion of this property had been built out as datacenter, but the bulk of the tenancy was healthcare-related, a reflection of a vibrant university research and hospital cluster in the immediately surrounding area. The building was marketed for sale as a medical office building and the buyer was a leading healthcare REIT.","Proceeds from these asset sales have initially been used to pay down the balance on our line of credit, but will ultimately be redeployed into our core business, primarily funding our development pipeline. We expect to earn stabilized cash yields in the 10% to 12% range on our development projects which we believe represents a very attractive spread relative to the exit cap \u2013 cap rates on our asset sales.","In addition to the three non-core properties we have sold to date, we are actively marketing three assets for sale and we expect to bring another five to market as a portfolio package during the second quarter. The rest of the properties targeted for sale are currently undergoing various value-add efforts. We believe this approach will result in better proceeds for our investors, which is the primary objective of our capital recycling program.","And now, I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for his closing remarks.","Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Scott. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our first quarter 2015 highlights as outlined here on page 14. First and foremost, we picked up another 40 basis points of improvement in our return on invested capital followed by the 60 basis point improvement we delivered in 2014. We achieved favorable execution on our capital recycling program with the sale of three non-core assets, realizing approximately $95 million of gain on sale and generating $190 million of net proceeds, which we expect to redeploy at attractive spreads. I also want to point out here that the cap rate on 833 Chestnut was 5.8%. I believe Scott said 8.5%. So...","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Oh, did I? Sorry about that.","Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer","The balance sheet remains positioned for growth with debt to EBITDA at five times. We beat first quarter consensus estimates by $0.03 and we raised 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.03 based on the strength of our leasing pipeline. And finally, with the remaining critical pieces now in place, the entire senior leadership team is laser-focused on execution. In short, we continue to consistently execute on our top priorities that we set forth early last year and have since updated as the way forward for our company in 2015. We believe that we have a unique, competitive footprint that can be leveraged further to the benefit of our shareholders.","I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter. Once again, I'd like to remind you all to mark September 15 on your calendars for our upcoming Investor Day.","And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Terrific. Thanks. I think you mentioned a few reasons for the reduced lag between signing and commencement, which is great to see. But the press release seems to suggest that it's the robust demand and the shrinking supply as part of the reason. And I want to make sure I understand that element of it. Is it that better supply and demand dynamic gets tenants to commence faster because of the competition for that space? Or is it really the other factors that you mentioned that are driving the shorter time interval there?","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, Vance. I believe that you got it right. Primarily, the demand and supply characteristics are driving folks to do a few things, first of all, to make commitments a little bit earlier than they had before, but also to make sure that they're deploying those ideas in a faster way as well. So that reduced supply and that increased demand that our customers are feeling across the datacenter industry is really helping to reduce that lag.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then for my follow-up, on the 833 Chestnut sold post the quarter, I understand that it was non-core. But do you have a feel for how much of the upside from the building was left on the table? In other words, the 5.8% cap rate based on this year's expected NOI, was it your impression that those numbers were going to grow in 2016 and beyond given the vibrant nature of that market as you describe it?","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","It would grow a little bit in 2016, there's some free rent that's going to burn off, so you have contractual bumps in all of that. There'd been a big expansion from the hospital there which really took up the bulk of the vacant space here, so there's a little bit of upside left there, but really to a large extent, the building was pretty well stabilized.","Operator","The next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about M&A, there's been quite a few transactions happening in this space. Earlier comments that were made seems like you guys are looking to grow your colocation business even faster. As you indicated, you feel like you're a little bit behind. So just kind of curious whether M&A is a solution to this? Or whether you still think you can build it organically to hit your target?","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. As you can imagine, we see all the transactions that are out in the marketplace and we look at and evaluate all of them. We try to judge them by their strategic fit and value to our company as well as whether they represent an attractive investment for our shareholders. We'll continue to judge all future opportunities that way. And certainly, we'll look at every M&A opportunity that's out in the marketplace.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And Tayo, this is Matt. So in terms of whether we see the growth on the colocation product in inorganic or organic, we see a significant amount of potential organic growth, and so that certainly frees the rest of the company up to make smart decisions on the M&A front.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just one follow-up on that point, I mean I assume you guys saw all the transactions that have happened or are going to be happening. Is there anything thematically that made any of those \u2013 that made all those acquisitions unattractive to you? Was it really pricing, was it really the product mix?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. I think generally, if you look at the transactions that have occurred to date, they haven't had a great strategic fit, and we can look at Cervalis as one. It was concentrated in the Northeast, had a lot of financial services customers there, both of which we have a great deal of exposure to between the geographic exposure in our portfolio as well as financial services firms, so it didn't really represent a strategic opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation and available capacity. I know that during, Bill, your prepared remarks and Matt, yours as well, you talked a little bit about inventory. I think you mentioned 25 megawatts of available capacity. But you also mentioned that you had built out or were in the process of building 12 megawatts in four markets, which you identified for us last quarter as markets that you'd be willing to speculatively put capital into, Silicon Valley, Chicago, northern Virginia and Dallas, and that now, 90% of that capacity was leased. So maybe if you could just kind of bring us up to date on your willingness to add speculative capacity to certain markets. And with, I guess, 1.2 megawatts of available capacity from the construction pipeline in those four markets, maybe some perspective on those four markets in particular. Thanks.","Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Jonathan. We try to stay ahead of demand in the markets where we have great visibility on demand. And so, I think you can see us adding a new shell in Northern Virginia. In fact that's under construction right now. We have a site in Singapore as well. It's a redevelopment site. And that will hopefully be delivered by the end of this year or early next year. And so we, as I said, we have good visibility and \u2013 because of the partnership that we have with our clients and we try to match their demand around the world.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And, Jonathan, in the other core markets, we see continued demand, but the uptick of space and demand in Dublin in particular, as well as Amsterdam in Western Europe, become interesting targets but the four that we named really are the priorities with Singapore coming up right up behind it.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Great. I guess as a follow-up, I'm going to ask a different question, but is there a special dividend coming given all the gains on the asset sales? Thanks.","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Yeah. Hi, Jonathan. This is Matt. I mean we'll evaluate the dividend as we move through the year. But right now, we're not projecting any special dividend at this time. And we'll evaluate it once we get a little through the year and some of the additional dispositions come to fruition.","Operator","The next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. When I look at the first quarter GAAP new lease revenue signings, call it $20ish million, I know you cited that you had an increased focus on return on invested capital. But is that really any different than the focus that you had in, call it, the second half of last year when you were doing, call it, almost double that leasing activity? So I guess I'm just sort of wondering, did anything change in terms of getting even more conservative? Or did everything that you've been sort of working toward the last year start really sort of clicking in a bit more in the first quarter?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thanks, Ross. You made the room laugh because I'm the only liberal in the entire organization, so I'm hoping that it didn't tip to being more conservative. In essence, the question you're asking is, is there something that's different in the fundamentals, are the fundamentals potentially weakening? I really and truly believe that that's not true. You saw some of that conviction come through in the revenue-based beat and raise that we put out, but even more importantly, the discipline \u2013 the conservative nature of the discipline we do now have has led us to close deals when they're right for Digital Realty and not simply right for the calendar. And so, I'm thrilled that in April we were able to close an additional $16 million in GAAP, bringing the total around $37 million. And I am actually looking at my phone because there's an additional $2 million in GAAP that's in processing right now. So April was another sign that there is significant strength and that strength continues in the market.","In addition, I was comfortable, as comfortable as I can be, raising guidance on our incremental revenue from speculative leasing based upon the progress that the team has made to date as well as that shortened lag time between signings and commencements, getting it down to about 3.7 is impressive. I'm thrilled to say that so far in Q1, we've improved that lag number even better. In addition, we've got some better visibility into the year, so I'm able to make that commitment and be comfortable raising guidance on incremental revenue because of that visibility.","So the team has been \u2013 would I like the Q1 new lease signings number to have been stronger? Certainly. But the team has been successful in shrinking inventory, having 100 basis points improvement on return on invested capital for Q1 as opposed to 2014, and continuing to burn off the old incentives program and lowering straight-line rent I think are some great metrics that show some strength in this industry.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to talk a little more about colo versus wholesale, and I don't want to take \u2013 steal the thunder from your Investor Day this fall, but it smells a little like, Bill, you're thinking about making a significant strategic shift here in moving the company away from being sort of a more traditional plain vanilla wholesale player into a datacenter company that's a little more, I'll call it, vertically diversified, if you will, am I going too far that it smells like this is a pretty big strategic change you're thinking about?","Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer","Well I mean we haven't been 100% wholesale for a while, not since we bought 365 Main. We've had a retail component to the mix, and so I wouldn't say that there's a revolution underway in the strategy. I think there could be an evolution in our strategy. Jarrett Appleby has joined us because he clearly has some deep expertise in that area. And I would expect that we'll be able to generate some additional revenue from new products and services sold to the existing footprint as well as new customers.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And, Ross, I think it's important to \u2013 there's a couple of dynamics that may look to be shifting. The difference in colo and wholesale is one of the shifts to pay attention to, but the new delivery methodology that we're embracing will enable new vertically-oriented solution sets and differentiated IT workloads to land inside our current facilities and inside any of our brand-new facilities with a lot more ease.","Operator","And the next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. We've been hearing more about customers coming in with a wider range of redundancy requirements, which is kind of driving greater variability in base rates and making pricing comparisons a little more difficult. I'm wondering just how much of this you're seeing within your customer base? And how it might be impacting underwriting or perhaps how you look at risk-adjusted returns?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. So, Matthew, we have seen a number of different requirements come from our customers. Generally, when they talk about them, they'll talk about them in business terms. But the core behind it will be a difference in resiliency that in the past, we haven't necessarily been able to hit. Currently and in the future, we now will be able to hit because \u2013 not because of a new product, but because we're deploying an entirely different method as we move forward. So that new deployment methodology will allow us to satisfy our customers' needs with regard to resiliency, whether it be 2N, which is a fantastic business that we have and a fantastic business that we will have going forward, whether it be N+1 on certain components or even in the rare case, that it'll be an N componentry organization that we need to address. The flexibility of our new deployment methodology will allow us to do that.","Now there will be some adoption timing, right, so we'd need to build out in this new way and deploy in this new way. We expect the impact to start showing up in the fourth quarter of this year and in early 2016. But it will really enable Digital to finally globally deliver what our clients want, where they want it at a value in line with their needs. And as Bill said in his comments, this is really designed to accommodate these diverse IT workloads that people are now trying to locate with different resiliency requirements, incorporate hybrid cloud in the planning as well as to allow us to address some value-added vertical solutions that we're going to be able to bring to market. So really, this provides the openness and agility that our clients have been asking from us in order to accelerate their growth. So we're really just focused on meeting customer needs.","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Matthew, if I can add to that from an underwriting perspective. We are highly focused on the different requirements that our customers will ask us, particularly you see this a lot in build-to-suits, whether that's increase redundancy or lower redundancy. And we're very focused on \u2013 do we have to amortize specialized improvements over the leased term or do we have to expect that we're going to have some capital expenditures at the end of the lease term to raise the quality level of the facility. So we're very focused on it and include it in our underwriting.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious if currency volatility is at all impacting your investment decisions in terms of overseas development? And I guess whether we might see an acceleration in European or Asia Pac expenditures to kind of take advantage of the stronger dollar?","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Yeah. I mean this is Matt. In terms of the currency volatility, I mean, that's what, like we mentioned in the remarks, we're able to hedge our investments in any currency that we've deployed and we'll continue to do that, so we're looking primarily for the best investment return we can because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly throughout the world as we've demonstrated, being 83% plus hedged on all our foreign assets today. So we, again, we look at it from where we can deploy capital and get the best return and because we know that we'll be able to hedge that investment properly and reduce the risk accordingly.","Operator","The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. So I wanted to go back to the M&A discussion a little bit. There was a reference in the response I think by you, Scott, regarding strategic fit. And I guess I'm curious, as we think about potential investment opportunities going forward, M&A or otherwise, are you guys focused more on product and\/or geographic diversity and sort of strategic changes to the portfolio? Or would it be more like the DLR we knew from years past where these were sort of bolt-on accretive acquisitions?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. There are kind of two answers to that. So I think if you were looking at a more horizontal integration where we bought another datacenter provider that it could be a lot easier to view that as a bolt-on acquisition that might be more financially oriented, although we have to be very careful given the current valuations in the market that we're underwriting the assets that we're getting accurately and keeping in mind all the potential risks that are associated there. I think if you're looking at something that might be considered more vertical, then the discussion focuses initially a lot more on the strategy. And I think if you look at a lot of the trades that have occurred in the market, they've been regionally concentrated, maybe secondary markets, don't necessarily integrate well in our geographic portfolio or their specific assets may not match up as well.","In addition to that, you look a lot at the platform and the people that are running it and how attractive are they to your organization and how well would they integrate. Lattices would be a good example of one; great asset, fits geographically, like the company, all the senior leadership team was going to leave and really didn't get a platform with that. And so, I think when you look \u2013 everyone's been a little bit different when you look at them, but there hasn't been a really great fit in those sorts of companies that have come to market. And so, it's been more of that than really a valuation argument so far.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. As a follow-up, I guess, for Bill, I mean, how important is accretion today in an investment opportunity given sort of where you are positioned today or how you may want to be positioned as you look at opportunities? Does it have to be FFO accretive? Or how should we be thinking about it?","Arthur William Stein - Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer","We certainly have a strong preference for investments being FFO accretive. We obviously would look at efficiencies that could be achieved, both on the operating side and the capital side, but we do believe that any investment we make for our shareholders should be accretive.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi, guys. Just want to go back to the conversation about some of the more flexible deployments that you're going to be offering in the future here. So I think there was an expectation of some product being available in the third quarter. Just curious if there's anything that you can share with us in terms of demand for that product, if there's any marketing going on yet in terms of what you're going to be offering the market and just how that's being received.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah, Vince, so a couple of things. We did business requirements gathering on the front side of what I won't call product development, but is a new deployment methodology that we have. So we met with our customers early to figure out if there was a significant amount of revenue on the table that we were missing. And we're clearly satisfied that there was and that there would be a good product market fit for the new solutions that we're bringing to market. So we did that on the front side. And then as we deploy, similar to in software, there's a big of an agile method that we've done in order to get some proof of concepts out, some early thinking on what that design could be. That's what you heard us reference in terms of potential 3Q availability of what we would call internally a new methodology. You're going to see some of that new product hit the market before the end of the year, and then you should see sufficient amounts of it at Q4 and then moving into 2016.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And just going back to the M&A conversation, so we talked Lattices, Cervalis and why maybe those didn't fit strategically. Just curious, Telx is out there, potentially exploring options. Can you talk about the strategic fit there and how that might or might not fit?","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. I think \u2013 well, you don't know anything more about the Telx opportunity than we do. There's an article that's been written. There's nothing out there right now to address directly. I think it's reasonable to assume that there's some compelling strategic rationale around that. But beyond that, it's impossible to make any other further comments until there's something to look at.","Operator","Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Matt, maybe just \u2013 so that I'm understanding this correctly, you guys did $21 million of leasing in the quarter. But if I look at your backlog commencement schedule, it looks like a lot of that is going to be commencing in 2016 and 2017, and I was wondering how you reconcile that to the 3.7 months average commencement timing?","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","I don't \u2013 I mean, I don't think that's \u2013 we'll have to go through the details of the backlog because things shift. But like you said, the \u2013 since the average lag is 3.7 months, the majority of that leasing in the first quarter we expect to commence this year. And again, that's why we've increased the sales guidance for the year and is what's contributing to our raise in core AFFO guidance as well.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then to switch topics back to 365 Main for a second, the actual 365 Main asset looks like it's been losing occupancy for the last three years. Is there something happening there that's underlying that vacancy increase? Or is something else going on?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","So 365 Main \u2013 first, 365 is a more of a pure play in the colocation market than we have anywhere else in our portfolio, and so there certainly is churn management that they have to do there, that we don't have to do elsewhere. We've also been very happy to see expansions coming in from the existing client base that we have at 365. And then the last piece is that with the installation of AMS-IX and eventually other Open-IX initiatives, we fully expect 365 will be able to take advantage of the new connectivity options that we have there and the new open infrastructure that we have, which will allow for new providers, new content providers that had historically not located within that facility to be able to install inside 365. So we think that while it's a little bit different than our traditional properties, we've got a pretty good plan and we're working that plan pretty well.","Operator","The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I guess first on the dispositions, I appreciate with the cap rate information; we could buy back into it. But I was hoping you could tell us how much core FFO is associated with the properties that you're selling? And then you mentioned, I guess earlier on, John, about softball questions for Jarrett. And I guess I'd throw one out there. And I was wondering, Jarrett, based on where you've worked historically, or at least previously, what are some of the low-hanging-fruit opportunities you see with DLR in terms of transitioning their colocation strategy perhaps a little bit aggressively? Matt mentioned during his comments that they're a little bit behind schedule. Just curious if you see anything that you think could put them back on schedule? Thanks.","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Yeah. So in terms of the dispositions we've closed to date, that's impacting core FFO around $0.04 for the year, $0.04 to $0.05 in \u2013 so that's the impact for this year. And then in terms of full-year impact for what we expect to sell in terms of our total capital plan, it's around $0.07, but that obviously depends on the ultimate timing of the sales of the rest of those properties in that disposition plan.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is that an annualized number \u2013 the $0.07, I'm sorry, is that an annualized number of $0.07? Or is that based on the timing you guys have already assumed in your own guidance?","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Yeah. That's the fiscal year 2015 impact, so it reflects the timing of the sale.","Operator","Our next question...","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Colby...","Operator","I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I was just going to answer Colby's question, operator. In terms of the second part, just week three into the journey with Digital, one is from a culture side, I think the solutions are evolving. But in the theme of hockey season, go where the puck is going. I've been looking at Digital for quite a long time. And in terms of this opportunity, I'm pleasantly surprised with where the future of particularly the cloud, compute and service providers are going and where they live.","So if you look at the Digital Realty campuses, these are really enabling hybrid cloud. And I think there's some great opportunities for connectivity options. I just was on a wonderful tour for the grand opening with Rackspace in the UK and seeing the capabilities there. I hope to apply the knowledge I've had over the last seven years in this space in terms of really driving some of the product engine around the solutions that we have and taking great advantage of the team we have here and the assets. So we'll definitely be working on that this summer as a team and talk about it at Analyst Day.","Operator","The next question will come from John Bejjani of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thank you. It looks like you guys reduced your earn-out contingency on the Centrum portfolio by roughly $45 million in the quarter. Can you explain why this change was so large? And more generally, how has the Centrum portfolio performed the past few years relative to your underwriting?","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. Sure, John. I'd be happy to address that. The answer's a little longer than I think you're going to hope for. It really has to do with the structure of the original deal, the accounting treatment of the earn-out. And then finally, I can address the asset performance.","But when we acquired the Centrum portfolio, a central component of that was we only paid for the income-producing portions of the portfolio. And so, we paid a multiple based on the EBITDA that was in place. So essentially we got all of the vacant space for free. So a big part of the negotiation was well, how do we come up with a value for the vacant space? And we arrived at this earn-out methodology, which had a three-year tail on it. And there was a calculation as to how we might pay for that additional space as it was leased. So the good part about that is you actually get all that vacant space for free. And now that that earn-out period is expiring in July, whatever hasn't been leased at that point is going to be ours for really zero basis on that within the construct of the deal.","From an accounting perspective, we have to have a reserve for the earn-out. So you have to be conservative in the way you run those calculations. And you calculate your reserve based on leasing all of the space. So we had to assume that it all got leased. Well, at this point with it burning off in July, there's no reasonable expectation of any additional events that would give rise to an earn-out payment. So as a result, we were able to unwind that reserve.","As it relates to the asset performance, it's performing better than when we acquired it. It's performing better than underwriting. And so we're extremely happy with the performance of it both to date and in the future.","John Bejjani - Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up, can you speak to supply\/demand dynamics in London and your key European markets more broadly?","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. So John, the supply and demand characteristics in London are roughly in equilibrium right now, so we're happy with the pricing position that we've got in London. Of course we just launched the Rackspace, as Jarrett mentioned in his comments. We just launched the Rackspace piece in Crawley, UK and we do have some available dirt there as well. Across the rest of Continental Europe, we see consistency with the comments that I just made with regard to supply and demand in the UK, with sufficient balance within Amsterdam, as well within France where we have a small amount of market-ready inventory left. And then a little bit of a distortion in parts of Germany where there is a little bit of excess demand and not exactly enough supply to satisfy the market dynamics there.","When you push out to the edge, components of the datacenter industry, there may be a little bit of distortion out towards the edge simply because we \u2013 the datacenter industry in Europe as well as the datacenter industry in the United States haven't focused on that over the past decade, but I would expect that picture to clear up in the next five years.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. I'm wondering if you can maybe help us think through the shape of the year from an FFO standpoint just as you look at what your leasing pipeline looks like, the churn that you talked about in third quarter and the more extended timeline on some of the asset divestitures. And then second, just a quick follow-up on Telx; I'm wondering if you can maybe just comment on how you view any potential risk to that relationship if that asset were to fall in someone else's hands. Thanks.","Matt Mercier - Senior Vice President of Finance","Yeah. So this is Matt. In terms of the FFO outlook for the year, I mean yeah, as we noted, we overachieved on even our expectations for the first quarter. And as we noted, a lot of that was due to disposition timing as well as some timing on repairs and maintenance. So as that pushes out as evidenced by 833 Chestnut, which sold in the second quarter, along with some catch-up on some R&M that wasn't spent in the first quarter, we're looking at the second quarter as well as some additional G&A that usually comes as a result of some of the board grants that are issued and vest immediately and that usually happens annually in the second quarter. We're expecting a slight downtick in the second quarter and then sort of a hockey stick from there as all the backlog leasing kicks in and the rest of the speculative leasing that we expect to \u2013 expect to sign commences. So we're looking at accelerated back half of the year.","Matthew J. Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And, Stephen, with regard to your question about what that shape of the pipeline looks like, we can give you advanced look of shape of the pipeline in our Large Enterprise segment and the square footage \u2013 it seems that just about once a year, I update this, the square footage existing in the pipeline for Large Enterprise sales remains roughly equivalent to what it was about 12 months ago. But we did of course add additional streams of income, including the mid-market attack and colo products. So we see some potential improvement, especially over Q1 as we move forward. That visibility was part of what allowed us to beat and raise. And then the last piece is that with some of Jarrett's involvement, we've been able to uncover and unlock certain additional cash performance that should help us to increase revenue per square foot in the existing portfolio that we have. So the shape \u2013 if this was the State of the Union, I would say the State of the Union is strong.","Scott E. Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","And on the last point, first of all, Stephen, I'd like to compliment you on getting three questions in on your one question there. But the last one on Telx, we don't view that somebody else acquiring them poses a significant risk. That relationship and economics are governed under contracts and we view that as being an extension of the status quo.","Stephen W. Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great.

Please note this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp; and SVP of Sales & Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","The management may make forward -looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results. First of all, we set a new high watermark with quarterly bookings north of $60 million. Second, we beat consensus by nearly 4%, driven by consistent operational out performance and we've raised guidance by $0.05 at the low end. Third to beat in race, flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018. Last but not least, we expect to achieve this growth while maintaining our target leverage and self-funding our 2018 capital plan through internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. With our Annual Shareholders Meeting coming up in a little less than two weeks, I'd like to begin today with a discussion on governance, here on page 2 of our presentation. At our Investor Day in December, we shared with you our plan for providing shareholders the ability to amend our bylaws. I'm pleased to report that in early March, our board approved a resolution giving any 3% shareholder or any group of up to 10 shareholders comprising a 3% stake for three years the right to propose binding amendments to the company's bylaws.","We believe that with this step, we are joining a small group of other high-quality REITs and leading the industry with sound corporate governance practices. In keeping with our commitment to ongoing board refreshment, we also disclosed in our proxy that longtime Director, Bob Zerbst will not be standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. In addition to his role on the board, Bob served as Chairman of the Compensation Committee from 2012 to 2017, and as a board representative on our internal investment committee for the past four years. He was also Chairman of the Investment Committee at CBRE Investors, when the initial investment in GI Partners, our private equity predecessor was first approved. On behalf of the entire board, I'd like to extend our thanks to Bob for his years of service to the company.","The governance principle behind our board refreshment philosophy is balancing fresh thinking and new perspectives with experience and continuity. Following Bob's departure, 8 of our 10 directors who have joined the board within the past six years, whereas our Chairman and former Chairman have both served on the board since our IPO. I would also like to remind you that we maintain a de-staggered board, the majority of our directors' compensation is paid in stock, each of our directors maintains a sizable investment in the company, the board and senior management are required to meet minimum stock ownership requirements and finally since 2014, the substantial majority of management's long-term incentive compensation plan has been tied to relative total shareholder return. We believe in eating our own cooking and we manage the business to maximize sustainable long-term value creation for all stakeholders.","Moving on to investment activity. We have already closed on the sale of seven non-core assets year-to-date, generating proceeds of approximately $185 million and realizing gains of a little over $50 million. As Andy will address in his prepared remarks this consistent execution on our capital recycling program has prompted us to raise the high-end of our range for dispositions guidance by an additional $100 million further bolstering our ability to self-fund our 2018 capital plan.","Let's turn to market fundamentals on page 3. In North America data center construction crews remain active across the primary data center metros particularly in Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active metro in the world.","It is also Digital Realty's largest concentration and we are blessed to have 345 megawatts of state-of-the-art capacity on our two existing campuses in addition to 180 acres of strategic land holdings that will support the build-out of another 290 megawatts of future capacity.","The market dynamic in Ashburn is highly competitive and customers have plenty of options to choose from both established players as well as new market entrants. By the same token however demand is both sufficiently robust and diverse to lift a lot of provider boats. New supply is coming online, but is being just as rapidly absorbed. On balance, the North American data center landscape is roughly at equilibrium as you might expect with a national vacancy rate at 10% on the dot.","In Europe hyperscale users continue to dominate the data center league tables representing over 70% of first quarter leasing volume. We estimate that approximately 40 megawatts released across the region in the first quarter largely driven by hyperscale customers expanding in existing locations, London and Amsterdam were the standout metros this quarter followed by Frankfurt. Digital Realty did not have a particularly active first quarter in terms of signed deals, but we did restock the shelves and now have a full complement of inventory in each of the major metros in Europe. We are also off to a strong start in the second quarter having landed a 4 megawatt deployment in Amsterdam in April, our first global deployment with a top legacy DuPont Fabros customer. We expect to see further momentum in Europe over the next several quarters.","In terms of current buying behavior, customers are looking for long-term commitment tied to flexibility and the ability to land and expand within the same location, which lines up perfectly with our Connected Campus strategy. Across the Asia-Pac region demand remains very healthy and is even showing early signs of further acceleration driven by hyperscale users both within the region, as well as Western destinations.","While supply has remained largely in check, several sizeable requirements are prompting potential new entrants to explore new markets. The marketplace remains highly fragmented, which creates barriers to entry especially new geographies for unproven teams. That said, healthy demand dynamic is not yet translating to rental rate growth given the prospect of potential new supply coming to market.","Net-net we believe our customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection product offering as a key differentiator in their selection of data center provider of choice.","Let's turn to the intersection of supply and demand on page 4. Much ado has been made of the pricing and profitability on the recent spate of hyperscale activity and I'd like to take a moment to share our philosophy on pricing and returns.","First and foremost, I would like to remind you that we've always targeted superior risk adjusted returns. Along the X-axis here on page 4, we've outlined the primary risk attributes we underwrite our new-builds. It stands to reason that we would be willing to accept a somewhat lower return on a project that is fully pre-leased to a high credit tenant on a long-term lease as opposed to a speculative new-build. In addition, it should be intuitive that we're able to achieve the lowest unit cost by building at scale or hyperscale, as the case may be.","Finally, evolving customer preferences for higher power density and lower redundancy have enabled us to drive down build costs, shrinking the denominator in the return equation. As a result, we are still able to achieve risk adjusted returns that we consider quite acceptable on hyperscale builds.","The returns on our current pipeline represent a respectable spread above our cost of capital and also represent a very meaningful spread above current cap rates. Unrealized development profit margins are somewhat theoretical, since we have no intention of flipping our core holdings, but we are confident that the returns we are able to achieve on our development pipeline are creating significant value for shareholders.","Let's turn to the macro environment on page 5. The global economic backdrop remains quite supportive and the long-term secular trends driving data center demand seem to be gaining momentum. The Cisco Global Cloud Index forecast that the number of hyperscale data centers will nearly double by 2021. Hyperscale data centers will account for more than half of all installed data center servers by 2021 and traffic within hyperscale data centers will quadruple by 2021.","Digital Realty has the heritage and design expertise to officially meet this demand. Cisco also projects that 69% of the compute and 65% of the data will be housed in hyperscale facilities, which will become the foundation for the evolution of future ecosystems. Software-as-a-Service is expected to be the most popular cloud service model over the next five years and Digital Realty's Service Exchange facilitates secure, private access to critical SaaS applications.","We continue to see a healthy and growing partnership with our large multinational clients resulting in tailored data center solutions for the world's largest and most demanding customers. It is these custom solutions that continue to position Digital Realty and the Connected Campus as the standard for global growth.","Multi-region deployments are growing across all sales verticals, signaling a platform effect from our largest cloud, network and enterprise buyers and further validating the Connected Campus, our full product offering and our role as an international supplier of choice for their critical infrastructure.","Earlier this week, we launched support for Google Cloud's Partner Interconnect, a new service from Google Cloud that allows customers to connect to Google Cloud Platform from anywhere. Partner Interconnect provides customers with the ability to extend private on-premises networks from Digital Realty data centers to the Google Cloud Platform, reaching a broad set of public and private cloud-based service offerings. The new offering will enable our service exchange customers to reach Google Cloud Platform services in nine global metros with additional markets to be brought online later this year.","The Google announcement was just one highlight of a great start to the year and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on the favorable demand setup and deliver sustainable growth for all of our stakeholders, given our global platform, our comprehensive suite of power and connectivity solutions, along with our operational and financial stability.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity, here on page 7. We signed total bookings for the first quarter of $61 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. This marks the fourth quarter out of the past five we've delivered bookings north of $50 million. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $54 million during the first quarter, including a $6 million colocation contribution.","The weighted average lease term on space and power leases signed during the first quarter was approximately eight years. We saw robust and balanced performance of lease signs across every month in the first quarter. We are seeing strong demand from current as well as new customers and we signed 32 new logos during the quarter.","Demand across cloud customers remains strong, with many of the leading global cloud service providers expanding with us. A leading Chinese cloud and technology service provider expanded with us in Ashburn just a couple of quarters after first landing with us in that market. We are pleased with our progress in the enterprise segment, landing broad and diverse customer engagements.","For example, one of the world's largest media entertainment technology and content companies needed immediate access to enterprise quality data center capacity in the red-hot Northern Virginia market to support a new complex cloud-connected application. The customer cited three reasons for selecting Digital Realty; our track record of operational and financial resiliency; the quality of our product and speed of delivery, capacity when and where they needed us; and ease of contracting. And National Cancer Research Institution selected Digital Realty based on our proven track record of operational excellence as well as our interconnection solutions. Their critical business applications will be migrating from another provider and will reside within our secure campus environment in Phoenix. A leading edge personal finance company that is focused on helping everyone make financial progress has selected Digital Realty to consolidate their back-end systems and storage into higher density racks to help future proof their rapid growth.","One of the world's oldest stock exchanges acquired a company in the U.S., and as a result of this acquisition required data center expansion. Digital Realty was awarded one of two North America data center deployments. MOBITV delivers live and on-demand video to any screen connecting media reliably and securely anytime anywhere on any device. The customers connected media solutions solve the complexity of delivering video across networks, operating systems and devices while managing associated rights. MOBITV chose our 250 William Street location in Atlanta to utilize the extremely highly connected 56 Marietta ecosystem as an activation point for their TV channel content to directly connect to end users.","We see continued strength in our network segment. Our first quarter network wins indicate continued strong demand for scale infrastructure in the infrastructure-as-a-service subsector in addition to multi-site colocation and interconnection demand in the content delivery network, Internet service provider, and global carrier subsectors, including a major backbone expansion with one of the largest telecommunication providers in the U.S.","Our strategic alliances and channel referral partner programs continue to help us drive growth and provide a source of new customers. We are gaining traction with partners who want to include our capabilities into the solutions they offer their customers. For example, partnering with Insight one of our alliance partners, helped a customer migrate from a dated architecture as part of an overall technology refresh. We were a perfect fit to offer our colocation interconnection solutions paired with Insight's IT product and service capabilities. So the customer got one comprehensive solution.","With IBM, one of our first strategic alliances, we have been able to embed our capabilities across their direct win products to allow their customers to connect directly to their cloud infrastructure and cloud services. Through this partnership, we drove solutions for our customers throughout our domestic campuses and internationally during the first quarter, strengthening our ecosystem, enhancing our ability to penetrate the enterprise vertical.","As we've discussed on previous calls, we see substantial opportunity for our partners and alliance program to create meaningful upside for our customers and our business over time through our referral, sell-to and sell-with partnership programs. We are pleased with the results to-date and we expect continued growth in 2018.","In terms of integration, our efforts related to the DuPont Fabros merger are winding down. A number of functional areas have completed their project plans and we've made solid progress towards achieving our synergy targets, but we remain focused on closing out all remaining tasks. The outstanding items are primarily related to operations and IT activities with some IT organizational alignment intentionally delayed so as to avoid disrupting the customer experience.","We have successfully completed the migration of all accounting, finance and HR related applications and we will continue to work on the customer portal consolidation and network migration through year-end. We remain on track to meet or exceed our $18 million expense synergy target and we continue to expect the bulk of our integration activities will be wrapped up during the second quarter with loose ends completely tied up by the end of the year.","Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced reached an all-time high of $126 million. The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements was six months reflecting largely signed for space currently under construction and scheduled for delivery later this year.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9, we signed $57 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was over four years and cash rents on renewal leases rolled up 4% with positive cash re-leasing spreads across all product types.","We do still have a few above market leases across the portfolio, most notably within the former DuPont Fabros properties. As a result, the mix of renewal leases signed in any given quarter could push our cash mark-to-market into the red. This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash releasing spreads for the full year in 2018.","In terms of our first quarter operating performance, as we indicated last quarter, overall portfolio occupancy dipped 100 basis points sequentially to 89.2% due to a combination of development projects placed in service along with a churn event in Boston where an enterprise customer is consolidating their data center footprint.","Similar to other opportunities within our portfolio, like the space we took back in Chicago a little over a year ago, a portion of this space will be repositioned to expand our Boston colocation product offering. We also expect portfolio occupancy to rebound beginning in the second quarter, and to finish the year essentially flat at 90% and change.","Turning to our economic risk mitigation on page 10. The U.S. dollar continued to soften during the first quarter and FX represented a slight tailwind to the year-over-year growth in our first quarter results. Interest rates on the other hand continue to rise during the first quarter as shown on the bottom of the page. By way of reminder, we target variable rate debt at less than 20% of total debt outstanding. And we were at 18% as of the end of the first quarter. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long lived assets, long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have just a 1% impact on our 2018 FFO per share. We believe our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well-managed.","Turning to earnings growth on page 11. Core FFO per share was up 7% year-over-year and came in $0.06 above consensus. The upside relative to our internal forecast was primarily driven by operational outperformance and favorable FX. As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising the low end of the range of our 2018 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. Most of the drivers are unchanged except for a 100 basis point increase in the low end of the range for the same-store guidance and updated FX assumptions, partially offset by another $100 million of asset sales.","In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip down slightly in the second and third quarters due to the timing of G&A investments and loss of NOI from recent asset sales as you can see from the bridge on page 12 before rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter as several large leases commence. We do not typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but I would like to point out that as John mentioned, the beat on the FFO line flows through to cash flow and we remain on track to deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2018.","The growth in cash flow has likewise flowed through to our distributions to shareholders and in early March, the board approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend. This marked the 13th straight year we have grown our dividend and we are pleased to be among a select group of REITs to have raised the dividend each and every year since our initial public offering in 2004.","Finally, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 5.3 times at the end of the first quarter and fixed charge coverage ticked up slightly to 4.3 times. Our cost and capital structure affords us the ability to self-fund over $1 billion of development spending in 2018 largely with cash flow from operations and an assist from the asset sales, Bill mentioned earlier.","As a result, we expect to maintain our target leverage and coverage levels throughout 2018 without the need for additional common equity as proceeds from asset sales are used to pay down debt, the full run rate benefit of DFT synergies are realized and our cash flows continue to grow as leases signed commenced throughout the year.","As you can see from the chart on page 13, our weighted average debt maturity is approximately five years and the weighted average coupon is approximately 3.4%. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and nearly, 100% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.","A little over 40% of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. We will continue to actively manage the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our asset.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 13, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm but also positioned to feel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe consistent with our long-term financing strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will be pleased to take your questions.","Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","My pleasure, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. First one just regarding the pace of leasing, I think this looks like one of the best quarters I can remember. And it comes on top of, as you pointed out, two pretty strong quarters, it happens to say lumpy but healthy on page 7. But this seems like leasing has gotten much more stable over the past few quarters. And so congrats on the execution, but I'm curious will we see increased volatility going forward and if so what is the bias, would it be upward volatility or downward?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, Jordan. You know we don't give bookings guidance and I sense from your question that you're trying to obtain bookings guidance. We're not going to change our policy. But as you might imagine, we're pleased with the trajectory over the past several quarters. You're correct, this is a record quarter. We've had great volume, also a very strong mix in products, logos and geographies. If you look back over the last 12 months, bookings have been trending up and that's how we obviously would like to keep it. We're confident in the growth of the business, long term growth of the business, so I would expect that quarterly volume will follow that as the current funnel is very healthy and we are confident that we can build on our recent momentum.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just moving on to the development pipeline which seems to be gaining some momentum as well, maybe you could speak to construction costs, you're quite a sizable developer in the scheme of things and construction costs appear to be rising as a function of increased demand, but also tariffs and skilled labor demands et cetera. How do you expect these rising construction costs to manifest themselves in the data center sector in your portfolio over the next couple of years, are rents going to come up a lot, because customers can bear the increases or will returns come down, what do you think?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Let me break that question apart. So first of all, I think that because of our designs, we've been doing an excellent job of taking costs out of the product, but I will say, I think it's going to be difficult to take much more cost out without affecting the residual value of the real estate. We have put in place something called our VMI program, which stands for vendor managed inventory. We have that in place for all of our major suppliers. And what that is, is a three-year contract where we've been able to lock in pricing for major items like generators, switchgear, UPS module. And importantly, we put that in place before the tariffs were put in place. So our pricing at least for the next three years won't be affected by rising steel prices.","I think the other factor that's important for everyone to keep in mind on the call is that we're the only data center company with an investment-grade balance sheet. And I think it's not just the cost of our debt, but the way Andy has managed the balance sheet that gives us a distinct competitive advantage in not only a rising rate environment but, currently, an environment that has an inverted yield curve. So most of our debt is fixed and it's been termed out for quite a period of time. We've also been able to de-risk the labor inflation that I think we will certainly see by keeping our contractors very busy and on site. It's another one of the benefits of having a global sales funnel and buying in bulk.","In terms of what's going to affect data center rents, we think that's most directly affected by supply. And if you think about the barriers to entry, it's a restriction in land, which we see certainly today in Silicon Valley and we think we're going to see it in Loudoun County in a few years. In some markets, you see a NIMBY sentiment, not in my backyard. We think that higher debt costs and build costs will also represent barriers to entry.","So while I don't think that, with the exception of Silicon Valley, you're necessarily going to see rent growth in the very near term. I think that you'll definitely see it over the intermediate term.","Operator","The next question will be from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So, a question about kind of the demand that you're seeing going forward, the scale demand. And is that basically upsized requirements by traditional scale customers or are you seeing a broadening of the types of customers, either by vertical or by region, that are interested in doing most of megawatt deals?","And then, following on to the last answer about the developments. The development pipeline, just given the volume and demand out there, do you feel that you're appropriately staffed or would you consider having a little bit more work-in-process to accommodate what seems to be kind of a rebound in demand back to sort of 2016 levels? Thanks.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Jeff, I'm going to take the first part of that question and I'll ask Andy to take the second part of it. The requirements \u2013 and I've said this on several calls, but the requirements have definitely grown larger over the last several years, but on top of that, and you mentioned in your question, the demand is also broader. It's more than just a handful of CSPs. And we're seeing it out of social media, we're seeing it out of global cloud, not just U.S.-based CSPs, we're seeing it out of the SaaS players and we're seeing it out of multinational hardware and software companies.","Maybe going back to Jordan's question though on the level of bookings. We do need at least one, what I would say, major anchor transaction every quarter to hit $50 million. If we have more than one, there will definitely be upside. If we don't hit that one, there will be downside. But I would say based on the volume that we see in our pipe, I'm confident that we'll get one. But nevertheless, it's still a lumpy business and that you see that with the 4-megawatt deal that that we announced that we signed in Amsterdam this month. But I can tell you that on balance, we're very encouraged by both the breadth and the depth of demand and we're looking forward to what the balance of this year has in store for us. Andy, why don't you take the second question of Jonathan's?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So your question related to appropriately stocking the development pipeline. It's obviously a very fine line as that we've seen from our competitors and we've experienced first-hand here at Digital in the history of our company. I would say we have a very robust capital planning function with a regular cadence, and we're doing our best to line up the supply and demand as the best we can. I think we do have some competitive advantages on many fronts. When you have a large installed customer base that is looking to grow in those markets with a preference to grow in adjacency to their existing loads, I think that translates into incremental wins that it's harder for a new competitor or a smaller provider to really attack.","If you look at our pipeline in total, it's almost 130 megs, north of 40% pre-leased. That's obviously book ended by some speculative development capacity and also fully pre-leased activity. If you just look at Northern Virginia, which is north of 60 megawatts and that's north of 60% pre-leased, I can tell you that remaining, call it, 23 megawatts, 24 megawatts that isn't preleased, we're almost playing Tetris with the customers in terms of lining their timelines to move in with our delivery schedules. So, we're definitely tiptoeing that fine line and I think we have the right balance for right now.","Operator","The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. One, with the DuPont integration largely behind you, I was curious about your appetite for M&A, particularly with some news out there that there could be some assets that are out there for sale, including some in, I guess, Brazil. And then secondly, your \u2013 what is it \u2013 your retention ratio was 58%, I believe, in your disclosures. That's below where it's typically been. I was wondering if you could just provide some color as to what's behind and then what your expectations going forward would be. Thank you.","Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Colby. Scott here. I'll take the first part of that question. Yes, we continue to look for other M&A opportunities. As you know, we're looking at everything that's out there or even not out there on the market. As always, we're focused on opportunities that have some strategic value to us, but as always, we are going to be good stewards of our shareholder capital and be disciplined as we pursue those opportunities.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Colby, just add to that, though. When you look at where the share prices are today and the multiples, they're obviously down from where they were a quarter or two. And that on the margin may make M&A less likely. And I think you couple that with where some of the recent trades occurred, which were at fairly lofty valuations. And I think that might argue that there would be less M&A near-term. Andy, do you want to pick up the second part of that question?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So I think you were pointing to the retention assuming just on the Scale TKF product, sub-60%. That was largely related to some churn. I think we'd called out a call a quarter or two ago in the Boston market an enterprise customer that was looking to consolidate some capacity. Now not all churn I would say is a bad thing. That provides an opportunity to take back space and re-productize that larger footprint into a colocation offering and expand our capabilities in the Boston market in particular.","By and large, other than the episodic customer moving from here and there, we do have some positive churn events where customer is just outgrowing a traditional colocation environment and wants to grow with us on a campus. So a customer moving from one part of their portfolio to another can actually be a positive event. And on the colo side, the other major product domain, we actually had, maybe not record, but very high retention, low churn this quarter call it north of 90% retention on those capacity.","Operator","The question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much. So you talked about the healthy pipeline a few times. Are you seeing any benefit from tax reform in terms of IM enterprise spending on expansion? Any more confidence there or is that something that you think might feather in later in the year? And on the hyper-scale side of it, is there any change in the mix between what they're self-performing, doing themselves versus what they are using you or others for in terms of outsourcing to build? Thanks.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey Simon, it's Dan Papes, thanks for the question. From the pipeline perspective, you're right. As we've termed it here in our discussion today, it's very healthy. We're really pleased with it. We're pleased with the second quarter, and as we take a look at the remainder of the year. We really can't trace any of it directly back to tax reform. It may be a small factor in there, but there is nothing obvious about the demand we're seeing from enterprise or the CSPs related to tax reform. We like to think it's just a great job being done by our sales team, but no really there's just no trace back to that that we see. I'll let Andy take the second question. Thanks, Simon.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. In terms of do-it-yourself versus seeking a professional provider like the Digital Realty, I think by and large we've seen more of a trend from even very highly sophisticated, well-capitalized technology customers to come to a Digital especially in the major markets where we have full product offering in terms of space power and also on the connectivity side and where we have land holdings to allow for their business to grow for years to come. I can just look at the mix of our largest signings across the portfolio that we had several signs this quarter that were in the 2 megawatt to 3 megawatt size, several in the 4 megawatt to 6 megawatt. I think 6 megawatt was the highest, in total 6.5 megawatt. And it was from a smattering of customers, different customers, U.S. multinationals, top five cloud service providers, other large sophisticated enterprises that could have the ability to build their own data center and they've come to us for our capabilities in the global platform we deliver to them.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Couple things if I could. One is, if you go back to, I think it was slide 4 in the deck. You shaded the core-plus range of 9% to 12% for developing yield. And I'm curious how that fits into the current year guidance for developing yields of 10% to 12%? And what does this say about the future direction of the aggregate development yields for the Digital portfolio?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. This is Andy. I think the genesis of this chart was really to try to provide an illustrative view as to incremental risk takes on incremental reward and not an effort to change our guidance table, which we reiterated on the 10% to 12% for unlevered cash returns on our $1 billion of development spend. I think we obviously tilt towards the 10% when projects are de-risked. De-risk can happen from significant amount of pre-leasing or activity, and we tilt towards the higher end of that range when there's more risk in the equation.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to clarify just a lot of questions on the bookings. But, Bill, you mentioned feeling comfortable hitting the $15 million range assuming you get at least one anchor tenant, it sounds like 6.5% was the biggest for this quarter. So I mean is that what you mean when you're referring to an anchor tenant, something in that 5 megawatt or 6 megawatt deal size? And then second question is more on the dispositions. I know they're non-core, so maybe not a great read through for the rest of the value of the portfolio. But just curious if you could give some commentary on the California data centers that were 100% leased that traded at pretty high cap rate?","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. I mean we take a look on that deal that you mentioned, the $6 million deal, keep in mind that there was shell associated with that which will likely lead to some additional improved data center space that will be leased over time. But, yes, that's fair. Andy, you want to handle the asset sale question?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Actually, Scott, do you want to hit the dispose?","Scott E. Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. I can nail that. Those assets were out in the, call it, the Sacramento market which is a non-core market, so not as robust a demand from the potential investors or buyers out there. Also one of those assets was a little challenged with some structural vacancy there which kind of led towards that higher yield on that.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And, Vin, I think in summary, it's a continuation of the capital recycling program that really under Bill in Scott's leadership started years back to kind of exit markets, exit non-core assets and redeploy that capital at better returns into the core portfolio.","Operator","The next question will come from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So just curious on Europe, obviously the industry is seeing some strong growth there. Any thoughts on why not spending some capital and trying to be more aggressive in that market? How should we think about that going forward?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, thanks, Frank. This is Andy. I can take that one. So I think we're doing a very good job at executing in Europe and timing is everything because the example we mentioned on the call, a very sizable customer landed in Amsterdam with us in our Scale campus. It was a legacy DFT relationship we were able to grow internationally and we thought it was going to land during the quarter and it popped over into the next month. And on the backs, I think though there's been a tremendous amount of activity in a few other markets outside of Amsterdam. In Frankfurt, where we've delivered our first campus offering 6 megawatts. We're moving well along in terms of landing an anchor customer with the top-five global service provider.","And turning to London, I know the team is working on a, call it, a 600 kilowatt or so deal on the enterprise vertical as well as some demand coming out of our Asia Pacific sales team looking to land in the London market. So the timing of our inventory coming online seem to be quite fortuitous in terms of an increase in demand backdrop. And we think we have the right capacity, and if this continues, like we've seen in the very end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, I think that would point to continue to put investment into Europe.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, I just wanted to follow-up on the SG&A line. It really dropped dramatically quarter-to-quarter. How much is this just seasonal? Is this the new base level? And is it going to rebound through the year or is there something else going on there? And then I have one follow-up?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Richard. Thanks for that question. The answer to your question is yes and yes. It did step down partly due to seasonal in terms of bonus accruals. As we know our numbers and performance close to the end of the year. That number will ratchet up a little bit in the third and fourth quarters, and you can kind of look at that similar trend in past third and fourth quarters.","We also were carrying in the G&A some head count and some non-comp expense associated with our DFT acquisition that has been winding down on both of those fronts. And we do think, it will step back up, as some of our G&A investments, be it our IT systems, our investment in the sales and marketing department, sales engineering and our overall IT department, as we work on finalizing our integrations and invest the team, similar to the comments we made at our Investor Day in the beginning of December, really to spend not massive dollars but amount in the budget to fuel growth in the business. So I do think they'll pick up in the back half of the year.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then looking at the supplemental, it seems like on the lease expiration things were pushed out. It might be a subtle difference, but just wanted to be able to ask about it. Have you been working to kind of extend out customers and it maybe is not something that you can just point out on a big level, but it seems like a lot of the 2018 and 2019 expirations have been pushed out. Is there something there that we should be aware of?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I would say we're always looking to push out customer contracts and having customers contracting with us for longer terms at fair and rising rates. So we did about $57 million of renewals. I don't think that was a record renewal quantity for us. The weighted average renewal term on the TKF which is the larger dollar longer term stuff, let's call it five years. And, no, we obviously keep chopping through our renewals every year. I think we're taking a very much a holistic approach with our global customer base and using those installed, embedded relationships and contracts to come to mutually beneficial outcomes and package more business together and use that installed customer base as a competitive advantage that helps our customers more than some of our competitors can.","Operator","The next question will be from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. I noticed the base building construction pipeline increased by a fair amount this quarter. Can you provide some color on that?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","My gut, Lukas, is \u2013 that's on the developments-type pipeline that's really largely driven by some of the activity in Northern Virginia. And like I said, we've got, call it 23 megawatts that are as of the quarter were unleased and we're working fast and furiously and bringing on incremental shelves because we'll be quickly through building out on that campus, at least the first phase of it. We also \u2013 something I should mention. We also had in the prior quarter there was a shell that was not there that we brought online because the customer signed a lease for the entirety of a shell like in 36 megawatts, including initial take of 6 megawatts within it as well on a long-term basis. So that kind of speaks to the activity in that market, in particular that customers are in large amounts moving to fully contracts when we're literally looking at dirt and explain design very quickly.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors LLC","That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. The straight line rent line item, looks like it's up a little bit over the last couple of quarters. And is that just driven by free rent on recent lease signings or what's kind of driving that line item?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I think there was something in the prior quarter that deflated that adjustment. It was episodic maybe on the leasehold side. I would say with signing more longer-term deals with escalators is going to certainly continue to widen that gap between your GAAP rent and your cash rent. So that would probably be another attributor to the widening of that number. But relatively I would say fairly small adjustment because I would say that the delta between our FFO and AFFO is relatively narrow speaking to the quality of our earnings.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Gutman of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Gutman - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, we haven't seen much power-based building for quite a while, and it turned up again this quarter. I was wondering, especially based on the comment you made, I think, answering the last question, does this indicate anything about the customer view? Why is this suddenly coming back into the picture? Is it a positive read on demand? And similarly, in Asia Pacific, you had significant Turn-Key leasing. I was wondering if you could provide some greater color on location and the context for that.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Rob. Thanks for the question. So, I do think the data point you pointed out does point to a trend we're seeing in the business as these large either top five cloud service providers, other hyperscalers are seeing a long-term growth trend in their business. And they're looking to lock up capacity in large quantities, knowing that they'll grow into it over time.","In that example, they took down the entire shell and rented that from us \u2013 or upon delivery, they will rent it from us, and then took one suite and then will grow into that suite \u2013 the full shell over time. I think that's something not necessarily identical structures, but I think that many of our large and growing customers are thinking long-term about the growth in their business. And this is just one way to tackle it.","Turning to Asia, I would say, I just spent some time over there with our team over there who's incredibly talented and had some great success with the local customer base. And really, it's been about a bit of an import\/export business and I don't say that in jest, but it's bringing those local customers into the data centers in Singapore where we had significant pick up in leasing with the new logo on a large-scale deal. And it's also setting that same demand to other parts of the Digital Realty portfolio. And I'm thinking particularly of some of the Chinese customers where they've sent that demand into North America on both coasts and also tracking deals, as I mentioned earlier, in the European market with that same profile of customer.","So, overall, great progress from the team in Asia-Pacific in the last handful of quarters, actually.","Operator","The next question will come from Nick Del Deo of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I was hoping to drill down a bit further into rent changes that you're seeing at renewal. More specifically, if we slice your Turn-Key portfolio different ways, like older facilities versus newer facilities or Internet gateways versus corporate facilities or higher resiliency versus lower resiliency, are there differences in what you see at renewal or would you characterize them as fairly similar across the board? And then second, I was just hoping you give us an update on some of the customer service initiatives you're undertaking and if you're starting to see any benefit in the result?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Nick, I'll tackle the first one, and I'll toss it out to team to talk about on the customer service side. We have a table in the back of our financial supp, it's either page 20 or 21 or 22, that really breaks out the product offerings. I would say the outcome of our expirations in terms of cash mark-to-market is driven by the product offering. It's driven by the customer profile. And as you can see on that, the bulk of our Internet gateways, as you've mentioned, fall within our colocation footprint. And that's not exclusively, but you see that we had 3.5% cash mark-to-markets, all with 90% retention.","And if you move to the Turn-Key Flex, which is typically a little bit larger scale, definitely approaching the multiple megawatts in terms of expirations and renewals, that was closer to 4%. It's those colocation product offerings, those Internet gateways are typically incredibly network customer dense, limited capacity, maybe the most challenging type of capacity to move to a new provider. But both, by and large, have had kind of cycled through some peak vintage leases and turned into positive in the last couple of quarters.","The other thing I want to touch on real quickly is, we really try to take a holistic customer approach, agnostic to product, and try to bring as many pieces of business, be it a network node in an Internet gateway, a scale renewal in one of our campuses, business in North America or Asia or Europe, and bring that in a holistic fashion to the customer and bring more to the table than just a transactional experience, which we think is a win for the customer in terms of delivering more value, and we think it's a win for Digital. And that often how we treat that customer at the renewal and those economic equations may flow through with a little bit softer or positive cash mark-to-market, but may also translate into more signings in the portfolio near-term and in the future.","Maybe I'll turn it over to Dan to talk a little bit about the customer service initiative.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Thanks, Nick, for the question. We look at our performance over the last few quarters and our confidence in the pipeline right now. I think your question on customer services is quite valid to ask because we feel like it's making a significant difference in the demand pipeline that we're seeing from our customers. We have customer success managers deployed across our client base. We've invested in that role inside the company so that we stay close to our existing customers, while the sales team is out building new pipeline and we have very, very positive feedback from our customers in regard to that. We mentioned previously our Digital Delivers Program, which basically when a customer has feedback for us they just click a hyperlink at the bottom of any of our emails and get a response in 24 hours, and very positive feedback on that.","We've talked about the focus on cultural changes and customer centricity in the company. That's making a big difference for us as well. And then, finally to say again, the executive sponsor program where all of us are getting out into the field and spending time with our clients, understanding what their strategic and tactical needs are, makes us really well informed leadership team and able to much more effectively make decisions that end up in, we believe, much happier customers and repeat customers. That's working well for us.","Operator","And the next question will come from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. Could you give us more color on why interconnection grew around 7% 1Q 2018? And just in the context of just your performance in the quarter, can you give us a little more color on that? And also after that, a second part to that is, could you give us more color on the work you're doing with Megaport, considering you actually invested another $5 million in a follow-on equity offering? And I could go from there.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Sami. Maybe I'll just touch on the interconnection revenue on the signings and the full tour on the P&L and then I'll toss over to Chris Sharp, our CTO to add on to that and also give some commentary on the Megaport question you had. So it was a little bit lower \u2013 on the signings front obviously a step-up versus the prior quarter but still not at a level that we're completely satisfied with. I can't tell you, I'd pointed to something specific episodic on the signings. I often look at it the interconnection signings kind of hand-in-hand with the colocation signings where the bulk of that connectivity is being serviced.","And on a quarter-over-quarter basis, while not at peak number were down, call it, just north of 10%. I attribute that largely to our pipeline and execution around some larger colocation deals. So sub megawatt, I call it 200 kilowatts, 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, 500 kilowatts.","And another dynamic going on there is some \u2013 the lines are blurring a little bit between our products in terms of colocation and scale and some of those type deals have actually fallen outside of the colo product into a scale TKF suite. We actually saw a tick up, close to 14% or about 0.5 megawatt for sub 600 kilowatt deals that landed outside of colo.","A prime example of that was a large telecommunication company that landed with us I think in nine locations and about half were in product types colo and half were outside product types colo. But net-net I think it's good news because our breadth of product allows us to capture that and I think the pipeline for some of the larger colo deals, which should have additional connectivity in the ensuing quarters is looking pretty strong. But maybe I'll open it up to Chris to add on to that or touch on the Megaport question as well.","Chris Sharp - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. And Sami, yeah, you're are absolutely correct. We're very happy with the partnership that we have in place with Megaport today. It's a very unique partnership out in the market. One of the things that we always emphasize is that the core component to our overall service exchange which some of the key highlights are on the service exchange is, it's really changing the dialogue that we're having with customers today and allowing us to really remove a lot of complexity from their deployments and allowing them to stand up their hybrid cloud architectures and one customer in point after \u2013 in most recently win in this last quarter is Netgain. They are a cloud IT provider delivering cloud hosting and managed services for healthcare and financial vertical.","It's really the service exchange is allowing them to provide a much more dynamic environment for their customers in accessing the Microsoft Azure cloud. And then lastly, I mean, one of the reasons that Netgain came to Digital is the fact that they're able to provide a more robust, very performance aware deployment and be able to access a set of future cloud services which allows them to really broaden their horizons and leverage a future set of cloud services across that exchange. And that's where, one of the reasons why we picked Megaport to partner with is that not only their work, but our conjoined working going to market allows us to really solve a very differentiated part of the market and the fact that we've been able to accelerate the launch of the service exchange into most recently Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London due to the customer demand because of the fact that we have all the top five cloud providers on that platform. So, that's including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, Oracle and IBM.","So it's really allowing us to have a value based dialogue with our customer base. So we're very happy with the partnership we have in place with Megaport and we look to continue to expand the service exchange functionality across our portfolio.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.","A. William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we continue to execute on the integration of DuPont Fabros capitalizing on the value of the installed customer base to realize revenue synergies reaching record high bookings and backlog. We also delivered very solid current financial results being in consensus and raising guidance. Three of the sustainable growth in our earnings has flowed through to cash flow, as well as our distributions to shareholders. And our board recently approved a 9% increase in the per share dividend making this the 13th straight year that we've given shareholders a raise on the dividend.","We achieved this growth in our distributions to shareholders while preserving our best-in-class balance sheet which we believe is a critical differentiator, particularly in a rising rate environment. Last but not least our board has approved a resolution giving shareholders the right to propose binding amendments to our bylaws. As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution.","Thank you all for joining us and we hope to see many of you at NAREIT in June.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Please go ahead.","John Stewart","Thank you, Sean. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein; CFO, Andy Power; and Interxion CEO, David Ruberg. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright; and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.","This call will contain non-GAAP financial information.

In July, we announced we were reentering Paris, expanding in Frankfurt, entering Seoul, and opening four new facilities in Brazil.","In September, we announced we are acquiring land in Tokyo and we also announced a $1.4 billion private capital initiative with Mapletree, bringing our year-to-date private capital raising to over $2 billion, including the joint venture with Brookfield we closed in the first quarter.","In October, we raised $900 million of long-term capital at all-time low coupons and reached renewable energy agreements in Northern Virginia and Oregon, where we signed an anchor lease to break ground on land inherited through the DFT acquisition.","Earlier this morning, the Adani Group announced that we have exceeded a memorandum of understanding to establish a joint venture in India. And last, but certainly not least, this afternoon, we made the very exciting announcement that we have entered into a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 15 years ago to the day, Digital listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are thrilled to be celebrating our 15-year anniversary as a public company with a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion in a highly strategic and complementary transaction that will create a leading global provider of cloud and carrier-neutral data center solutions with an enhanced presence in high-growth major European metro areas.","As you can see on Page 2 of our presentation, we believe the best way to serve our customer needs is by offering a comprehensive set of data center solutions and covering the full product spectrum, from small footprint cage and cabinet environments, all the way up to multi-megawatt dedicated hyperscale facilities on a truly global basis from Sydney to Singapore to Santiago to Santa Clara.","Customers form the bedrock of our strategy. And in order to meet their needs around the world, we have invested and partnered with a series of leading local brands. In the Americas, we have partnered with Brookfield to serve our customers through Ascenty, the leading data center provider in Brazil with a community of platform compute and network notes that mock connected via a proprietary fiber network.","In APAC, we teamed up with Mitsubishi Corporation to launch MC Digital Realty in Japan, where we have recent announced a pair of land parcel purchases in Tokyo to support growing customer demand.","And, of course, earlier this afternoon, we reached a definitive agreement to combine with Interxion, a leading provider of carrier and cloud natural colocation data center services in EMEA. We believe the combination will deliver compelling benefits for customers, shareholders, and employees.","I'm pleased to welcome Interxion CEO, David Ruberg and I'd like to turn the call over to him to share his perspective and discuss the strategic merits of the transaction.","David Ruberg","Thank you, Bill. I'm excited to be here today to talk about the opportunity to join forces with Digital.","Please turn to slide 3. As Bill mentioned, we strongly believe that this combination is highly strategic as well as complementary. Like everything we do, the strategic rationale starts with our customers.","For many years, Interxion has been creating communities of interest in our data centers that offer carriers, Digital platform providers and enterprises access to high levels of connectivity and performance with participation in communities that can enhance the value proposition to their customers. This approach has been very successful across EMEA, and we see tremendous opportunity to replicate and extend this model across Digital's current and growing footprint.","Interxion's connectivity capabilities are a primary source of our competitive advantage, highly connected locations on a logical destinations for content providers and cloud platform providers, who are seeking to provide services to these content providers. Not only do cloud platforms deploy network nodes in these locations, but there is a growing awareness on their part of the value of deploying compute, especially in close proximity to these network nodes.","Workload placement close to the end user is equally critical for data intensive, next-generation cloud native applications that are focused on real-time data analytics, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.","The combination of Interxion's connectivity capabilities with Digital's hyperscale and enterprise expertise put the combined company in a unique position to take advantage and capitalize on the emerging global digitalization trends and to offer our customers an efficient and cost-effective way to address their requirements.","I'd like to spend a moment on this structure and the leadership of the combined organization. This transaction is being structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital share per Interxion share. Interxion shareholders will own approximately 20% of the combined company, and Digital shareholders will own the remaining approximately 80%. Both boards have unanimously approved this transaction, and I have irrevocably agreed to tender my shares.","Bill Stein will be the CEO of the combined organization, and I will be the CEO of our combined EMEA businesses, which upon closing would be branded Interxion, a Digital company. I will work with Bill and our teams to integrate the two businesses. And over the next year or so, I plan to transition from the day-to-day management of the EMEA business to focusing on the combined company's development of communities of interest across our global footprint and working with some of our core global accounts.","While the rationale for this transaction is about customers, the execution will be about employees. The success of the combined organization will depend upon our employees, and I intend to spend a lot of time working to ensure that our employees understand and contribute to our efforts to build these leading global platforms. And I want to assure our teams the process of transitioning from two separate entities into a combined global organization will be fair, consistent, transparent, recognizing the importance of preserving the rich culture and country diversity within the combined businesses. We also expect the combination will produce enhanced career opportunities for employees as the combined companies' growth accelerates.","I also note that both companies have sizable development pipelines, which represent significant embedded growth potential and provide considerable runway to support our customers' growth, given our strategic land holdings along with Digital's hyperscale development expertise and highly efficient funding model.","Finally, we believe our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders will benefit from Digital's investment grade balance sheet and lower cost of capital.","In closing, I am personally very excited about the opportunity this represents for all of our stakeholders. I'm convinced that combined, Digital and Interxion will be able to build the leading global platform that can help shape and deliver what our growing universe of customers require. I look forward to working closely with Bill and the entire Digital team to complete the transaction, integrate the businesses and to build the world's premier data center provider.","And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill.","Bill Stein","Thank you, David. Let's pick back up on the transaction structure here on Page 4. As David indicated, the transaction is structured as a stock-for-stock combination, and Interxion shareholders would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.7067 Digital Realty shares per Interxion share, which represents roughly a 20% premium to the unaffected share price as of October 9.","The transaction is subject to approval by both sets of shareholders, and we expect to close the transaction sometime next year. The breakup fee represents 1% of Interxion's market cap, and the agreement is subject to a 7% overbid color with matching rights.","As David alluded to, we are very cognizant of the value of the Interxion platform, and this deal is not about expense synergies. Nonetheless, we do see some opportunity for cost savings, primarily redundant public company costs and interest savings on refinancing Interxion's higher cost debt at Digital Realty's lower borrowing cost in the European debt capital markets. We expect to achieve up to $20 million of annualized synergies, and we expect to realize roughly three quarters of our target in 2021 with the full run rate realized in 2022.","Assuming a second quarter close, given the time line for realizing synergies, we expect the transaction will be approximately 1% to 2% dilutive in 2020 and a bit better than breakeven in 2021 and significantly accretive to the combined companies' long-term growth profile.","Let's set the stage by framing the opportunity in Europe on Page 5. While GDP levels in Europe and North America are about the same and the population of Europe is significantly larger, the total outsourced data center capacity in Europe today is much smaller.","The rapid expansion of cloud and content platforms is driving significant data center demand across Europe. However, within the platform segment, there are significant differences in terms of maturity of adoption across Europe. Even the most technology-centric European countries are 18 to 24 months behind the U.S., followed by a varying degree of maturity across the European continent.","This concept is visually depicted on the right-hand side of the slide, which describes directionally how we see the rollout unfolding without intending to provide accurate predictions on the relative size or timing of each opportunity. The cumulative effect of this gradual rollout portrays the significant opportunity ahead of us here in Europe.","Let's turn to the standalone Interxion profile on Page 6. As you may know, Interxion's business consist of 53 high-quality carrier and cloud neutral colocation facilities in 13 high-growth metros across 11 countries in Europe and an investment in Africa. They have over 200 megawatts of equipped capacity serving more than 2,000 customers with platforms representing approximately 40% of recurring revenue and the balance put evenly between connectivity and enterprise.","Flipping over to Page 7. You will see that our combined EMEA business will service an expanded customer base for more than 90 facilities in 15 metros across 11 countries in Europe. As you can see from the pie charts, the bottom of the slide, not only does the combination create a broader network for landing and expanding customers, but our businesses are highly complementary.","Digital's position in London and Dublin dovetails nicely with Interxion's presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris and across the rest of Europe. The pro forma business mix covers the continent and is well balanced between the major European metros.","Turning now to Page 8. Interxion has successfully executed a strategy in creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe, and an internet gateway in Marseille serves as the digital media hub to 4.5 billion eyeballs across EMEA, as a prime example. We see significant opportunities to extend Interxion's capabilities to identify and develop high-value communities of interest across the combined company's global footprint.","As shown on page 9, our customer accounts are similar despite the difference in the size of our businesses, which gives you some appreciation for the density of the communities of interest the Interxion team has successfully created. These communities match up well with the hyperscale compute engine's Digital Realty as successfully landed across our global platform. The combination of our respective strengths should enhance our ability to solve the public and hybrid cloud architectural acquirements of our global customer base.","Interxion's developing pipeline represents a source of significant potential embedded growth as shown on page 10. In addition to the 53 facilities currently in service, Interxion also has 500 constructions. These projects are significantly preleased and represent a substantial expansion of the installed base, including land owned or controlled Interxion has the potential to double the size of its existing business.","The transaction will also create significant financial benefits as shown on page 11. The combined company will have a global presence in 44 metros across 20 countries on 6 continents with an enterprise value of approximately $50 billion, nearly five times the size of the next largest competitor. We expect the combined organization will have the most efficient cost structure and the highest EBITDA margin in the data center sector.","Finally, let's talk about capital structure on page 12. The combined company will have an equity market cap of over $35 billion and a total enterprise value of more than $50 billion. The balance sheet's impact will be leveraged neutral, but one of the key benefits of the transaction is the opportunity for Interxion stakeholders to benefit from Digital Realty's lower borrowing costs and improved ability to fund the growth of the business as well as the continued growth of the per share dividend, which we have raised each and every year since our IPO in 2004.","In summary, this combination is highly strategic and complementary. It is prudently financed with a stock-for-stock structure and is expected to be accretive to the long-term growth trajectory of the combined organization. We are excited to deliver this compelling opportunity that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for customers, shareholders and employees of both companies.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andy Power","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 14. We delivered solid leasing volume with balance performance across sectors, products and geographies. We signed total bookings of $69 million, just shy of our all-time second best. Third quarter bookings included an $8 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $51 million with a weighted average lease term of a little over 7 years, including a $7.4 million co-location contribution. We added another all-time high 64 new logos during the third quarter, led by global strength in our enterprise segment.","We quietly leased 14 megawatts in Ashburn during the third quarter, and our biggest deal in this market was just 6 megawatts. Although Northern Virginia has been notoriously competitive this year, we view the current supply\/demand dislocation as a temporary phenomenon. Particularly in light of Amazon's selection of Crystal City for its H Q2 and Microsoft's selection for the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI contract, we are bullish on the long-term prospects for communications infrastructure in the Commonwealth as well as our position in the market given the value of our strategic land holdings, our ability to support our customer needs today and to provide the longest runway for their growth.","In terms of specific wins during the quarter, we partnered with AT&T to devise a solution for a global biotech firm to service their edge network and data center partner for global edge deployments across multiple North America locations, London and Frankfurt, placing the customer in close proximity to their end user customers, improving application performance and consolidating and reducing their network costs. The customer selected AT&T and Digital Realty to deploy their next-generation IT hubs based upon our collective global footprints, proximity to their locations, access to a wide array of network providers, and the ability to interconnect to multiple public clouds, leveraging digital service exchange fabric.","One of the nation's most comprehensive integrated academic healthcare delivery systems expanded their commitment to our global platform this quarter. This new expansion has a dual purpose that will serve to consolidate a number of their smaller data centers and serve our closets from their metro regional units, including on-premise facilities.","In addition, the lack of a disaster recovery and business continuity site for their production data center puts Digital Realty in another location. We provide a solution with service exchange, which help them access Azure and our SD-WAN platform and dark fiber network between our campuses, enabling them to execute a key part of their hybrid IT strategy.","We are also seeing traction in EMEA and APAC based customers joining our global platform. One example this quarter is a European big data and analytics company wanting to expand its operations to North America. Our global platform capabilities were uniquely suited to meet their high performance computing and rapid expansion requirements.","Turning to our backlog on page 16. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced, stepped down from $127 million as of June 30th to $98 million at the end of the third quarter due to several large commencements in Northern Virginia, Toronto and Silicon Valley. During the third quarter, the lag between signings and commencement was slightly below our long-term historical average in a little less than five months.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 17. We signed $152 million of renewals during the third quarter, in addition to new leases signed. As you may recall, 2019 was our all-time high in terms of lease expirations, and our four highest renewal quarters have all come within the last 12 months, including a new all-time high for quarterly renewal leasing volume this quarter.","Year-to-date, we retained almost 85% of expiring leases, a bit better than our long-term trend. The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the third quarter was nearly nine years, while cash rents on renewals rose up 7.2%.","In addition to the legacy DLR long-term top customer renewals we secured earlier this year, we finally executed the long-awaited legacy DFT customer renewal during the third quarter, and we did better than expected rate but shorter on term.","As you may have seen, we raised our guidance for cash re-leasing spreads again from down mid-single digits to slightly negative, reflecting the better than expected outcome. Aside from a few select supply constrained regions and metro areas, we've yet to see broad-based rental rate growth across most markets.","However, we are continuing to make significant progress sliding through peak vintage renewals. The lion share of our portfolio has recently been leased at current market rents, and we are beginning to see barriers to entry emerged in a growing number of markets around the world. As a result, we expect to see continued gradual improvement on cash re-leasing spreads into 2020 and beyond.","In terms of third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 87.4%, entirely due to reclassification of the fully leased Mapletree facilities as held for sale at quarter end.","Same capital cash NOI was down 3.7%, in line with our guidance and reflected a 70 basis point FX headwind, higher property tax accruals and the restructuring of the private colocation reseller customer earlier this year.","The U.S. dollar continue to climb relative to prior year exchange rates, and FX represented roughly a 75 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 18.","Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 19. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing.","Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt, a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have less than a 50 basis point impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed, and our capital plan is fully funded.","In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 2.4% year-over-year or 3.3% on a constant currency basis. As you can see from the bridge chart on page 20, we do expect the quarterly run rate to get dip down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the Mapletree joint venture transaction, which we expect to close in early November. As a result, we are revising our 2019 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the dilution from the joint venture transaction as well as the two opportunistic long-term capital raises in October that were not previously contemplated in our guidance.","As you begin to roll your model forward to the fourth quarter and beyond to next year, there are several puts and takes to keep in mind. We expect to close the Mapletree joint venture transaction in early November and the Mapletree portfolio sale in early January. Consequently, we expect a partial period of dilution in the fourth quarter and a full year in 2020. The interest income on the Ascenty bridge loan and the U.K. income tax benefit in 1Q '19 were both onetime benefits in the current year and are not expected to recur in 2020.","We've extended the duration of the forward equity settlement which does provide a current year benefit to per share earnings and cash flow but do expect to eventually settle the forward equity offering early next year, which will likewise represent a drag to year-over-year growth in per share earnings and cash flow in 2020. Conversely, knock on wood; we are not currently anticipating any changes in accounting policy in 2020 unlike the impact on the reported results from the change in lease accounting in 2019 and revenue recognition in 2018.","Last, but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 21. Net debt-to-EBITDA stood at 6.1 times as of the end of the third quarter, while fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.3 time for the Mapletree transaction and settlement of the forward equity offering, net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line with our targeted range at approximately five times while fixed charge coverage is just under 4.5 times.","In terms of capital-raising activity, in mid-September, we announced a $1.4 billion portfolio sale and joint venture transaction with Mapletree, a leading Singaporean real estate investment firm. These transactions represent an important step towards our goal of self-funding our growth and diversifying our sources of equity capital and setting the stage for accelerating growth as the proceeds are redeployed into accretive investment opportunities. We expect to close the joint venture in early November and the portfolio sale in early January. Likewise, in mid-September, we extended duration of our forward equity offering by 12 months to most efficiently match the timing of our sources and uses given the $1.4 billion of pending proceeds from the Mapletree transactions.","In early October, we raised $345 million of perpetual preferred equity and 5.2% in all-time low preferred equity coupon for Digital Realty. The very next day, we opportunistically tapped that Eurobond market, raising approximately $550 million of 8.5-year paper and one in an eighth like wise an all-time low coupon. This successful execution against our financing strategy is a reflection of the strength of our global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital; sets us apart from our peers; and enables us to prudently fund our growth.","As you can see from the chart on page 22, our weighted average debt maturities is over six years, and we weighted our weighted average coupon down another 10 basis points this quarter to 3.2%.","Half of our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investment outside the U.S. Over 80% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment. And 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 22, we have a clear runway with virtually no near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Sean, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler","Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the transaction. My first question is regarding the initial dilution and the ultimate accretion surrounding the transaction. Is the assumption for 2020 that initial dilution factoring in the transaction on a leverage neutral basis or as is? And then, maybe you can speak to beyond the immediate term dilution, ultimately, how we should sort of quantify what you think the accretion will look like on a growth perspective to the overall platform.","Andy Power","Thanks, Jordan. This is Andy. So we will maybe go to your question on the balance sheet first. This is 100% stock-for-stock transaction. And when you look at the capital structure slide on our investor deck, you can see its leverage neutral, including the friction from any transaction cost. So in a pro forma for our Mapletree and equity forward, we'll rate it right, our 5 times net debt-to-EBITDA target ratio and still have the proceed from those capital to kind of fund the combined companies' growth, which we're really excited about.","2020 is obviously a little bit tough to handicap here, as we're kind of thing at the very end of 2019. We both have to go get shareholder approval for this transaction and also get any regulatory approval. So depending on where you handicap on closing, anywhere, call it, at the end of 1Q or the end of 2Q or so, you have a fraction of the year.","We also really do not assume any synergies pull through with combined business in 2020. Maybe that's a tad bit conservative. So happier or less, just a little over half here combined, no synergies. That's kind of how we get to that roughly 1% to 2% dilution per share in 2020.","But in 2021, when you look at the combined company, we described this as a bit better than breakeven, so we did describe it as accretive. Obviously, a combination of the relative valuation from the exchange of our shares. We do have a pickup from refinancing their non-investor grade debt with our investor grade euro bonds to pick a couple hundred basis points of savings there.","And then, we do see some of the synergy starting flow through in 2021 to just get a little over breakeven. And then, we see pretty solid accretion from 2022 there on out. And, I guess, to reiterate what you said, we also see accretion to the growth profile of the combined company. As you can see, we have a very complementary long term under construction and landholdings in the European market to continue to fuel that growth.","Jordan Sadler","Is there a way to quantify that growth profile accretion? You said significantly accretive to the combined company's gross profile, I believe, in the prepared remarks. I'm just, is it 100 basis points better growth in the three to five year period? 200 basis points?","Andy Power","I think on a per share basis, when we kind of flip into 2022 and beyond, I think you reverse the dilution estimate we estimated in 2020. So call it 1% to 2% accretive to our FFO or FFO per share.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin with RBC. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes. I had a couple of questions about the deal and then a follow-up about just kind of market trends. But as you look at regulatory approval in Europe, CyrusOne and Zenium took a couple of quarters longer than initially anticipated. And then Equinix, Telecity, of course, ended up acquiring divestitures.","So I'm interested in kind of your expectations around time line and your thoughts about what some of the aspects to consider would be around the country level and EU approval on the deal. And then just as a footnote, maybe to Jordan's question, I just wanted to be sure, but the $20 million of synergy that you identified, is that entirely OpEx or not? I just missed that.","And then I guess, just the second question would be around market review, which metros \u2013 Andy talked about this in the script a little bit, but just interested in which metros currently in North America, Europe and APAC are showing the most kind of hyperscale demand? Thank you.","Greg Wright","Hey, Jonathan, it's Greg Wright. Let me take the first question, with respect to antitrust. Look, I think in working with both lawyers on each side of the transaction, we take a look at their geographic overlap and the like. I think we feel good about our outcome on any anti-trust issues.","In terms of time, it's always hard to say timing. But I think factoring in that, that's why Andy gave you a range from end of first quarter to end of second quarter that would be the long-term debt if you will, for any timing differences. So I would say that's factored into the guidance that Andy just gave. But again, when we look at it, again, both sets of lawyers and other professionals on the antitrust front, we feel good.","Andy Power","Hey, Jon, just to add on to perspective then I'll try to round out your other questions. This is Andy. Obviously, I think what you got to hear is a tremendous value proposition for customers, when were bringing together a European portfolio that was very strong in the United Kingdom, in London, and the InterXion team having done fantastic job on Mainland Europe. So, complementary in terms of product and footprint. So I think that will also help sort of our cards when going through regulatory process.","On the expenses synergies, I just \u2013 I would characterize expense energies, not OpEx overheads specific type of expense synergies. There is obviously some public \u2013 redundant public company cost here, including our Board of Directors, that are \u2013 it's kind of easier low-hanging fruit to go out first. I do think there's also going to be revenue synergies here that we don't really have factored into our numbers or, our combined customer base are now going to be able to that were able to be the trusted global partner for this combined customer base around the globe across six continents and 20 countries. So do invest in another key element of this transaction. And then last but not least, I think your assessment overall kind of how the quarter went in terms of markets demand. I'll try to go real quickly on that.","On the digital side starting with Europe, we had the, I guess, the topping off, or like the \u2013 we have the last kilowatts into our Frankfurt 27-megawatt campus with a top cloud service provider. We had a smaller win with an enterprise customer into the London market. I think those were the highlights there.","Over in Asia Pacific, we had another top CSP land in our soccer campus with a fairly large signing down South America. And Brazil, we had continued growth from a top 5 CSP. And North America had a little bit of the same as early in the year, a little bit of different. We had continued success in Toronto with two different top CSPs with strength in the financial services sector in our Northern New Jersey, New York metro area growth from existing customer on our Dallas campus. And in Northern Virginia Ashburn in fact, actually did come back. We had some great wins there, some of which we highlighted in the script: two international wins, one coming out of issue Pacific, one coming out of Europe that landed in Nova, and then also a large legacy digital customer taking down several megawatts as well. So, I would say those are kind of tops the waves in terms of demand for the quarter on our side.","Jonathan Atkin","Thank you. If I could just follow-up briefly the leverage neutral \u2013 the all-stock deal and the implications for leverage. It sounds like it gives you some dry powder for further expansion. You announced Korea earlier this year, and then India in the last 24 hours. But how do we think about your expansion pipeline in some of these Asian markets versus elsewhere. And for David perhaps, what led you from the InterXion side to kind of favor the all-stock structure versus maybe a mix of cash and stock?","Bill Stein","Hey, Jon, this is a Bill. In terms of the Asian market expansion, you mentioned India in particular. India, at this point, is exploratory. It's a 6-month MOU as we\u2019re exclusive to each other, but we have made no commitments in terms of capital. So it's really tough to bracket the amount of capital that's going to be required for that venture.","Other than that, I would expect that our capital program will continue as it has been, its a billion dollars plus a year. And we have broke through all-equity nature of this transaction as well as additional asset sales that are contemplated. I would expect that we are self-funded easily through next year on development.","Andy Power","And John \u2013 John Stewarts' waving at me, I think we have given you 4 or 5 questions, so we have to get you back in the queue to round out that last question.","A \u2013 Bill Stein","But let's ask David to answer that question on all equity.","David Ruberg","John is in Europe. If you don't mind, I think the real question I'd like to address is, why did we do this and why did we do this now? And the form of the transaction is less important. The real answer is, the infrastructure requirements of our customers are evolving. And as they've evolved, they have created a greater opportunity for us to do business with them.","And we thought that as this has evolved and these 2 companies have evolved, the combination is far greater positioned to take advantage of these opportunities than we were individually. We believe in them, they believe in us. The form of the transaction of the compensation was secondary.","Operator","Our next question will come from Erik Rasmussen with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Erik Rasmussen","Yes, thanks and congrats on the deal announcement. It's obviously on the M&A front, it kind of checks the boxes that you've talked about as strategic and complementary, accretive to -- I will say, the long-term growth on an AFFO basis and you mentioned, prudently financed.","But where do you see sort of the pitfalls of you getting to some of the metrics you've outlined? I know you talked about it previously, the 1% to 2% dilutive and then slightly breakeven and then, we'll call it low single or a reverse of that dilution. Where is some of the pitfalls? And where do you see some of the opportunities for that to even be stronger than you expected?","Andy Power","Thanks, Eric. So I think obviously, the greatest potential risk is obviously this is all about the customers and the people and employees that are making this come together for the customers.","So that's why I think we're going to make sure, we'll go through this in a prudent fashion and bring together 2 great teams in support of these customers and real execution on building out capacity for our customers and being their trusted partner, especially in Europe, but also on a global basis.","So that's certainly something where we're keeping an eye on the ball. There's other things that I would say are secondary in our mind, whether it's achievement on the expense synergies, which I would say are relatively modest in numbers.","And obviously, execution and ability to tap the financing markets to lock in financing synergies. But I really think, it's a continuation at the topline and focus on the customers in order to deliver that EBITDA in 2021, which is going to be the twin spinning for that near-term financial success.","Erik Rasmussen","Okay. Maybe just -- my follow-up, you've mentioned Northern Virginia coming back with a couple of nice deals there. But maybe if it would just talk about the pricing dynamic in that market and in hyperscale deals in general that were signed in the quarter.","Andy Power","Sure. So in Northern Virginia, really, the success there was selling our platform and our value proposition to our customers, which was about a global organization supporting these customers across numerous countries and continents, the full product spectrum and working to land them in Northern Virginia, which is obviously very competitive. But on -- what we think is the best campus, where many of these customers have an installed footprint and want to grow its adjacency. And many of these customers value the longest runway for growth in that market that we provide.","So I think those key elements were really what allowed us to win the day for some of these key signings during the quarter and not have to just compete on rate like some of our private competitors may have had to go.","Obviously, the rates are down there on a year-over-year basis. But I would say, I was quite pleased with the volume and the rate activity. It was a big piece of our North America signings that you can see flowing through our TKF line and our total signings that rated down a little bit quarter-over-quarter but not astronomically. So I think we are really adding value to our customers. They're appreciating that value, and that's why they are picking us. And its not just all about based on bottom rate discussion.","Operator","Our next question will come from Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","This is Michael on for Colby. Two questions if I may. First, I guess, this goes to David. Did Interxion run a full process before agreeing to a deal? Along those lines, is there a formal go-shop period? And secondly, how much leasing came from Ascenty? And what was the Americas pricing for kW, excluding Ascenty, for the quarter? Thank you.","Andy Power","Michael, this is Andy. I'll take the easy one. Ascenty was very small contribution this quarter. They've done a great job the last three consecutive quarters, outperforming our underwriting. But this quarter, I think it was like $1.5 million of GAAP or so. So very small contribution.","And that's not to say I'm not -- I'm still optimistic. We just, we're meeting with the Ascenty team and Chris have a pretty good pipeline for the fourth quarter. But what actually we reported on our signings was very relatively small of our Americas signings number. With that, I'll hand it back over to David.","David Ruberg","Contrary to what was in the press, we did not run a process. What we have basically done is for the last couple of years, we've been approached by a lot of people. We were focused on what we thought it would take to be successful. We were focused on what we thought a good partner would look like. And Bill and I have been talking about this for quite some time, and it was just the appropriate thing to do. And that's how we got here.","In terms of what happens from now, you can expect that there is a standard terms and conditions. But this deal to me makes a lot of sense. And again, that's why we've had this conversation for quite some time. So we'll see what happens, but I'm focused on making this the best opportunity that we can. We spent enough time getting to know each other. I think we know what we're doing.","Operator","Our next question will come from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Rob on for Frank, actually. Post the deal, what do you believe will be your approximate percentage of revenue from Northern Virginia?","Andy Power","Hey, Rob, this is Andy. That's a very good question. We have -- let me see if I can handicap this. There's a slide on our deck that shows a pro forma -- Slide 11 shows the pro forma geographic concentration. That doesn't have -- it shows pods but doesn't have numbers. But the pods are -- just over 60% are from the Americas; about 30, a little over 30% or 33, I believe, percent from EMEA; and about 6% from APAC. If you look in one of the pages in our south, Northern Virginia, it's still our top market. But I would kind of hit a cap in the 10% to 15% of the total pro forma combined company.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jon Petersen","Thank you. So maybe one question on the quarter and then one question on the deal. So the same capital NOI, I noticed, was down 2.6% -- or sorry, 3.7% on a cash basis year-over-year, 2.5% sequentially. And it looks like occupancy dropped 100 basis points. Maybe if you could just give us a more color on what's going on there?","Andy Power","Thanks, Jon. So same capital pool, really, it's about the company's obviously largest expiration year. We've done a quite a good job, renewing a lot of contracts, pushing out for staggered various terms. There are -- and even though our retention's a little bit above historical average, we've taken back a fair bit of space to tip that pull.","So we do have some downtime for releasing.","And I would say we saved a significant chunk of our new signings in this quarter and last quarter was little bit more into new space that's going to be the delivering. So, little bit of interim cash flow hit.","I do think it is a temporary phenomenon. Some of this capacity, I think, Dublin is a good example. We're taking back and we're going to convert TKF suite into a colocation interconnection product offering. So, we think that does provide longer term up sign, although you do have the near-term cash flow hit.","So, I think there a lot of other good things about the quarter, which thinking a lot of question so far in addition to this quarter, I think a third-highest almost just sniffing our second-highest from last year, it was pretty multi-geographic, multiproduct.","Interconnection was up there in terms of number two or three, I think, in terms of signings in the last handful of years and a record 64 new logos. I believe the new logos we signed in the first three quarters this year are more than new logos we signed in the prior two years, so pretty happy about that.","But we are having some -- taking back some non-retaining capacity and we're certainly focusing our salesforce on selling to that move-in ready space, tour the day move-in tomorrow type capacity that does certainly help us in certain markets.","Jon Petersen","Okay. Thanks. And then just curious, the Interxion business, will that be good REIT income that will require a dividend payout? And if not, how does that change your thoughts on growing the dividend going forward?","Andy Power","Based on our -- other than maybe a relatively short time period at the initial close, depending on the tender of the shares where we would have to hold the business in our TRS temporary, we would qualify this as good REIT income based on everything we've seen to-date.","So, I don't see this as a drag on our TRS capacity or incremental corporate tax friction. And so based on what we see, this looks very similar in terms of readability to our core business.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Yes. First question, just strategically, you guys have been extraordinarily active at building out the global platform. And different from your original M&A deals early on, the last few have been dilutive in the near-term, part driven by development, part driven by deleveraging and asset sales, but they'll eventually be accretive. But it just feels as though whether it was Ascenty, the Macquarie deal, this Interxion deal, you sort of pushed the growth to eventually coming.","What gives investors confidence that you won't do another a deal next year that then impacts 2021 growth and we're just on the sort of flat cycle until you eventually get to a more positive growth outlook?","Andy Power","Thanks Michael. So, I think the three transactions, two buys and one sell, I think, have their nuances of near-term or temporary dilution followed by what we see as accretion. Obviously, Ascenty was a pretty strategic entry, acquiring the leading platform in Brazil, which was subsequently expanded into Santiago, Chile, which was a very large in-flight construction project essentially. So, very little near-term earnings. And also we suffer dilution in how we mitigated the risk and that transaction.","The sale of the assets -- when you sell $1 billion in change of assets, so the low six cap and you lose that income right away, you're certainly going to have dilution to your per share FFO rate. And this transaction has its unique nuances with a closing sometime in 2020, timing of synergy, realizations are light where there's dilution.","I think we're still focused on driving the growth in our FFO, AFFO, cash flow per share. It's what pays our dividends. But at the same time, I think we're looking at especially this transactions, the keystone strategic piece and global platform. And this is part of the reason why we prepare for transactions like this. Hence why we've kept the balance sheet in such good shape, why we've run the AFFO payout ratio so conservatively. It's been close to 70% or south, so very well covered. So, this mild dilution is temporary and I don't think a repeat story. And I think we're positioning the company for growth from all three of these initiatives quite honestly. And we do ask our investors to bear with us and the noise in the earnings and the ensuing handful of quarters. But we think we\u2019re setting ourselves up for a stronger platform with accelerating growth.","Bill Stein","Hey Michael, let me also add to that. As David indicated, he and I have been talking for many years now. And the same is true for Chris Torto, we've been talking -- we talked for many years before we closed on that transaction. So these are opportunities that we've been tracking and have been interested in for a long time. There is nothing like that on our horizon today. I can say that unequivocally that we are not talking with anyone else. And that's not to say we won't do another acquisition, but right now, our plate is full.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. And then just something specific related to the deal, and it's been a long time since I've been an investment banker. Can you just walk through -- you said it was a 7% color in terms of a bid protection, and you have matching rights up to that 7%. And then it sounded like there was a 1% on equity breakup fee to any other bidder that would come in, so call it $1 a share per InterXion share. How does that 7% overbid with matching rates work?","Greg Wright","It's a little different, Michael. It's Greg. It's a 1% breakup fee. And then it's what's called a 7% overbid color. So it means is someone who comes in, if they would top the deal, they would have to pay 1%. And in order to top the deal, they have to be 7% above our bid. So that's how that works.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you. My main question has to do with slide number 17, and some of the rental rate changes that you've seen, you reported 7.2% cash now in the industry and across some of the private data center operator. There has been probably pricing weakness and essentially cost per kilowatt reduction is down. However, you guys have clearly executed and reported a pretty; I would describe it as strong result at 7.2% above right positive. Can you just give us more color on how you are driving those results, what your customer are doing? Are they deploying to multiple locations? That\u2019d be very helpful color for industry numbers.","Andy Power","Sure, Sami. This is Andy again. So, I would want to say, we've certainly had our fair share of negative cash mark-to-markets. And you can look at back in the last quarter as a prime example.","This quarter, we were able to have the uplift for a handful of contracts, most notably when the large legacy DFT customers renewed at a shorter duration, the shorter duration that typically comes with a higher rate. So that would certainly contributor, as well as some other contracts were renewed during the quarter that kind of was able to drive a positive cash mark-to-market spread.","It really all goes back to the vintage of the agreement, the market and supply\/demands with fundamentals within that specific market and also the product segment. So while we're certainly quite pleased with the outcome of the third quarter, I'm not under the assumption that we're going to repeat plus 7% every quarter for the next four or five, we\u2019ll certainly have our ups and downs.","But net-net, I do think we are moving through our largest expiration of the year. We've had several record renewal quarters in a row, numerous top customer, multiyear, multiproduct renewals, staggering out those expirations. You can see as we've whittled down what's coming due in 2019 and beyond.","And I do think these ties back to a comment you made is that really about selling the platform, the multiproduct, multi-geo offering to our customers, really trying to be a trusted partner and a solution provider to them. So they have one responsible party around the globe to assist them with whether it's a renewal in one market, expansion in other, network node, you name it. That's really how we're trying to drive the business. And I do think that does pay a little bit of dividends to our success overall.","Sami Badri","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Richard Choe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Choe","Hi. I wanted to revisit, kind of, the longer term outlook the deal provides in terms of the amount of development under construction. How we should think about that growth? And then also the future capacity because it, seems like this is more of a longer-term strategic deal and not necessarily something that's going to impact things right away. And that probably drove more the transaction? Thank you. ","Andy Power","Hey, Richard. This is Andy. I can speak to the numbers here. There's a slide on the deck that, I think, paints a nice picture of the growth profile. I think it's slide 10. What's quite unique about this transaction, in addition to the broader global strategic nature of it, it really is kind of two interlocking puzzle pieces in terms of inventory and portfolio footprint.","As I've mentioned, we basically topped off our growth in the Frankfurt market, and the InterXion team has done a great job bringing inventory on in the near future, so filling in gaps there. In London, that's a market where we've been having a pretty nice and future proofed runway for growth with our cloud house digital documents campus as well as our Crawley and working campuses. And that was more of a newer market.","Similarly in France, we just reentered Paris, and the InterXion team has a dominant share in multimarkets in France. So let's call it 18 months out. I think we got a very complimentary inventory position, which we'd like. That includes over 80 megawatts under construction from InterXion that are north 40% pre-leased. We're bringing 40 megawatts to the table at about 40% pre-leased. So I think that kind of dovetails for the near-term picture.","And then longer term, the Interxion team really done a fantastic job building out a long-term runway of growth clearly where they either own lease or options on several years' worth of inventory in strategic markets, including some of the budding growth markets outside of the Frankfurt, London and St. Paris market traditionally known for such a strong hold for. So I think it's a combination of near and longer-term growth.","Richard Choe","And will that -- this kind of options help you bridge the gap or when you start integrating the sales forces? And how should we think about the sales force integration going forward?","Andy Power","I think, this inventory set up is a fantastic thing for our customers. And when our customers have lots of opportunity to move into our footprint of combined company basis, that usually is a good for our sales force at the same time. We are just on the heels of announcement we got. We obviously got to work independently until our shareholders approve of this transaction and we close. And once we close, we're going to work together as well to combine. And with that, I think David wants to chime in.","David Ruberg","I just wanted to add, what's fascinating about this combination is when you look at the top 15 or 20 platform players in the world, we actually overlap substantially. But we approach them from two different orientations, one from the large size and one from the small size. And so when you look at this, even the sales forces are highly complementary in terms of the way they approach. When you look at the combined with a number of the top 3 or 4 customers, when you put these two companies together and you look at the relevance that we have as a combined entity for some of these behemoths, it's really impressive. So, it's not going to be as difficult to bring them together, because they bring complementary knowledge. One more on the compute side, one more on the connectivity side. So, I think it works.","Operator","This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks.","Bill Stein","Thank you, Sean. I'd like to wrap-up our call today by recapping the strategic merits of our combination with Interxion, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation.","The combined company will extend Interxion's successful strategy of creating and enabling valuable communities of interest in Europe by extending it across the combined companies' global footprint.","Our businesses are highly complementary. The combination creates a leading pan-European data center provider, offering consistent, high quality services with low-latency access to approximately 70% of the GDP in Europe.","Interxion's co-location capabilities combined with our hyperscale expertise will significantly enhance the combined companies' activity to address and solve our company's public and hybrid cloud architectural requirements on a global scale.","Interxion has five projects under construction, which are over 40% pre-leased and represent a 40% expansion of the asset base and a source of significant potential embedded growth and long-term value creation.","Last but not least, the transaction is expected to generate significant financial benefit. It's expected to be accretive to the long-term growth rate of the combined organization and will establish a global platform that we believe will significantly enhance our ability to create long-term value for both the customers, shareholders and employees of both companies.","Thank you all for joining us, and we hope to see many of you at marketplace live at Spring Studios in New York next week.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

My name is Mackenzie, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Garibaldi, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Pamela M. Garibaldi","Thank you, Mackenzie. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the Digital Realty earnings press release. If you have not, you can access one in the Investor section of our website at www.digitalrealty.com or you may call (415) 738-6500 to request a copy.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the management of Digital Realty may make forward-looking statements on this call.

Again, that's www.digitalrealty.com.","Now I'd like to introduce Michael Foust, CEO; and Bill Stein, CFO and Chief Investment Officer. Following management's brief remarks, we will open the call to your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael F. Foust","Great. Thank you, Pamela, and welcome to the call, everyone. I'll begin today's call with a few comments regarding the important global network connectivity initiatives we announced yesterday, and will follow up with a brief summary of our first quarter operations. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our recent capital markets activity and first quarter financial results. Following his remarks, we'll open the call to your questions.","During the Q&A today, we're pleased to have with us John Sarkis, our Vice President of Network and Carrier Operations, and he's available to answer specific questions related to yesterdays Digital Realty Ecosystem announcement.","As stated in that announcement, the launch of this strategic initiative takes our global portfolio to the next level in terms of providing customers with a carrier-neutral network connectivity offering. From the beginning, our strategy has been to consolidate and grow a global portfolio of enterprise-quality data centers. This included acquiring key Internet gateway network hubs, data centers that offer our customers network-intensive applications, which are ideal locations to house their mission-critical business systems. At the same time, we've grown our portfolio of corporate data centers, expanding our footprint by assembling a high concentration of properties in key markets globally. So today by leveraging our global footprint and operating platform, we plan to deploy the Digital Realty Ecosystem across our portfolio, providing a neutral, efficient and connectivity-rich environment for our customers to connect, not only to any carrier of choice, but directly to one another. Beginning with our major campus locations including New York; New Jersey; Boston; Ashburn, Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Santa Clara; as well as Metro London, we'll be running high count dark fiber between buildings, enabling us to offer customers a \"plug and play\" GigE product, as well as straight dark fiber cross-connects to customers carriers and service providers campus-wide. Furthermore, this ecosystem will provide an underlying infrastructure for carriers and service providers to deliver their entire portfolio of products and services to our customers without them incurring the typical capital-intensive deployment cost.","We see this strategy as a critical component of our evolution that will further advance our global leadership position as the data center provider of choice for both wholesale and retail colocation customers. At the same time, it adds significant value to our portfolio, giving us a competitive advantage that is unmatched in the industry.","In addition to this exciting initiative, we are very pleased with the pace of leasing activity so far this year. We achieved our highest level of first quarter lease signings, totaling over $43.7 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, which was also our third-highest quarter on record. The results this quarter, in particular, reflect the success of our Custom Solutions product strategy, enabling us to capture large requirements from cloud infrastructure providers, as well as cloud-based services.","In North America, the average annual gap rental rate for leases signed in the quarter for our Turn-Key Flex pace was $141 per square foot. This compares to the 2012 average rate of $151 per square foot. Please keep in mind that the fourth quarter 2012, the average rate for leases signed was $177 square foot, which was higher than our typical average. We believe that the $141 per square foot is more in line with historical averages over the last couple of years. On a per kW per month basis, the weighted average rental rate was approximately $177 per kW.","For our Custom Solutions product, the average gap rental rate was $108 per square foot, and the weighted average rate for per kilowatt per month was $137. The lease rates for Custom Solutions space reflect the build-to-suit nature of the projects, including the elimination of leasing risk and carry and oftentimes, lower development costs for us based on the customers' engineering requirements and the needs for ancillary space. The stabilized projected ROI for these leases range from 8.3% to 12%.","Markets where we saw the highest global activity in the U.S. included New York, New Jersey, Greater Chicago and Northern Virginia. Recently, Digital Realty entered into an agreement with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership that will allow the company and our tenants in our data center facilities located in Loudoun County to obtain an exemption from sales and use tax on the purchase of certain data center and computer-related equipment. We believe making this favorable tax treatment available to our customers adds significant value to our digital Ashburn campus.","Excluding leases that commenced in the first quarter, the additional signings bringing our total backlog to $84.2 million of annual gap rental revenue. Another record high, of which, $45.3 million is expected to commence in 2013; $21.5 million in 2014, 2015; and $17.4 million expected to commence thereafter. Please note that our backlog represents committed lease contracts that have been signed but have not yet commenced.","By contrast, excluding the leases we signed during the first quarter, our leasing prospects pipeline for our new facilities ticked up slightly from our last call to about 2 million square feet of prospects. This figure represents current prospects in our sales funnel to whom we've made proposals and we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing. Notably, these new requirements tend to fall on categories: The first is the large multi-megawatt requirement similar to the Custom Solution leases we signed in the first quarter. Customers that fall into this category include financial -- global financial institutions, health care, traditional Internet enterprises, social media, cloud providers and large system integrators.","By contrast, the second category consists of customers of varying sizes, representing an even broader range of industry verticals. These customers are often looking to lease data center space in smaller increments, sometimes less than 1 megawatt. These are our more traditional TKF or colocation customers, are looking for move-in ready space with the flexibility to expand then within our portfolio. Offering customers a full suite of data center solutions is key to our strategy and sets us apart from all of the other data center providers in the market. In addition, our geographic footprint scale, combined with our design and construction expertise and offering platform, enables us to meet a wide range of customer requirements while achieving attractive return for our shareholders. In fact, the weighted average 1 year -- year 1 stabilized return on investments for Turn-Key leases signed during the quarter was just over 13%.","In terms of overall supply and demand, there are a handful of U.S. markets that have had meaningful shifts. For example, more than 3-megawatts either way up or down, from what we provided in our Analyst Day presentation. Moving east to west, we are now tracking approximately 36.1 megawatts of potential demand in Northern Virginia, up from 32.2 megawatts. This compares to 24.5 megawatts of supply built or under construction currently. Chicago saw one of the largest increases with 34.6 megawatts of track demand, up from 18.1 megawatts previously. This compares to an increase in supply of 6.7 megawatts, resulting in a shortfall of supply approximately 18.3.","Demand in Silicon Valley jumped to 25.5 megawatts from 9.4 at the end of January as did supply, resulting in a smaller surplus of supply of 4.7 megawatts. While Dallas still shows a healthy level of demand at 25.7 megawatts, it's the only U.S. market that decreased. And they decreased from 32.6 megawatts we reported last quarter. By comparison, supply in Dallas increased only slightly, resulting in a shortfall of supply of about 5.3 megawatts. However, there have been recent announcements of planned new construction for the Dallas metro.","Turning to our lease renewals during the quarter. Including re-leased space, we signed approximately 233,000 square feet of data center space at overall renewal rates that increased 0.8% in a GAAP basis, and decreased 18.2% on a first year cash basis. This decrease was solely due to 2 leases that we renewed with a particular top 5 customer in a New Jersey property. They were signed at the top of the market in 2008, and the renewals were subject to very aggressive pricing by 2 competitors in the New Jersey market. It is important to emphasize that these leases represent only 0.6% of our total annual revenue and do not reflect mark-to-market for the balance of our portfolio. From a strategic perspective, by renewing these leases, we were able to expand the customer into additional data center space in the same building, actually resulting in a net increase of $2.7 million of annualized gap rental revenue for the property.","That said, our portfolio's geographic diversity limits our overall exposure to these markets versus other data center landlords who are concentrated in Northern Virginia, New Jersey and Silicon Valley exclusively. For example, excluding the 2 leases we just noted, rates on renewals were actually up across all product types, including TKF, which was up 18.3% on a cash basis and up 22.7% on a GAAP basis. Powered Base Building was up 0.2% just slightly in the cash basis and up fully 24.5% on a GAAP basis. Colocation, up 14.5% in a cash basis and 14% in GAAP basis. And for nontax space, up 2.3% on a cash basis and 5.6% on a GAAP basis.","As further evidence of the strength and resiliency of our portfolio, including space that re-leased in the quarter, the combined average retention rate for data center space in the quarter was over 97%. On a square foot basis, over 93% of Turn-Key Flex space representing 97% of gap rent, renewed in an average term of nearly 107 months. We also renewed, re-leased 100% of expiring PBB space, reflecting 124.5% of gap rent, with an average lease term of over 147 months. The healthy length of renewals, along with the annual 2.5% to 3% contractual increases, allows us to recapture any decline in cash rents after year 2 or 3 on the new term on average with continuously growing cash flow thereafter. Looking at our projected renewal activity for the balance of 2013 and for the full years 2014, 2015, we project rent spreads for data center space to be relatively flat on a cash basis and up approximately 20% on a GAAP basis.","Occupancy was 94% in the first quarter, down slightly from 94.4% the previous quarter, primarily due to the expiration of non-data center lease, office lease in a tech building in Fremont, California. We're currently marketing space to office users and will consider selling the property once it's been stabilized. This decrease was partially offset by the commencement of new leases, totaling 27,000 square feet on our existing data center inventory; the commencement of leases from our development program, totaling nearly 94,000 square feet and the acquisition of 4 100% leased buildings. Same-store occupancy also decreased for the fourth quarter slightly, 93.7% to 93.1%, due to the same non-data center office lease expiration.","Turning now to our acquisitions program. We began the year with a healthy level of activity that included 2 properties, totaling 4 buildings that were 100% leased, one of which was the sale-leaseback with a major airline in the Minneapolis metro. The blended going-in, unlevered cash cap rate for the first quarter stabilized acquisitions was over 11%. In addition, we acquired another development project adjacent to our Chandler, Arizona property for running future inventory in this growing data center market, as well as a development project in suburban Toronto, Canada where we're seeing significant demand from new and existing customers for data center space.","Our current pipeline and prospects for acquisition totals nearly $1 billion including high-quality stabilized property, value-add opportunities, ground up development sites, as well as sale-leaseback transactions. This does exclude larger portfolios that we continue to track.","Finally, I will briefly review our development program. We continue to ramp up construction to add supply in select markets to meet current demand. Current development activity includes nearly 549,000 square feet of Turn-Key Flex space that is 14.3% pre-leased, over 200 -- over 276,000 square feet of Custom Solutions space that is 100% pre-leased, and approximately 564,000 square feet of Powered Base Buildings for future inventory in key markets. Detailed information in our development activity by market can be found on Page 29 of our first quarter supplemental package.","We are very pleased with the strong start to 2013 and are equally excited about the new initiatives we are working on and we believe will further enhance the value of our global portfolio. These initiatives, combined with our commitment to delivering a wide range of superior data center solutions for our customers, will continue to drive earnings growth.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill.","Arthur William Stein","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with reviewing our capital markets activity, and then discuss our first quarter 2013 financial performance and guidance. Year-to-date, we have sourced nearly $885 million of new capital, including the GBP 400 million 12-year unsecured note bond offering with 4.25% coupon, which was equivalent to USD 634.9 million based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance, and the 5.875% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock offering in April, which generated gross proceeds of $250 million.","Our funding strategy includes issuing debt in local currencies to provide a natural hedge, mitigating our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our growing international operations. Local debt, as a percentage of regional in-country assets, range from 50% to 96% depending upon the country.","In reviewing our balance sheet, total assets grew to $9 billion in the first quarter compared to $8.8 billion last quarter, which is consistent with the continued growth and scale of our business. Deferred rent increased by $19.1 million to $340.8 million this quarter, compared to $321.7 million last quarter due to incremental new leases. Deferred rent as a percentage of rental revenue at 7.5%, remains consistent with our historical average.","Total debt increased to $4.7 billion at the first quarter 2013 compared to $4.3 billion last quarter. We currently have $1.5 billion of immediate liquidity, including $84.5 million in short-term investments plus funds that can be drawn on our credit facility. If this capacity were fully utilized, we would remain in full compliance with covenants contained in the credit facility, our term loan, our Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt. In 2013, we had $219 million of remaining principal amortization and debt maturities with a weighted average cost of 6%, which we plan to retire initially with the revolver and eventually refinance with additional long-term unsecured debt, secured debt or preferred stock.","Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.5x at quarter end, up from 5.2x at the end of the fourth quarter last year. This increase is due to additional borrowings to fund the development and acquisitions program. Pro forma for the recently issued preferred equity, net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 5.2x. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio decreased to 3.5x at the end of the first quarter compared to 3.8 in the previous quarter.","Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, first quarter 2013 FFO was $1.16 per share in line with fourth quarter 2000 FFO of $1.16, and up 9.4% from first quarter 2012 FFO of $1.06 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent core expenses or revenue streams, first quarter 2013 core FFO was $1.18 per share, $2.9 million higher than reported FFO. These adjustments largely resulted from transaction expenses and fair value adjustments related to the central earnout. As I noted on our last call, a fair value assessment on the 3-year Sentrum earnout obligation is required in each reporting period and is likely to result in some quarterly earnings fluctuation. Changes in fair value are considered noncore adjustments.","Quarter-over-quarter, core FFO decreased slightly from $1.19 per share in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher interest expense, as well as G&A and tax expenses, which were offset by higher NOI in the first quarter and was up 11.3% from first quarter 2012 core FFO of $1.06 per share. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the first quarter of 2013 was $123.6 million, up $115.8 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter of 2013 was 84.1%, up from 82.6% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $212.6 million grew by 4.2% from $204 million last quarter and was up by 23.6% from $172 million in the first quarter of 2012.","Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $7.7 million or 3.5% to $227.3 million in the first quarter of 2013 and from $219.6 million last quarter. The increase was due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions, as well as approximately $900,000 in insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Sandy. These are partially offset by an increase in property taxes and the present value accretion adjustment related to the Sentrum earnout as previously mentioned. Property, taxes increased by $1.3 million to $21 million in the first quarter 2013 from $19.7 million last quarter due to tax assessments at 2 properties, a portion of which was recoverable from tenants.","NOI margins, excluding utility reimbursements, increased by 60 basis points and remained consistent with historical levels. Likewise, first quarter same-store NOI increased by $9.3 million to $195.4 million, compared to $186.1 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight-line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $174.7 million in the first quarter up 5.6% from $165.4 million last quarter. The increase quarter-over-quarter was largely due to an incremental revenue from new leasing and the insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Sandy previously mentioned.","G&A increased to $16 million in the first quarter compared to $13.4 million in the last quarter, primarily due to certain 2012 year-end accrual adjustments amounting to $1.9 million, which reduced G&A in the fourth quarter. Interest expense increased by $7.7 million to $48.1 million in the quarter from $40.4 million last quarter primarily due to the sterling bond issuance and lower capitalized interest in the quarter. Tax expense increased to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $10,000 last quarter, primarily due to noncash deferred taxes based on booked-to-tax differences from foreign operations.","While we do not give quarterly guidance, I would like to bring your attention to a few items that we anticipate will impact next quarter's results. First, our Series G Preferred Offering which closed in early April, will result in approximately $3.4 million of incremental preferred stock dividends in the second quarter, which will be partially offset by interest expense savings of $830,000 from repayment of revolver borrowings. Second, we expect NOI growth to be partially offset by $800,000 each quarter through the rest of the year due to the non-data center lease expiration at the Fremont, California tech office property, which Mike referenced in his remarks. And third, while we are not revising 2013 guidance at this time, we are closely monitoring foreign exchange rates and plan to revisit their impact on our 2013 guidance at the end of next quarter.","Finally, in reviewing consensus estimates, there are a few items that do not appear to be reflected in some of the 2013 models. The first item relates to $3.4 million increase in capitalized interest in the fourth quarter of 2012 from the third quarter that was due to the inclusion of additional qualifying activity. We expect capitalized interest to normalize at approximately $5 million per quarter. Also as a reminder, we manage to a 5.5x debt to adjusted EBITDA.","As I discussed at our Analyst Day event in January, our 2013 guidance assumptions include $900 million to $1 billion of bond issuance, $300 million to $400 million of preferred or common, as well as a small increase in the balance of the revolver. As I mentioned in my opening remarks today, we've issued $635 million of bonds and $250 million of preferred stock. We expect to access both the debt and equity markets later this year to raise the balance of capital required to meet our 2013 funding requirements. Subject to market conditions, we may choose to issue additional common or preferred equity or unsecured debt to further enhance our financial flexibility. These assumptions would exclude additional capital associated with any significant portfolio acquisition, which is not included in our guidance. This includes -- this concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My question centers around the network connectivity focus here and how that might influence your approach to M&A going forward and whether it -- maybe it changes the likelihood that you will look to purchase a wholesale-oriented asset. As well, I would be interested in seeing if you could ballpark the revenue uplift that you might see longer term just within your existing properties and existing base of tenant leases from customers that used to cross connect with each other and presumably that becomes a revenue event for you?","Michael F. Foust","Sure, yes. We think this is going to be, really, a big benefit to our customers who are either requiring network access, customers who are carriers themselves who are ISPs, customers who are providing peering and cross connecting as we'll be able to pull more customers to them, as well as leasing more in our properties. In terms of revenue, we think that there's going to be, certainly, a material uplift, especially after we get all the infrastructure in place next year, by the end of this year and will realize in the end of the year in 2014. We haven't fully defined our product set at this point. A lot of the financial benefit will be from making our buildings much -- even more attractive to a wide range of customers, including cloud providers, infrastructure, ISPs and carriers. So it will help to ramp up our leasing activity. And we expect to be able to rent more space in our network pops, in our spaces, in our buildings.","John Sarkis, I'd like John to comment on kind of the overall program and the benefits.","John Sarkis","Okay. Thank you, Mike. Yes, I guess in looking at the size of our portfolio, we have very large amount of buildings, and there's attractiveness on the wholesale and the retail side. By putting an ecosystem in place, all our buildings can accommodate both ends of the spectrum for our offering. So any new buildings that come online will automatically fall right into the ecosystem and operate seamlessly across the entire portfolio.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And in terms of CapEx or OpEx implications, just because you talked about connecting building and cities together and so forth, can you maybe discuss that a little bit?","Michael F. Foust","Yes. I mean, the operating expense will be pretty low and on the increment, because it's spread across almost our entire, portfolio. We'll probably be -- on the capital side, we'll probably be investing somewhere around, oh, probably no more than $25 million over the next 9 months or so. But then that's -- once again, that's spread out over a very large number of buildings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to -- my follow-up there to the connectivity initiative surrounds sort of the competition with some of your existing customers. And to the extent that you're, I guess, engaging their customers and their product offerings to or -- offering similar products to a greater extent. Is that sort of the nature of the business, this sort of virtual -- vertical integration that you're seeing? And now that you're doing it basically across your sort of core cities, that you just -- the overlap is just to an increasing extent?","Michael F. Foust","Well, it's really for us to be able to put in the infrastructure so our current customers and new customers can more readily offer their services across our portfolio and be able to connect, have the infrastructure and to connect everyone. We're not going into the carrier business at all. And John, I'll let John comment a little more on that.","John Sarkis","Yes, we are not, and I like to overemphasize the word, not becoming a network provider. What we're doing is we're making it easier for carriers and service providers to deliver their services to our customers across our entire portfolio. And that is what our customers have been asking and looking for. And our carrier partners, as well as our data center industry partners there are looking for ease to navigate through our entire portfolio. And this ecosystem will provide them with the seamless cost efficient and secure environment that they look for.","Michael F. Foust","In other words, you can get to from, hopefully, any building in our portfolio to virtually any carrier, any Meet Me Room, any cross-connect peering platforms, any cloud infrastructure provider. And in that way, should be driving more business for everyone who resides or has facilities in a Digital Realty portfolio property.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","I just had a question on your international portfolio. It looks like in early March, you made an investment in Mexico but I didn't see anything mentioned in the release or in your prepared remarks. Just wondering what that was and kind of what your plan is for that market?","Michael F. Foust","Sure. We think there's opportunities for us in several locations in Mexico. The investment that we're making, it haven't fully closed yet, is a very small minority investment, about 8.5%, in one of our customers in Mexico City who's a metro fiber provider. And we've done work for them on data center design and project management. And what this will let us do, making a small investment, but gives us the ability to have a good lens into the growth and evolution of the Mexico market in Mexico City. Guadalajara, Monterrey, so we can have a good idea, kind of a front-row seat, if you will, on how that market is growing and where demand is for our wholesale products. So that's kind of the genesis of that initiative.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just going back to the capital side of things. The maintenance or recurring CapEx trended a bit lower. Could you just walk us through what exactly drove the decline and perhaps what should we should model going forward?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, and that's probably really kind of reflects first quarter seasonality, if you will, on deploying capital. And I think we'll generally be in line with our projections over the course of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","You did another sale-leaseback this quarter. Can you talk about the demand is for these transactions and what your pipeline looks like given the likely changes to lease accounting making these type of deals less advantageous for the lessee?","Michael F. Foust","We've had good activity. We did the Bouygues Telecommunications wireless company in -- outside of Paris and that was in December. This is the second sale-leaseback that we've done with Delta Air Lines. We're talking with other corporations as well who are interested in freeing up capital from the balance sheet so we're actually -- both in Europe and in the U.S. So it's hard to predict how many of these sorts of deals we'll be doing this year or next year, but we've certainly seen increased interest from corporate owners. That's for certain.","Arthur William Stein","Rob, it's not accounting driven at this point. It's cost to capital driven. Lessees just seize an opportunity to either obtain capital less expensively from us than from their banks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I have a couple on lease expirations. So first, just as a quick clarification. For your Turn-Key and Powered Base building lease expiration schedule, it looks like you added a month-to-month category this quarter, and it looks like some of the leases that went into that bucket were actually previously in the thereafter category as opposed to in 2013. Am I reading that right?","Michael F. Foust","I'm not sure. I don't have the detail.","Arthur William Stein","I don't think so. I think the month-to-month though is really more focused on the colo.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, because it was actually a pretty big step up in Turn-Key and Powered Base. And if you look at the number of leases in thereafter category, they went down. So I'm just trying to get a feel for if you were consolidating leases or reclassing them or something.","Michael F. Foust","No.","Arthur William Stein","No. We'll get back to you with the details, but that wasn't the case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on -- going back to volumes, understanding that was a very strong quarter for you guys driven by Custom Solutions. But just wondering what you're seeing on the TKF front. That seemed like it was, maybe, a little bit lighter than it's been on a historical basis in terms of first quarters. And just maybe some color on why Custom Solutions demand seems to be a little bit stronger right now.","Michael F. Foust","Well, I think we've been seeing, certainly over the last 3 quarters, more interest, I think. As we came out of the recession and demand started to build in the second half of 2012, we're seeing companies looking at some large requirements out there that tend to be more of a build-to-suit nature and more of a custom-design nature. I think that the relative breakout this quarter between Turn-Key Flex and Custom Solution wasn't unusually large. I mean, we're dealing with a very small data set. So I think over the course of the year, it's going to even out more, where we'll be leasing more -- relatively more Turn-Key Flex space as we get further into the year. But certainly, the Custom Solutions is -- because we have the ability, the design, the project management, the engineering expertise, really gives us the ability to address a big part in the market that a lot of folks don't have ready access to with whom we compete.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It only has 11 parts. No, seriously, I'd like to ask another question in terms of the interconnect product. For a long time, you guys have run Internet gateways and you've had your colocation products, so you could do some interconnect there. And the ability to tie together your data centers has always been there through the use of the carriers or the fiber backbones that set led into your centers. What's evolved from a demand perspective today that kind of brings a call to action for this? Is it the need to move workloads in and out of, say cloud environments? or is it the desire to extend the Internet gateways to the other data centers. I'm just trying to understand why now is the right time for the investment?","Michael F. Foust","Sure. And I'll let John jump in on this. In terms of timing, we probably should've done it 2 years ago in anticipation of this growth -- great growth in cloud. And -- but we think that we have an opportunity now. We're not late, but -- and as we're seeing more and more with new data centers coming online, our customers want the ability to have a ready solution from a range of carriers and ISPs and cloud infrastructure providers. And we want to be able to present that to customers, either existing customers as well as new customers coming into new buildings. And we want have that package of services in a very organized, well-defined manner. And I'll let John embellish on those odds.","John Sarkis","And that was a very good question. As you can see the evolution of the business and the market, bandwidth has created a dependency on the data center provider. It's become a much more critical component than just space and power. By providing our customers the ability to access their networks and the size of the bandwidth that they require is what the driving component here to get this rolled out as quickly as possible, though we've seen a lot of questions come in about very large bandwidth demands and structured deployment in a customized solution across our data center portfolio where we have one location would act as more as a production environment, whereas some of our other locations would act as a disaster recovery component or less critical equipment. But the two need to be tied together. So by providing this ecosystem, we will now be able to do that for our customers in a one-stop-shop format.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach with the ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, just a question on the balance sheet. You mentioned that the leverage is creeping up and, I guess, will creep up a bit more through the year, and you are putting more debt on the line of credit than you have in the past. I guess, why the change in the balance sheet strategy over the last 6 or 9 months? And I guess what level from a net debt to EBITDA or fixed charge coverage and also floating rate debt exposure are you comfortable with?","Arthur William Stein","Hey, George, I don't know that there's been a change per se other than we went to the rating agencies in the fall, and we talked to them about running the company at 5.5x versus 5x, and they were comfortable with that. And we think given the scale of the company's operations and the diversification across various verticals and tenants around the world that, that was totally appropriate. Frankly, if you look at -- where most REITs, BBB-rated REITs, run their leverage they, I think, 6 is probably more typical than 5.5. So 5.5 is still on the conservative side.","We ended up at end of the quarter 5.5 but, as I said in my remarks, we very consciously did a preferred, we weren't sure whether we're going to do it at the end of the quarter or at the beginning of the second quarter, and that took the leverage back to where it was at the end of the year which was 5.2x. And because we are managed to 5.5, that doesn't mean that we won't go over occasionally. But we're targeting a 5.5x debt to EBITDA, and we think -- oh, and your question 2 is, I guess, fixed charge coverage. And our target there is to stay in the high 2s or above. And so the fixed charge did go down in the first quarter and that was primarily due to the sterling bond offering that was done in January, which had a 4 1\/4% coupon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe with UBS.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the occupancy drop, that 1 11 8. And Mike, you may have mentioned this in your remarks and I missed it. But what do you think the mark to market is on rents for the portfolio today?","Michael F. Foust","1 11 8, we really didn't have much of a drop. We had one customer who moved into one of our other buildings. And then we're re-leasing that. I think we've already re-leased that space. So...","Arthur William Stein","It will commence second quarter.","Michael F. Foust","Commencing second quarter, this quarter. So yes, you just caught that building kind of in between re-leasing. So that space at 1 11 8, it's actually 100% occupied now.","And in terms of mark to market, we talked about how we're seeing renewals over the next couple of years being flat on a cash basis, a very high rate. So historically high rates based on the cash uplift that we've been enjoying in the leases on average. So we think that mark to market on a GAAP basis is probably -- and this is really just a projection on my part, you're talking 5% to 10% probably, or maybe at least I would think in that case, on a GAAP basis, maybe even slightly more.","Arthur William Stein","Depends on the product class, too. PBB will have a much higher uplift than Turn-Key.","Michael F. Foust","Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Stewart with Green Street Advisers.","John Stewart - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Bill, could you please shed a little bit of light on the Sentrum earn-out, maybe specifically how it's performing relative to pro forma and kind of help us tie that back to the earnings noise? And then, Mike, came across a story recently indicating that you guys were prepared to make your initial foray into mainland China next year, I guess, with sites selected in Shanghai and Beijing. Can you kind of talk about, first of all, how accurate that might be, and the underwriting process, and then the type of returns that you would target in mainland China?","Arthur William Stein","So Mike, relative to the earnout. The earnout is a function of both the rents achieved, the absolute rent level runs, the timing for those rents and the capital deployed to achieve those rents. So that's what goes into the formula to determine the -- whether or not it's a plus or minus. Last quarter, it was a plus. In this quarter, it's a minus. But most of the changes here are going to be accretive. But we don't consider that core. I mean, it's just -- again, it's noise and we have another 2 years and a quarter left of that. And the amount of the adjustment will -- because it's a present value calculation, the amount of the adjustment declines with the passage of time as well. So there will be less as we get closer to the end of the earnout period.","Michael F. Foust","And in terms of our China initiative, we are speaking with -- as we have been over the last couple of years, and meeting with different service providers, both managed services, network providers, cloud providers with whom we might be able to strike up a partnership. So at this point, we're still on an early, relatively early stages of the discussion, but we have targeted a couple of prospects, potentially would be good partners with us in a JV. We feel very strongly in China that to be successful, we want to be partnered with folks that are providing data center services in the marketplace and have the proper licenses for power and fiber, which is so important. So it's still relatively early days but we're definitely interested in that market. I mean, it's many markets obviously in China and probably the 3 most likely forays would be Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. But we're not at a point where we have site selection or agreements drafted or anything like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Michael F. Foust","We lose connection.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, Michael Bilerman speaking. Mike, just as you think about this interconnectivity that you're building out, just given the fact that data center rents and Powered Base building rents are different across the U.S. and internationally, I guess do you anticipate a potential shift of tenants that want access to digital and the benefits that you'll have from the interconnect shifting to lower cost locations? And how you think that sort of evolved, understanding that there is a benefit to going into it, but do you think that there may be a shift in demand going to lower cost locations. That's number one.","Number two, just for Bill, as you talked about how doing local denominated debt in different geographies sort of reduces your FX exposure. And I'm just curious as you think longer term, you look at your sort of largest global REIT peer, Prologis, they want to be 80% to 100% U.S. exposed but have a 60% global x U.S. portfolio. So I'm just curious how -- do you eventually want to move to that as well as, being 100% U.S. exposed with a large global exposure?","Arthur William Stein","Well, I'm not exactly sure what your question there is, Michael. I will tell you that our philosophy is to, to the extent we can, we'll put more debt against the foreign assets to provide maximum natural hedge. So -- and right now our largest market exposure is the U.K.. We're a little over 50% there. Most of the Asian countries are in the 90s right now in terms of debt as a -- local debt as a percentage of the net asset in that region. So it sounds like we might have a different philosophy than Prologis, if I understand your question correctly.","Michael F. Foust","And let me go ahead and answer Michael's part of first question regarding kind of locational decisions. I don't think we're going to see a significant shift, and I'll let John jump in on this, but we're seeing across our major markets, folks who need to be in London and New Jersey and Virginia still want to be there. And there's folks who want to be in central time zone or in lower cost environments and are looking at Dallas and Austin and Houston. And there's folks who need to be in Silicon Valley. So I don't think we're going to see a shift away from a particular market. I think we're going to see more opportunities for our portfolio broadly. John, what do you see there?","John Sarkis","Yes, I just like to add one thing to those comments. In when looking at a market, you have a different buildings that are gateway buildings and non-gateway buildings. We will be re-leasing the ecosystem to level the value of our portfolio buildings across the entire platform, making some of our properties much more valuable than they are outside the ecosystem. So if you're looking at a market where there are the 3 major gateway buildings and then we have a number of other buildings outside the gateway, those buildings become that much more desirable and offer the, what I mentioned earlier, the customized solution of splitting a footprint across the region and our building. I hope that answers the question.","Michael F. Foust","So a lot of it is diversification within a region or across major markets, but not necessarily going to tertiary areas, or at least based on the customer base that we're seeing growing quickly for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Rand with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Rand - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color in your prepared remarks on the cash spreads on the leases signed during the quarter, but I'll confess when I saw the supplement this morning, I was a little surprised to see that -- the big negative number on Turn-Key. What it seems like, from your remarks and from everything we're hearing in the market is that, there is increasing divergence between different markets between different density levels between all sorts of things. And there's kind of 2 key pieces of information that we don't know about your portfolio. One is kind of where the expirations are over the next couple of years. And the other is what the kilowatts or kilowatt levels are across the portfolio as opposed to square footage, which really actually drives your leasing. Can you provide some color for all of us on the call so that we sort of have a little better sense of how the next couple of years might unfold in terms of lease roll?","Michael F. Foust","Well, I mean we've got a lot of information in supplementals about the rolls. I mean, it's spread out across a lot of different markets. So it's hard to make a broad characterization other than, on average, we think we're in a good position broadly on the renewals and folks want and need to stay in our buildings. So it's difficult in this call to draw broad conclusions because we are in so many different markets, and as you know, we have different product types. Bill, I...","Arthur William Stein","Yes, I mean, I think in terms of broad brush, it's safe to assume that the Powered Base, as I said earlier, is going to have a pretty substantial uplift as they renew. And there's several factors that are driving that. It's not just where the rents were struck and the timing for the initial rents, but typically that was 10 -- those are 10- to 15-year initial deals, so they were some time ago. It's also because the tenants have invested significant capital in that space and have a -- and they tend to be quite sticky as a result of that.","The Turn-Key rents started out at a much higher level. If it once again -- I mean, the tenants although they didn't invest in the data center infrastructure the way the Powered Base customers do, they still have significant investment in their space. And we covered this on our analyst day, relocation costs are significant even for our Turn-Key customer. And for that reason, we think it's with certain exceptions. We had one of those exceptions this quarter for a major customer that was under attack in a market where there's been some weakness. On a percentage basis, it was small overall. But with certain exceptions, we would expect that the cash rents on Turn-Key would be roughly flat on a mark-to-market basis across the portfolio regardless of region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess that explanation from Matt was helpful. Just a couple of things, though. Just in regards to the renewals in the New Jersey market and the much lower rent that those were signed for to keep those tenants. Can you just talk a little bit about overall competition in Jersey and what you're seeing?","Michael F. Foust","Yes. New Jersey, it's definitely good market because you've got the financial services and many large corporations in the region. The challenge is there's a couple or 3 competitors who are very aggressive on pricing and have had challenges getting traction with their developments and thus are being aggressive in that market. So I think that's probably the market where we're seeing a little more downward push on rents, but I don't think rents are going down further. I think they stabilized probably last quarter. But there is, in that particular market, probably a couple of folks who are trying to grab market share and trying to get absorption, and they've had some challenges.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Michael F. Foust","Great. Well, thank you very much, and then thanks, everyone, for your time and good comments and questions today. And thank you to the Digital team. It's another quarter well done, and we're really excited about our Digital Realty Ecosystem. I think it's going to make -- bring a lot of value for our customers and for new customers. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's interactive broadcast. You may now disconnect."],"7054":["Digital Realty Trust, Inc.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that today's event is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson and Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Dan Papes are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future results, including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 2015 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. 2016 was a very good year for Digital Realty. We delivered solid execution against each of the objectives of our strategic plan outlined here on page 2 of our earnings deck. We remain focused on realizing the highest possible risk adjusted returns. We achieved a 30 basis point improvement in our return on invested capital in 2016, bringing the cumulative three year gain to 180 basis points.","Given the size of our asset base, we believe this represents a meaningful movement of the needle since 2013. We made substantial headway towards the successful integration of Telx. We also closed on another strategic acquisition, a portfolio of eight high-quality carrier-neutral data centers in Europe. This acquisition was accretive, prudently financed and coincided with our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.","We also advanced our goal of diversifying our product offerings, with the launch of our Service Exchange in November, the continued growth of our Partners and Alliances Program and the expansion of our colocation footprint beyond the original 20 Telx locations. We also made solid progress towards our goal of achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in cash flow and value per share. We hit our target for 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion two years ahead of plan.","We also beat the high-end of our original guidance range, delivering 9% growth in core FFO per share and 22% growth in AFFO per share. Both metrics are on an as reported basis. On a constant currency basis, FFO per share growth would be in double-digits and AFFO per share growth would be north of 23%. Just, as importantly, we were able to achieve this growth without levering up. In fact, we actually reduced leverage by almost half-a-turn in 2016.","We initially unveiled these three year guidepost at our Investor Day in October 2015. Please mark your calendars for the 2017 edition in New York on December 5. By way of preview, our priorities going forward will be geared towards further developing our considerable base of talent to come together as one fully integrated team centered around our customers.","Let's take a closer look at the expansion of our product offerings on page three. As you know, we launched our Service Exchange last November. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secured connections to multiple cloud service providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide.","Service Exchange provides more value to our customers by simplifying interconnection and making access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable and easier to use than ever before when we went live in 43 facilities across eight markets in November and we are on track to rollout another 17 sites across another nine markets in 2017.","In addition, we will be again offering Layer 3 capabilities during the second quarter. Layer 3 capabilities are a requirement to enable enterprise customers to reliably consume SaaS or Software-as-a-Service offerings from a private cloud environment. This means that our customers will be able to realize the benefits of a full suite of public cloud services, including infrastructure, platform and Software-as-a-Service, without incurring exposure of a traditional public Internet connection.","In a nutshell, this offering will allow our customers to realize the benefit of the public cloud without the complexity or security issues associated with hybrid cloud architectures. In addition to the launch of Service Exchange, we saw an acceleration of our activity in our Partners and Alliances Program during the fourth quarter with a pickup in bookings on our Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM Bluemix as well as a significant back-to-back transaction with a leading IT services provider supporting a publicly-traded healthcare service provider.","I'm pleased to report that our level of activity continues to grow, particularly where we are able to combine our capabilities with those of our partners like the Direct Link Colocation offering with IBM. These programs highlight our unique competitive differentiation with our ability to offer customers a full spectrum of data center solutions from a single cabinet all the way up to multi-megawatt deployments.","We are pleased with the early progress of our Partners and Alliances Program and we are looking forward to taking it to the next level in 2017 under Dan Papes' leadership. You may recall that Dan joined us this past year in November as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27 year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business.","In addition to Dan's experience leading large global direct sales teams, he has significant channels and alliances experience, having led the global cloud and data center business at a $6 billion global IT distributor. As I said, we are excited about the prospects for meaningful growth in our channel program under his leadership.","Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page four. Just last week, Cisco reported that global mobile data traffic grew an estimated 63% in 2016. Looking ahead, Gartner projects that the shift to the cloud will either directly or indirectly impact $1 trillion of IT spending by the year 2020. JLL reports that several major cloud providers anticipate that they will need to triple their existing infrastructure by 2020 to meet that demand.","We are as confident as we've ever been in the long-term demand profile. While cloud leasing activity may have been somewhat front-end loaded in 2016, the long-term trend is clearly marching up and to the right. The outsized leasing volume in the first half of last year grow record absorption for the data center sector in 2016. Current market vacancy rates are in this mid-single digits in most core markets and demand continues to outpace supply. Deal sizes are getting bigger and lumpier, and they no longer have the same cadence.","And the biggest and lumpiest deals do not necessarily translate to the most value creation. For our part, we're taking a much more selective approach to landing the right mix of customers to maximize the long-term value of our global Connected Campus footprint.","Our competitors are largely behaving rationally. But we have seen an uptick in fresh capital targeting the sector. To-date, recent investments have mostly been focused on stabilized assets, perhaps reflecting a tacit acknowledgment that barriers to entry maybe higher that meets the eye.","The floodgates have opened for data center packages coming to market, but the supply of products on the market has not depressed pricing. In fact, values have firmed considerably. Cap rates are in the sixes, and EBITDA multiples are in the mid-teens. This can be somewhat of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the value of our existing portfolio, and it makes our recent acquisitions look particularly compelling.","On the other hand, it also makes it harder for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions, and it potentially introduces new competitors. In summary, development pipelines are active, but pre-leasing is healthy, market vacancy is tight, current construction is concentrated in core markets characterized by robust leasing velocity, and the scars of the lifecycle are still fresh.","Now, let's turn to the macro environment on page five. The economic outlook has improved over the last 90 days, although the timing and ultimate outcome of future policy remains uncertain. Despite the improved outlook, it's still a low growth world, and competition is fierce for the pockets of growth, excuse me, that do exist. We believe we have a set of key competitive advantages, namely, our Global Platform, our brand, our operational track record, and our fortress balance sheet that give us a significant leg up on would be competitors.","That certainly doesn't mean that we can rest on our laurels. We must continue to innovate, continuously improve and provide even greater value to our customers. As you've heard me say many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. We consider ourselves very fortunate to be beneficiaries of highly disruptive technological trends like the shift to the cloud, e-commerce and driverless cars.","Over time, we expect property types that are levered to the digital economy will become increasingly core holdings. Not only do we have the good fortune to be operating in a growth industry, but we believe that we have the best platform. We are well-positioned to come together as one team oriented around our customers and capitalize on unique opportunity in front of us.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over the Andy Power to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $25 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $7 million colocation contribution.","Our fourth quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win a robust, get profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Fourth quarter wins included multiple top cloud service providers signing across multiple continents. They also included strong customer demand from several of our other key verticals, including cable and network, a rapidly growing ridesharing company, connected caller applications, IT service providers and a few diverse customers within our financial services vertical.","We added a total of 50 new logos during the fourth quarter. The lion's share of these new logos were landed by our colocation and interconnection business which has consistently contributed more than $13 million of bookings every quarter since our acquisition of Telx in late 2015. This consistent performance helps smooth out some of the lumpiness inherent in our traditional large footprint leasing particularly in the hyperscale age.","The complementary nature of the colocation and interconnection business with our existing platform was a key part of the strategic rationale for the Telx transaction. That rationale has been proven out over the first year of our stewardship as shown on the M&A scorecard here on page 8. The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, although revenues remain split 50-50 roughly, interconnection continues to outpace colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%.","We expect interconnection revenue will grow faster in 2017 than 2016. From the legacy 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $42 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. We made substantial headways towards realizing the embedded growth potential within the Telx portfolio as evidenced by the 480 basis point pickup in same-store utilization.","This successful lease-up enabled us to achieve 99% of our full year 2016 revenue target. Executing on our revenue plan combined with our performance and operational and corporate cost containment enabled us to significantly exceed our full year 2016 cash EBITDA target of $148 million prior to synergies in addition to our $15 million expense synergy target.","We also laid the ground work for realization of revenue synergies in 2017 and beyond as we began the process of expanding our colocation and the interconnection footprint across eight markets in North America, representing nearly 7 megawatts of incremental capacity.","In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and we look forward to continue progress as we refine our go-to-market strategy, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and across our global Connected Campus network.","In terms of the portfolio of eight European data centers we acquired last year, we are likewise well underway towards a smooth integration. We're able to consolidate all the corporate employees from the acquired business into our existing office. And Rob Coupland, who's appointment as Managing Director for the region was announced last September, is now managing one team out of our combined European headquarters on Gracechurch Street in London.","We are stabilized and on track with our initial underwriting assumptions. By the end of 2017, we expect to have fully integrated the eight new properties into our portfolio.","Turning to our backlog on page 9. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $78 million. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements reminded healthy at just three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10. We retained 75% of fourth quarter lease expirations, roughly in line with our historical average, and we signed $47 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. Cash re-leasing spreads were positive 3.5% for the fourth quarter and positive 2.6% for full year 2016.","During the quarter cash re-leasing spreads were positive across all property types, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals. We do still have pockets of above market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter.","On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2016, and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially to 89.4%, primarily due to taking assignment of a colocation reseller customers PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago, which we discussed on our third quarter call. We are actively negotiating the lease for roughly 25% of the former customer's capacity that will bring us back to breakeven, and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease-up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters.","You may recall, as part of this transaction, we took ownership of the former customer's data center improvement and infrastructure with an original cost basis of approximately $85 million, and a current fair market value of approximately $30 million. This transaction explains the bulk of the $33 million of other revenue on the face of our P&L this quarter. The gain on this lease termination is included in NAREIT defined FFO, but is excluded from core FFO.","The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, and FX represented a 150 to 250 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.","Although our global footprint does expose our reported earnings to currency translation movements, it enables us to satisfy the growing data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we view as a key competitive advantage. Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, same capital cash NOI growth was a positive 2.7% on a reported basis, and up 3.6% on a constant currency basis.","For 2017, same capital cash NOI growth is expected to be similar to full year 2016, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $5.72 for the full-year, an increase of nearly 9% on a reported basis, and up a little over 10% on a constant currency basis.","Growth in AFFO per share was better than 20% for the full year, driven by greater cash flow contribution from our core business, accretion from the Telx acquisition, continued burn-off of straight line rent and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend.","Our current AFFO payout ratio is sub-70%, and while we continue to view retained earnings as our cheapest source of equity capital, the current payout ratio provides flexibility and room for further dividend growth. As usual, we expect our board of directors will revisit the dividend policy at the February Board Meeting later this month.","In 2017, we expect AFFO per share growth to much more closely match FFO per share growth. None of these assumptions underline our 2017 guidance have changed since we provided our initial outlook just over a month ago. And we are reiterating guidance for 2017.","Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 12. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $108 million of mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of a little over 6%. We now have just $3 million of secured debt remaining or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. Subsequent to year-end, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January. Our 6.625% Series F of Preferred Stock is callable in April and we expect to fund the $182.5 million redemption by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares, subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May.","Aside from the remainder of the forward equity offering and barring any unforeseen acquisition activity, our plan does not contemplate any additional common equity issuance in 2017. Even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA will remain below five times throughout the entire year. We also expect to capitalize on the current strength of the data center investment sales market by continuing to prune our portfolio and selling up to another $200 million of assets this year. In addition, we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends. Finally, we expect to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed rate financing later this year.","As you can see from the bubbles in the map on page 13, we have the most foreign currency exposure to the British pound. Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to further our FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling denominated debt later this year. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we've also mitigated interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing.","Over the course of the year, we brought our floating rate debt exposure down by more than a half to a little less than 10% of total debt outstanding at year-end, as shown in the pie charts on the right side of page 14. On the left side of the page 14, it appears that we have \u2013 it is apparent that we've also cleared the runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall thereafter. Finally, we reduced leverage from 5.2 times at the end of 2015 to 4.8 times at the end of 2016. Our balance sheet is primed for growth consistent with our long-term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, Mr. Power. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So, my first question is on M&A and if you could comment on the remaining milestones as you integrate the new European assets and as well the kind of the many potential that you see in enhancing interconnection revenues there? And then if you could also maybe talk about your views on further inorganic growth in Europe or elsewhere? There has obviously been a lot of recent M&A transactions where you did not participate. And then I've got a follow-up. Thank you.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah, Jonathan. Hi, Scott here. I think Andy touched on a couple of those items here, but I'll just go over them again. We're off to a great start with the EMEA portfolio that we acquired. We're on track with our underwriting there. The overall EMEA team has been fully integrated under the Digital Realty umbrella and that was finalized in the fourth quarter, so that's going well.","In 2017, we will focus on integration of systems and processes. Over there, we are migrating the Amsterdam one connectivity ecosystems over to Science Park tower. And we have our colo expansion plans into new locations in the European market, are underway. We're seeing good customer activity and we're cross-selling products and I think all that bodes well for revenue synergies.","On the cross-connect, so I think it's reasonable to view the growth there is going to be a little more modest than it would be by U.S. standards. The European market is structurally different as it relate to that. So, I think that you temper the expectations there. I think it's more common to see kind of 5% to 10% of revenues coming out of cross-connects in these European assets.","On further inorganic M&A, as we always say, we look at everything. We're looking for opportunities that are strategic and complementary, that we can prudently finance and represent a good investment value for our shareholders. And by that we mean accretive. I think as a general statement that I can say that we are not looking to acquire assets just to get bigger. And many of the opportunities that were out there presented \u2013 really had neither a strategic value nor represented good value until it's easy for us to be interested observers on those. But I think we're going to remain disciplined in our approach to this. And we're not going to jump on any opportunities that will really only serve to make us bigger and not better.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, maybe switching gears for Dan Papes. I wondered if you could maybe summarize how you see your priorities over the coming quarters now that you've been onboard for a few months. Thanks.","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Jon. Jon, it's been a very busy three months for me since joining Digital Realty. And we've gotten a lot done and it will inform my priorities just to tell you the things that we've been focusing on in those three months. Very pleased to see the level of talent that we have across the organization. I've also brought some new people in as well and have a few more coming. So we'll strengthen our team even more. We've also taken that talent from three entities, really, and turned it into one. We had Telx skills and Digital skills and Telecity skills and we've taken the best of all of them and turned that into one global sales organization.","So, in the coming quarters we'll leverage that to generate some meaningful growth for the business. We really are now one global team and we're taking our portfolio to market that way. We actually just had a successful kickoff last week of the integrated team. And I'm very pleased with how quickly our team has jelled. We also have reorganized our go-to-market organization around our customers and our markets. And are now going to market in the form of verticals that specialize in the unique ways that each of those vertical customers buy. We're providing solutions to them. We're not going to market by geography or by products. We're trying to help our customers meet new opportunities and solve challenges that they have in their businesses.","Another major priority for me, Bill mentioned it several times in his opening statements, is Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances. We believe that there is meaningful upside for us in that business. And so we're going to put a special emphasis on that, and invest significantly from a go-to-market perspective in that space. It allows us to reach many new customers that we might not otherwise have been able to reach and it allows us to do that at a much lower cost of sales. And so, we see the opportunity to generate benefits for ourselves, for our partner \u2013 those who partner with us, as well as our customers in the end. So, all of this, we believe \u2013 as we focus on it in the coming quarters, will be good for our business and it will position us to capitalize on our comprehensive platform to generate future growth.","Operator","And the next question will come Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to follow-up Dan, if I could on the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances emphasis that you're going to have. And just to ask you if there is some kind of metric by which we can sort of track you or benchmark you, where we could start to understand the opportunity in the Partnerships (sic) [Partners] and Alliances area?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yes. So, what I can \u2013 as we develop the program, we can probably give you more specific metrics. We are just launching the new emphasized approach to it. We've already seen good results, as you saw from the Direct Link Colo, as we talked about the deal with IBM on Direct Link Colo, which actually generated about $3 million in TCV last year, but giving you a comprehensive set of financial targets and number of partners around that will be something I think we'll be able to give you in the coming quarter.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I think...","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And, Jordan, just to add on there, just chime-in for one second.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And, I think we had \u2013 to be fair, we've had some successful partners in the last quarter, new partner that landed a fairly sizable deal with us in North America, supporting a publicly-listed healthcare company. I think one of the financial elements I think you'll see, and be it \u2013 Dan's been here for three months, so don't count on it tomorrow. But an acceleration of sales and revenue on the back \u2013 without a commensurate acceleration of sales head count is a way to financially see our results for the partners and channels kind of bearing fruit.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. Thanks, Andy. The other question I had was, I guess, Andy, you talked about IX growing at a faster rate in 2017, I thought maybe you could expand on that?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So we \u2013 on a year-over-year basis, we've \u2013 our interconnection revenue, it's grown more than double \u2013 just more than double-digit, just because we've added some incremental capacity. But on just a pure same-store basis it's kind of low-teens, outpacing the pure colocation growth. And, well, I would say kind of part and parcel with our expanding the footprint and the opportunities for additional colocation, interconnection opportunities. We expect a modest pickup in that growth, in the revenue on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. You mentioned in your comments about the balance sheet and the leverage coming down to 4.8 times. As you look into the possibility of rates being where they are or higher, how does that affect the target leverage that you want to achieve over the next few years and how you're looking at the balance sheet funding development?","And then just secondly on the point of development, I think your guidance flagged about $800 million to a $1 billion of development for 2017. The construction in progress that's left to go later on in the disclosures is, I think a little over $600 million. And I'm curious if you could talk a bit more about bridging those two and the types of opportunities that you might be looking at? Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Mike, I'll take \u2013 try to take both of those. So, on the balance sheet standpoint, we have a financial strategy of kind of having a balance sheet that's positioned for growth; and we kind of first and foremost target a leverage metric around 5-ish times debt to EBITDA. Now it's gotten \u2013 in the past it's been a little bit higher than that, probably up to 5.5 times. Today, we stand kind of a little below that, roughly 4.8 times. We philosophically think for our business mix and being an active developer, that's the right way to run the capitalization of the company.","We are also hopeful though of obviously a rising rate environment finally coming to bear. And the way we try to think about protecting against that is one, minimizing our floating rate debt as much as possible. So today we stand, I believe 10% of our debt is floating rate, which is primarily borrowings outstanding under our revolver and that's been literally cut in half over the last year. And two, mitigating our maturity risk, so kind of matching the duration of our cash flows and our assets with long-term fixed rate debt financing. So if you look at our debt maturity schedule, you won't see much of any debt covenant due before 2020. And then thereafter we try to stagger the bars, so that we're not kind of putting any risk on the balance sheet. And those things hold for me as the CFO in a rising rate environment or quite frankly in many different rate environments.","Going to your second question, the CapEx spend, the CapEx implied by the guidance at the end of the year relative to where we came out. Quite honestly, probably we're trending sub to the midpoint of that guidance going into the end of the year. It's really a product of timing. We \u2013 some projects slipped over into 2017, let's call it maybe a $100 million of that spend is kind of a calendar year slip. We are still seeing that even with that we did have a marked increase in CapEx year-over-year spent from 2015 to 2016 and our 2016 to 2017 midpoint does imply another increase. I think that's a product of two things. We've had a fair bit of success on the scale side of the business, building our campuses, expanding our customer footprint and helping them grow to the various buildings we have on other campuses. And 2017 and onto 2018 is going to have two new more demonstrative markets that they really had no contribution in prior years with Frankfurt, Germany in Europe and Osaka, Japan in Asia.","Operator","And the next question will come from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Thanks. Hi, guys. I was hoping we could touch on Brexit and just I'm wondering if you're seeing any clarity in terms of how tenants are starting to think about managing that.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hi Lukas, it's Bill. We \u2013 post Brexit, we actually signed a fair number of deals in London, while before Brexit we hadn't done much business at all. So I think, from that standpoint, Brexit perhaps has been good for the London market. But having said that we are building in Frankfurt and Amsterdam, and we're definitely seeing demand in both of those markets as well.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, LLC","Great. And then, also could we just touch on real quickly the integration costs, is that all of the European portfolio, is some of that Telx and then just how are those integration costs tracking relative to your initial expectations?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. This quarter the integration costs are more heavily weighted towards the European portfolio. Quite frankly, a large chunk of it is \u2013 we hired a consultant firm to kind of help us through the integration process. So we have outside third-party advisors, with that domain expertise across all the multiple functions that touch the combined company. So a large of that is paying consultants to kind of help us facilitate that integration. There maybe a little bit on the Telx side on that, but I would say that's not a larger or a material amount to spend. And in terms of tracking, we've always set budgets at the time of the acquisition and then refresh moving into our 2017 spend. I'd say we're tracking slightly below budget, but overall these are not massive dollar spends in any regards in terms of integration. I think especially as it relates to the European portfolio, where it was really an absorption of their team without tremendous overlap given their colocation interconnection expertise and our scale expertise. So, it's not a huge dollar integration bucket to begin with.","Operator","The next question will be from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Two questions, if I may. When I look at your bookings in 2015 versus 2016, excluding interconnect, they're roughly flat at about $127 million. And as the company has gotten bigger, when you look at what you're targeting in terms of growth expectations, what is the new reset on where bookings should be? I appreciate that there is a $33 million this quarter and I appreciate that they will be lumpy, but when we look in 2017, can you give us any color in terms of what you consider to be \u2013 what you consider to be hitting your bookings target? Also as it relates to the dividend, I appreciate that the board is going to be meeting later this month to go over that. But can you talk about the AFFO payout ratio in terms of where you'd be comfortable with that and ultimately where you can potentially go? It seems like there's potentially an opportunity here to increase the dividend at a greater rate in 2017 than we saw last year. Thanks.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Maybe I'll touch on the dividend first. So on the dividend, obviously, as you know, it is ultimately in the board's hands and management will make a recommendation to the board to accept or approve. But as you've seen from the growth in our cash flow and our AFFO, and where our payoff stands today, I think there is a fairly decent chance that the dividend increase will accelerate or be greater than the prior year's dividend increase. While \u2013 with the one caveat being this, Colby, that while we're not the developer, I do view retaining capital as an attractive source versus going out to the market. So every dollar I can retain and redeploy into our active development pipeline that we develop to 10 to 12 returns is an accretive use of that capital. So I don't think you'll see our payout ratio move wildly. At the same time, I do think the dividend is going to increase a little bit more this year than last year.","When I talk about signings, I mean, we have internal numbers where we have really market-by-market based on what we see the pipeline demand, and how that lines up with our available supply and our timing of bringing new supply coming onboard. We obviously did not give you that \u2013 a line item for that in our table, in our guidance, although we do give a fairly robust disclosure. It's something that's a little bit subjective, because as you move through the year, different markets heat up and different markets cool down, and different lines of our business be it scale or colo kind of move in the same degree. So, we're interested in focusing on winning demand at attractive rates to generate profitable returns on our capital.","My goal was more and more every quarter, the best I \u2013 the most I can. I don't think we have like a specific internal goal we want to share, as in terms of a leasing volume number here on this call.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","I'm trying to \u2013 I guess what I'm trying to do is, you guys I think are targeting mid-to-high-single digits FFO per share growth each year. And at this juncture, with the company the size that it is now, I guess I am trying to just triangulate back to \u2013 what we need to see from a bookings perspective over \u2013 again, not on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I appreciate that lumpiness, but on an aggregate year basis, what that might be, but I guess that's something we'll have to try and look at it a little bit more.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Listen, Colby, what I would say is, listen, we've just finished the fourth quarter. Some of the fourth quarter signs obviously have implications on the rest of how 2017 goes. We're halfway through the first quarter. And right here on this call we're reiterating our guidance that we gave you on January 3. So based on everything we've signed in 4Q, based on everything we know we signed so far in 1Q, we think we're on a signings momentum or velocity that's going to generate that FFO growth you just mentioned.","Operator","The next question will come from Richard Choe of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan","Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit. In terms of colocation and interconnection it seems like signings have been very steady and that has pretty good visibility. The Turn-Key Flex seems to be a lot more volatile. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the pipeline, kind of, longer-term that maybe makes you feel better about potential signings in the future in that section?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Richard. I'd say the pipeline looks pretty good. To give you a data point, our investment committee used to meet every other week. Now we meet every week. Same amount of time in those meetings and that's really to discuss the deals that are in front of us. So, it's a good pipeline. There is no question about that. Dan, I don't know if you have anything you'd like to add?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","No. I would just reiterate. It's a good pipeline and we're awfully busy getting those proposals out the door.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","But I will say too, Richard, that there is no question that on average the scale deals are higher. There was a...","Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan","And then you said that they're getting more complicated and lumpy, but that doesn't mean that they are dying down at all. It's just taking longer to kind of get through these deals.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","No, no, but they're bigger. On average they're bigger.","Richard Y. Choe - \u200eJ.P. Morgan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to touch base on the Dallas market. There's been a lot of press about that market being particularly strong or expected to be particularly strong this year. Just curious if you could share your thoughts on that market from what you're seeing both on demand and the supply side.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Vin. This is Andy. I'm pretty sure you're referring to an article that described Dallas as 2016 Chicago. I would say a little bit different dynamic there. It feels like there's more competitors. There's more competitors with supply. At the same time, we've had some pretty good traction recently in terms of signings in that market and pipeline of additional deals in that market. But I have not seen anything that necessarily unlock the flood gate in Dallas. And you can just pull up public disclosure you'll notice that it does have a fairly wide competitive set that we're competing within that market.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Okay. And next question is really going back to the same capital side of things. I mean that there has been some slowing trends there for the last few quarters, I think ended up at the low-end of the guidance range for 2016. But just curious if you could just comment on what is sort of driving that deceleration outside of FX, obviously. And then, maybe talk about the changes in the same-store pool now with Telx being in there. How that changes the comparisons year-over-year?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So I think that the thing you didn't mention, which is a little bit of anomaly is that the fourth quarter had a 1.4% constant currency growth quarter-over-quarter. I would say it's probably another 100 basis point higher than that due to some anomalies around some tax assessment or refunds I should say that we received in the prior year, which makes for a tough comp. And we did receive some impact from that PBB lease we took back and obviously are re-leasing right now. So it's probably 100 basis points higher than the 1.4% on a constant currency basis.","On a full year basis, I think, we're towards the higher end of our initial guidance at 2.7% as reported and 3.6% constant currency, so fairly happy with that. I would say it was a smaller pull this year because we tried to be intellectually honest with how we treated Telx in that analysis. Moving to 2017, I'd say the biggest impact will be including the Telx contribution, will be the pooling that's a lot more meaningful and the larger component of our company. So it will give you a better read through as to same capital look for all more of digital than it did during 2016.","Operator","And the next question will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. When you look out at the various markets that \u2013 where you're operating, are you seeing any sort of rational behavior either in pricing or market entry? What is that looking like? And then, now what areas can we expect you to emphasize going forward, both sort of inorganic and an organic growth? You have various types of assets. What should we expect you to put most of the emphasis on going forward?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Frank. On the market question, I mean, first of all, New Jersey continues to be our weakest market. I wouldn't say that there is irrational pricing there. There just is weak demand. I think where you find potentially irrational pricing is when there is a significantly sized deal, a very large deal that you'll find people that \u2013 who price very competitively for those. What was your second question?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","The areas to emphasize organic and inorganic growth. And I think \u2013 Frank, I think I touched on a little bit too is, we're still focused on opportunities that are strategic to our business and also represent a good investment value for our shareholders and not focus on things that are just going to make as bigger. So, good examples of those are some of the opportunities out there have been just a collection of assets. And they've been very fully priced. And, frankly, I'm kind of surprised that how full the pricing has been in the market given the supply of assets that have been up there for sale. And I think that's a testimony to the strong investor appetite for our data center assets.","But we do try to focus on the more strategic ones. Anything that's just a collection of assets of two, three, four, just pure data center assets that are fully priced relative to our cost of capital aren't particularly attractive because all it does is let us get bigger and it increases the denominator and dilutes our future growth. So, we don't find those particularly exciting because we can develop those on our own. So, again, we will focus on opportunities that we believe are strategic and we can generate some synergies out of and also are attractively priced relative to our cost of capital and represent an accretive transaction as well as something that we can prudently finance. So, we're going to stick to our discipline going forward as we have in the past. And I hope it continues to play out for us the way it always has.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you. Yeah. I just kind of have one question. Looking at the re-leasing spreads on your Turn-Key Flex portfolio, still positive, they were good this quarter. I'm curious what year those leases were initially signed and one thing that I want to get at is, I know about four years ago 2013 was when rents really took a dip and I'm wondering when we're going to start to renew those leases and if we should expect re-leasing \u2013 when we should start to expect to re-leasing spread kind of ramp up as those rents what I presume are below where current market was \u2013 were leased and when they renew?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Jon, this is Andy. So, I don't have a pinpoint on the actual year for those leases. I would say they both probably go back call it 5 to 10 years. I don't think \u2013 I mean, as you look through our Turn-Key, which is predominantly larger footprint, longer-term leases, they almost all have some type of annual escalation of call it 2%, 2.5%, 3% over that duration, be it 7 or 10 years. So they've been increasing for many years now.","We have not gone to a point where we've had massive spiky uplifts upon the cash mark-to-markets. I think that's a product of being on the scale customer, they're bigger deals, they've had escalations for a longer time period and I don't think we've gotten to the expiration or the extension time for really trough rates yet at least.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Do you have any sense about \u2013 you're saying \u2013 so essentially I should take 2013, add 5 to 10 years, so we're still two or three years away from really seeing that, those rents roll.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","It feels like it, but I would say that the payments are little bit \u2013 the customers will very often come, they want to come and do a long-term extension well before their actual contractual extension. So there is potential for customers to come early to do renewals, but it does feel like what you're looking for maybe a couple of more years out there.","Operator","The next question will be from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just revisiting the revenue guidance. I guess there is a, about a 5% delta there in the range, about a $100 million. I'm just curious what would you say the key variables are in terms of execution or may be just the market environment that \u2013 to get you to the high end of the revenue guide this year?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure, Matt. I would \u2013 I mean, I would say the key variables on that range are one of execution rate and it's probably more on the scale side execution and then the colocation interconnection side in our \u2013 performance just given the mix of our business, and the stacks of the size of the deals on the scale side, can be \u2013 tend to be a lot larger and bigger impactors. And the other thing, I would say, FX, I believe, could have another impact there. And going back several years, you probably wouldn't have heard us talk about this much, but we're living in an environment where the pounds drop from a $1.45 to $1.20, and we have a large piece of our business in the UK, that obviously has a \u2013 can create a large headwind to our top line growth. Now, as I mentioned, we hedged that having, new \u2013 to couple sterling bond offerings north of $1 billion dollars, there's multi-currency revolver and term loan so that headwind doesn't 100% flow through to our bottom line, but it would \u2013 can put some variability into the top line growth.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then one follow-up on the development pipeline. It looks like you had a couple of fully leased projects slip out of there, but pretty good increase on a sequential basis, and I think it's higher here than I've seen in quite a while. I guess \u2013 what's your sort of line of sight into having that pool substantially leased up by the time those assets are released into the stabilized pool?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So, the deliveries you mentioned \u2013 sorry, go ahead, Matt.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess by the time they're delivered?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So, the deliveries you mentioned that came out of the pool on the scale side I believe were 88% leased. So, they're almost 90% leased by the time we actually finished the construction of the building. We have a slide in the deck that kind of highlights our three North America core active development markets that did 10 to 15 megawatts per month in the last 12 months of deliveries and those are all kind of 88 to 94 or so percent leased upon the time we opened up.","You are correct, the active development pipeline has increased a fair bit. I think it's a roughly $250-ish million versus the prior quarter in terms of total projects. That includes some of those \u2013 I mean obviously we've been increasing with our global footprint expanding in Europe and Asia. Some colo projects which are a little smaller dollars have been added to the list. Those typically obviously did not have much preleasing before they open up.","I think we feel pretty confident on bringing those on in time at attractive cost to us and be able to lease a significant share up by the time we open the doors. Many of those projects actually are like the last buildings on some of our major campuses, be it the K building or H building down in Ashburn before we move on to the next parcel of land; or the 9377 building in Chicago. So, we're kind of rounding out some of our large campuses and now having to move to the next door property for our next phase of growth. And in that case, that's often customers that have already been in our building, wanting to really stack up that last piece of inventory so that their engineers don't even have to cross the road even though it's a short distance.","So, I think we feel pretty good about that. At the same time, if you would stop all the \u2013 stop the music and everyone has to find a chair, I think our committed spend on that pipeline, meaning the spend we have to spend or would be in default on is about $190 million. So, it's 0.2, 3.3 turns of EBITDA and we can easily address it with our revolver that's got $200 million outstanding.","Operator","And the next question will be from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Curious regarding the scale funnel, it sounds like the deals are bigger you said. So, should we expect, is it safe to assume more scale deals from DLR in 2017 versus 2016?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I certainly hope so. I mean \u2013 kidding aside, I mean we wouldn't increase the active development pipeline by that size and we won't be moving on to build at the adjacent campuses if we didn't have conviction on the pipeline. Now, they're not a done deal, obviously there's only a certain amount that's pre-leased today and we're only a month-and-a-half into the year, but that's certainly the goal. I don't know if Dan you want to add anything to that?","Daniel W. Papes - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is we do see a strong pipeline in the CSP and hyperscale space and it's not just domestic. I think it's important to point out that our global footprint is very appealing to the hyperscale customers. And as we expand our footprint in Asia and in Europe, we're seeing good strong demand for those sites as well.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And Jordan, some of the changes we're making on the sales team, we expect will allow us to gain deeper penetration into the customer and thus will unearth additional opportunities with these major players.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, a little bit of a follow-up for maybe Scott or Andy, you could tag team. This is sort of strategically year-over-year plus into the \u2013 even more so now into the Telx acquisition and integration and living with it. And so I'm kind of curious on your view of colo and interconnection relative to scale and basically where you see the best risk-adjusted returns for your money?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","You want me to start or you want to go?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Go ahead, I'll hang on.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So maybe I'll just touch on Telx holistically and kind of a year-end checkup kind of thing and then I'll let Scott talk to kind of risk adjusted returns, whether \u2013 from an investment kind of hat. I mean, obviously, Jordan, or maybe not obviously, I think we're pretty proud of what I call successful acquisition financing and more \u2013 most of the integration. I mean, we've navigated a substantial re-org that generates significant expense synergies. We either met or exceeded our underwriting targets, we've unified the team under one Digital Realty brand and we also leveraged some new found expertise and adopted market-leading customer portal. And then, on the new future, I think, we're generating revenue synergies with the footprint expansion to markets like Ashburn, Richardson and also just growing the footprint some of our gateways be it Chicago or LA or Phoenix. So, all-in-all I think we're on track. And I think it's been a fruitful, I mean, a good overall experience. And I think we're building momentum that's going to bear fruit into 2017 and beyond.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","And Jordon on the risk reward spectrum of it, it's really \u2013 it's kind of interesting. So, the way I look at it, it's a little bit of a toss-up. You could generate better operating margins on the colo side, be it shorter contract terms, you have smaller customers, typically more diversified customer bases. But then, you also have limits of how big it can be, and we can take some of these markets. Northern Virginia is a great example, 2 megawatts of leasing and \u2013 of colo in Northern Virginia is a big year for any company. And 2 megawatts is kind of the first week of January for scale.","So, it's a tough call. I think really at the end of the day, what our view on this is, is you want to have both. We want to have a full spectrum platform to offer space and power and connectivity to a customer, whether you want a cabinet or you want a 100 megawatts. And we want to do that on a global scale, because what we see the customers wanting from us right now is they have \u2013 they have a lot of different needs over a lot of different markets, and a lot of different types and needs. So, they might need a colo deployment in one market, they might need scale in one, hyperscale in another. And they want to be able to come to a single vendor for that to partner with and provide them with some consistency of delivery across the globe. And we know, we're the only ones right now that are even close to be able to do that on a global scale. And we think we're seeing a good chance to being the only ones. And so, it's kind of hard to really separate, I mean because they are both very important.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for 2016, as outlined here on the last page. We had another very good year characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan.","We met or exceeded our Telx underwriting targets and we continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We continue to enhance our product offerings with the launch of Service Exchange, the expansion of our Partners and Alliances program and the expansion of our global footprint to 11 new facilities across eight new and existing markets.","We raised guidance three times over the course of the year delivering core FFO per share growth above the high-end of our original guidance range, and we delivered outsized growth in AFFO per share.","Finally, we achieved this growth while strengthening our balance sheet. We paid down virtually all of our remaining secured debt. We reduced our floating rate debt exposure by more than half, and we lowered leverage by nearly half a turn.","Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to say congratulations and thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in early March.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Stein. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Due to scheduling constraints, today's call will be limited to 1 hour. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Stewart","Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call will be CEO Bill Stein and CFO Andy Power. The call may contain forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. ","For a further discussion of risks related to our business see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. ","Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our full year 2018 results. First, we delivered record bookings over one-third better than the previous all-time high. Next, we closed on the acquisition of Ascenty, expanding our global platform into Latin America and we further extended our sustainability leadership with continued expansion of our renewable energy capacity. ","Third, we delivered 8% core FFO per share growth and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share for the third time in the past four years. Last but not least, we further strengthen the balance sheet by recasting our line of credit and locking in long-term fixed rate debt at attractive coupons.","With that I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","William Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. Our formula for long-term value creation is a global connected sustainable framework. We advanced each of these three pillars during the fourth quarter. We extended our global footprint with our entry into Latin America. In December, we closed the acquisition of Ascenty, the leading data center platform in the rapidly growing Brazilian market shown here on page three of our presentation.","Ascenty owns a high quality portfolio of purpose built world class data centers as well as a proprietary fiber network and is run by a best in class management team. Over 90% of the revenue is generated from investment grade or equivalent customers and over 75% of contractual cash rent is denominated in U.S. dollars. This transaction represents a highly strategic extension of our global platform offers a compelling growth opportunity and will be accretive to our long-term growth.","Our top priority is deepening connections with our customers. We are also focused on strengthening connections across our organization. We made several important investments in our human capital during the fourth quarter most notably including the appointment of Greg Wright as Chief Investment Officer and Corey Dyer as Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing.","Greg joins us following a long and distinguished career in investment banking. And he served as lead advisor on several transformational transactions for Digital Realty. Corey brings over 25 years of relevant industry experience, including colocation and interconnection sales leadership experience successfully targeting the enterprise customer segment. With these key additions in place we have filled out the team and are fully primed to press our competitive advantages and power our customers\u2019 digital ambitions around the world.","We also took several significant steps towards further extending our sustainability leadership over the past few months highlighted here on page four. In November, we received NAREIT\u2019s data center Leader in the Light Award for the second consecutive year. We are the first and so far the only data center REIT to receive NAREITs leader in the light award for sustainable real estate practices.","In December, we announced that we earned the U.S. EPA\u2019s Energy Star certification for superior energy performance in 24 data centers in 2018. We also entered in an agreement with Salt River Project to source solar energy to power a portion of the load for our Arizona data center portfolio. In January we issued the first ever data center in Green Euro bond.","And finally, just a couple of weeks ago we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. We are committed to managing our environmental impact in optimizing our use of energy and natural resources because we believe it's the right thing to do and because it matters to our customers. ","Most of our top customers have 100% renewable energy targets and our ability to meet their needs for renewable and highly efficient data center solution sets us apart from our competitors.","Let's turn to market fundamentals on page five. Moving from East to West with the sun data center demand remains robust across the Asia Pacific region, driven by local as well as global hyper scale users. In Japan, we recently announced a multi-megawatt multi-year agreement with a leading global cloud service provider to anchor the latest facility on our Osaka Connected campus scheduled for delivery the middle of this year.","As you can see from the occupancy schedule in our supplemental we've also had significant activity in Singapore where we are quickly running out of capacity and recently announced the acquisition of a land parcel on a long-term ground lease to accommodate build out of our next facility at Liang drive on the east side of Singapore, scheduled for delivery the latter half of next year. The supply situation across the region remains largely in check. And given the robust demand backdrop, we expect to continue to invest to support our customers\u2019 growth in existing core markets as well as potentially in select new markets.","In Europe, supply demand dynamics are fairly balanced. Despite the noise around Brexit, we continue to see healthy demand, notably including a sizable global cloud network node deployment in our Crawley Campus in London during the fourth quarter. At Sovereign House in the Docklands we are nearing capacity. And we recently gave the go ahead to break ground on a Cloud House, an adjacent multi-megawatt facility that will offer customers a unique ability to land a new colocation deployment directly adjacent to the city's network dense interconnection hub.","Incidentally, we acquired the freehold interest in Sovereign House during the fourth quarter and we now own this iconic London Docklands asset outright. Across the UK as well as the Continent, pricing is competitive and customers remain focused on flexibility and expansion options along with differentiated connectivity solutions and a track record of operational excellence.","Market vacancy remains in check across the major European markets, while competitors are bringing new supply to market it is being met by healthy demand, particularly from existing customers either expanding their current footprint or looking for new partnerships for their next phase of growth.","In the Americas, competition is similarly intense across the primary data center metros, including Northern Virginia, which is by far the largest and most active Metro in the world. Despite the number of competitors and shovels in the ground, we are well positioned to outperform the competition, given our ability to address the full spectrum of our customers data center needs around the world, our deep installed customer base in Ashburn with a strong preference to expand next to their existing deployments. The longest runway for customers\u2019 campus growth align with our agile delivery capabilities allowing for limited speculative risk.","And last but certainly not least, the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. At the end of the day, we believe customers view our global platform, our operational and financial resiliency and our comprehensive space power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider.","Let's turn to the macro environment on page six, we are late in the cycle and comps are getting tougher across corporate America. Tough comps and moderating growth are a far cry from a global recession however, as evidenced by continued robust job growth in the U.S. as well as the very respectable growth in cloud revenues during the fourth quarter.","Hyperscale requirements are big and getting bigger so new business could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But we continue to see very healthy demand from our customers. The trends underlying this demand are long-term and secular in nature. People don't stop using personal or professional social media just because it's late in the cycle. In fact, corporate IT outsourcing and cloud adoption are significant drivers of our business. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs. During a slowdown, cost containment and achieving efficiencies become paramount.","Constantly given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are very well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power ","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on page eight. During the fourth quarter, we signed total bookings of $44 million, including a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $37 million, with a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years, including a $10 million colocation contribution. These results do not include an additional $18 million of previously disclosed bookings by the Ascenty during the fourth quarter. ","Ascenty did not sign any deals during the last 10 days of the year after closing, but this volume of activity, particularly relative the size of the base should give you a good idea of why we are so excited about the growth potential for this platform.","Our largest single deal during the fourth quarter was just 6 megawatts, and nearly 40% of our activity was outside of the U.S. Our domestic fourth quarter bookings were likewise diverse, with major contributors from the Bay Area, Houston, Dallas and Chicago markets.","For the full year, we delivered total bookings of $268 million an all-time high and up 35% from the previous record of $199 million in the prior year. Colocation and interconnection bookings were flat year-over-year at $63 million, but third and fourth quarter results were both above the recent average.","We continue to see the traction with accounts expanding with us globally, including a leading regional cloud provider, who expanded their footprint with us most recently in Singapore in the fourth quarter. We've helped this customer expand globally in the U.S., Europe and in Asia Pacific within the last 12 months.","Another example is a global leading SaaS provider that we helped to expand into Japan through our Mitsubishi Corporation Digital Realty joint venture. Digital Realty is assisting this strategic partner in expanding their cloud presence in the region. They are in multiple sites across our global platform and this is their third deployment with us across APAC. One final example, I want to site illustrates our ability to help hyperscale our customers power their digital ambitions.","One of the world's largest SaaS companies required a custom built data center. We signed the deal in Q1 and they commenced using the data center in Q4. Simply put, we were able to build and launch the first data haul for the customer within nine months. We're also pleased with our traction in the Enterprise segment. We are landing business from small, medium and large customers, who are positioned to grow with us. We added a total of more than 150 logos in 2018, more than half of which were enterprise customers and we signed a total of 868 contracts in 2018.","Aarki rank the 19th fastest growing company in North America and number four in the Bay Area on 2018 Technology Fast 500 helps companies grow and re-engage their mobile users. Aarki is standardizing their global data center footprint with Digital Realty to ensure they have the scalable solutions around the world to meet their fast paced timelines, and support end user demand. Most recent colocation expansions were made across Ashburn and Amsterdam.","Dialpad, who designed and developed cloud based platforms for enterprise communications is hosting their AI powered Cloud Phone System in Digital Realty Dallas and New York locations. We help build redundancy within the platform for our customer's end users. Dispatch Track, the number one last mile logistics platform that is currently being used by about 40% of all furniture and appliance deliveries that occur in the Continental United States has a unique requirement of owning its computer infrastructure with specialized hardware for its proprietary algorithms. After quite a bit of research Dispatch Track chose Digital Realty as a partner on this journey.","Digital Realty\u2019s world class infrastructure, commitment to standards in terms of certifications and processes presence across wide geographic locations will help Dispatch Track scale their solution and service their current and future customers better.","Dispatch track is looking forward to consolidating and scaling all of their existing hosted infrastructure at Digital Realty. We continue to see very healthy networks sector business. This quarter a noble win was without scale a strategic partner of Dassault Syst\u00e8mes at the forefront of cloud computing. ","Out Scale\u2019s primary focus is providing infrastructure services, hosted solutions and on premise private cloud as well as related to cloud based service like mapper as a service, rendering solutions, compute, storage and networking to many of the world's most respected companies.","This new and much larger private cage environment for a longtime customer will enable Out Scale to grow and remain focused on their core competencies of providing secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service solutions to over 800 of the world's top corporate customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia.","We continue to see traction with our service exchange platform. Net gain, who helps highly regulated industries such as healthcare, financial and legal services manage their IT infrastructure needed to shorten connection provisions in time and minimize latency between net gain facilities. ","We provide a centralized colocation facility for their hybrid cloud architecture to connect to local customers. They were able to connect to major telecom providers to maintain 10 millisecond or less latency between facilities leveraging service exchange for fast, secure access to Azure cloud services and provide a high availability environment for customer application hosting.","Total alliance and channel partners related bookings continue to contribute to our business. And our channel partners sourced nearly 20% of new logos in 2018 and over 25% of new logos during the fourth quarter. Through our channel partner, we landed a Korean IT based marketing and advertising company with a mission to support bringing Korean lifestyle fashion and entertainment imports in our LA data center to support its digital advertising and cloud business. ","They chose Digital Realty because they needed the right location with maximum uptime to support their mission critical infrastructure, flexibility to support their private and hybrid cloud environments, access to data center and cloud connectivity and certification compliance.","Our continued partnership and capabilities with IBM around their Direct Link products resulted in more than a 200% year-over-year increase from our total deployments in 2017 and we are working on several opportunities for 2019. Significant 2018 deployments with IBM included adding new IBM block chain and IBM hyper protect deployments allowing IBM customers to deploy their infrastructure and leverage secure, direct low latency access to IBM cloud and these advanced services all within a highly connected ecosystem supported by -- globally by Digital Realty. ","Turning to our backlog on page nine. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stepped down from the all-time high at the end of the third quarter to $97 million as of year-end, due to an all-time high level commencements during the fourth quarter. The weighted average lag between fourth quarter signings and commencements was a little over three months speaking to the diversity of our fourth quarter signings activity.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed $138 million of renewals during the fourth quarter in addition to new leases signed. The weighted average lease term on renewals was five years and cash was rents rolled down 2.6%. For the full year, cash rents rolled up 0.3% a bit better than our slightly negative guidance. ","Cash re-leasing spreads were negative for Turnkey as well as colo renewals in the fourth quarter. The colo roll down was entirely due to two top customers who started out in a colo environment early in their life cycle and have grown so significantly that they are both now hyperscaler users.","Our unique product offering with the ability to accommodate single rack colocation and interconnection footprint since all the way up to multi megawatt hyperscale requirements enables us to continue to support the full spectrum of data center solutions for both of these strategic customers. ","The turnkey roll down was largely due to the expiration in Houston where a customer renewed their existing footprint on a long-term lease, while simultaneously expanding and taking close to another megawatt of additional capacity likewise, on a long-term lease. This transaction is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic long-term approach to customer relationship management.","As you're probably aware, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will be negative in the high-single digits in 2019, primarily due to size of above market expirations within the legacy DFT portfolio, this roll down was fully baked into our underwriting at the time of the acquisition. As we work away past these pending renewals, we do expect to reach an inflection point and return to positive re-leasing spreads, driven by modest market rent growth and a steady progress. We have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance overall portfolio occupancy slipped 50 basis points to 89% due to a single non-data center customer who moved out of an entire Class B office building they were using as a call center on a campus earmarked for future redevelopment in Dallas. Needless to say, the square footage impact on reporter occupancy is far more pronounced than the economic impact given the low rent for a call center redevelopment candidate in Dallas.","Property operating expenses picked up sequentially, primarily due to the timing of some repairs and maintenance projects we had expected to close out earlier in the year, along with the growth of our portfolio with more than 50 megawatts of capacity placed in service during the fourth quarter.","Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on page 11, the U.S. dollar strengthened somewhat over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 50 basis points headwind to the year-over-year growth in our fourth quarter results. We manage currency risk by issuing locally to nominate debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.","In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing. Given our strategy to matching the duration of our long lived assets with long-term fixed rate debt a 100 basis point move in LIBOR would have a 1% impact to our full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed.","In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up approximately 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and the full year. We were a couple of pennies above consensus for the fourth quarter and we came at the at the top end of our original guidance range for the full year. We also deliver double-digit AFFO per share growth for the third time in the past four years.","As you may have seen from the press release, we are reiterating the 2019 guidance we rolled a few weeks ago. Almost all the drivers are unchanged except for debt financing. As you may know, just two days after we gave our initial 2019 guidelines the debt capital market seas parted across the pun and we're able to successfully tap the euro bond market for the first evergreen data center euro bond, raising approximately $1 billion of seven year paper at a 2.5% coupon.","Our 2019 refinancing the capital spending needs have been put to bed, but we expect to remain nimble for the rest of the year. And we may look to capitalize on favorable market conditions to lock in long-term fixed rate financing and attractive coupons across the currencies that support our assets to proactively manage future liabilities.","Please keep in mind that our 2019 guidance includes a $0.20 impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. We don't typically give explicit AFFO per share guidance, but given the hit to the bottom line from the change in accounting policy it's worth noting that we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in AFFO per share.","Please also keep in mind, this mid-single digit growth includes the 2% dilution from Ascenty and also absorbs a 100 to 200 basis points FX headwind. Excluding FX and accounting changes, we expect to deliver per share growth in line with our long-term sweet spot in the mid to high-single digits.","In terms of the quarterly distribution, the first half of 2019 should represent roughly 49% of the full year results. While the second half should contribute roughly 51%. In terms of the quarterly dividend that payout policy is ultimately a board level decision. Given the actual cash flow growth in 2018, along with the projected growth in 2019, we would expect to see continued growth in the per share dividend just so as we have each and every year since our IPO in 2004.","Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. It's been another busy few months for the Digital Realty capital markets team characterized by consistent execution against financing strategy on maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs. ","First and foremost in late September, we executed a forwarded equity offering to fund the Ascenty acquisition and development CapEx needs. We expect to receive approximately $1.1 billion of net proceeds when we settle the forward sale agreements. In early October, we issued approximately $520 million of 12 year sterling bonds at a 3.75% coupon.","In late October, we recast our $3.3 billion global senior unsecured credit facilities tightening pricing for the line of credit by 10 basis points, extending the maturity date another three years to 2024 and upsizing availability by $350 million. We also completed a roughly $300 million five year revolving credit facility denominated in Japanese yen define our joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation.","Shortly before year end, we closed on the Ascenty acquisition. The transaction was initially funded with $600 million of proceeds from a non-recourse five year secured term loan, $300 million of digital realty OP units and $1 billion of unsecured corporate borrowings. As you may recall, we expect to ultimately own Ascenty in a joint venture with Brookfield infrastructure, which we expect to close some time in the first quarter. ","As you can see from the charts on page 13 leverages are artificially inflated at year end, since 100% of Ascenty debt is reflected on the balance sheet. Whereas our fourth quarter results include just a 10 day contribution from Ascenty.","Pro forma for a full period contribution from Ascenty, the joint venture with Brookfield and the forward equity offering, leverage remains in line with our long-term target of approximately 5 times, while fixed charge coverage remains healthy at north of 4 times. The success of these collective financing activities over the past several months is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public, as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers enables us to prudently fund our growth.","As I mentioned a moment ago, we've already addressed our 2019 refinancing and capital spending needs, but we will continue to monitor the global debt capital markets consistent with our strategy of proactively managing the right side of our balance sheet with an eye towards longer duration financings across the currencies that support our assets. As you can see from the pro forma maturity schedule on page 15 the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity to six years, and lowered our weighted average coupon to 3.6%.","Nearly half our debt is non-U.S. dollar denominated acting as a national FX hedge for our investments outside the U.S., roughly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and over 95% of our debt is unsecured providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with less than $1 billion of maturities in any year until 2023 and no bar too tall in the out years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy. ","This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we will be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Jordan Sadler","Thank you and good afternoon. First, I'd like to see if you guys could drill down a little bit on the expectations of the pipeline as we -- and maybe level set us in terms of expectations for 2019. I know 2018 was a record year. We finished kind of on a dull note. I think a couple weeks ago you sounded a little bit optimistic at a recent conference and I'm just -- how should we be thinking about leasing volumes for 2019?","Andrew Power ","Hey thanks Jordan, this is Andy, I\u2019ll tackle that because I think you're referring to my most recent conference. Obviously we ended 2018 with what I would call very respectable quarter $44 million overall signings capping off a record year 35% year-over-year increase, which was a record -- on a record at $268 million. A lot of successes in there across regions be it in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America or markets specific and across product lines. And at the same time I think we entered 2019 with a similar amount of optimism on the overall demand backdrop.","Bill, myself, Corey, Chris and the team we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with customers in just the first handful weeks of the year we hear a lot of positive feedback of what their demand profiles look like and then how we're really lining up in terms of our footprint and capabilities to be their trusted partner around the globe.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. And so relative to 2018 you think 2018 was not necessarily an anomaly, sort of what it sounds like.","Andrew Power ","I would say listen, we sat this time in the beginning of 2018, I certainly didn\u2019t have the expectation that we're going to do 35% increase year-over-year and put record $268 million. But as we look at exiting 2018 and look at what's out in front of us in 2019 in terms of where we're seeing opportunities and we're overall honestly quite bringing on new inventory capacity such as the Osaka, Japan, Sydney Australia, our Frankfurt Hampshire and the London campuses, numerous colo footprints and then some of the usual names you've heard about North America be it Ashburn or otherwise I think we feel like we're pretty well positioned heading into this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. So kind of a related question just about overall hyperscale demand and how it benefits the data center sector. And you talked about having inventory in a lot of the key markets, but I'm wondering from a competitive standpoint how do you think about the mix of business that goes to unlisted players versus listed data center operators such as yourself. And then, maybe drill down on kind of sales given the hiring of Corey into the organization. Any kind of thoughts on channel strategy or any changes whatsoever contemplated in kind of your go to market approach. Thanks. ","William Stein","Hey, thanks, John. I guess, what I would say at least what I have observed is that the private guys win the business when at least Digital doesn\u2019t have inventory in the market. So it\u2019s a question of availability. And I do think that we are the preferred partner to most of the hyperscale players.","Andrew Power ","I\u2019d add-on for that for half a second for turning your second question, Jon. I think in addition to what we\u2019re seeing -- hearing from our customers very recently in terms of demand backdrop, I think we\u2019re also hearing a overall outlook of potential vendor consolidation where they want to do business with fewer parties over the long run really global organizations that can scale with them and meet their needs across numerous markets and product offerings, which we think we line up very well on.","In terms of changes to go to market and the like, Corey and Greg, just started with us literally the first week of January. We had already pushed up our sales kick-off we had a great kick-off that first week and our team is out of the gates here running hard for 2019. I'm sure Corey, is going to be digging in here and look at the things as ways to improve and obviously has a deep background across colocation interconnection capabilities and really penetrating the enterprise customer base an area where we're always looking to step up our game.","Jonathan Atkin","Thanks. And then quickly on, there was an interconnect announcement related to Ashburn in Chicago that you put out a couple weeks ago. And wanted to maybe get your thoughts on that overall prospects for cross Connect growth as well as your SDN partnership with Megaport? Thanks.","William Stein","No, absolutely. Thanks for the question John as always. So a couple elements to it. Yeah, the most recent announcement we just made inside of the Ashburn in Chicago markets are around expanding our internet exchange. And so, that was a lot of customer driven demand in those two markets. And because of the fact that, we have a comprehensive interconnection portfolio comprised of both the internet exchange and the service exchange, which meets a lot of our larger customer demands.","I would tell you, the reasoning and why we went into Chicago in particular is the ownership of 350 East Cermak and how that building is becoming a bellwether of the broader workloads and interconnection requirements, and then associated Ashburn, that is the epicenter of where a lot of these clouds are building out. And so getting access to all of the networks via the IX was kind of the backdrop of why we were pushed into those markets. And just further solidifying the broader architectures that not only the hyperscalers are bringing to us, but also the enterprise.","And so secondly to the partnership with Megaport, which is the underlying fabric on our service exchange. I mean, it's been a great partnership where it's really generated a lot of new revenue for us where it's -- we're having a different value based dialogue with a brand new ecosystem of enterprise customers coming in to consume cloud. And so it's an underpinning of our strategy going forward. And we've had a huge uptick in not only the dialogue, but also utilization of the platform. And so we're very happy with the outcome of that.","And again, just to echo the sentiment of Andy and having Corey join the team were just getting focus on leveraging that even further in our dialogue so that we can represent the comprehensive portfolio that we have in these markets and all the inner connection capability that we have is really a unique differentiator for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Simon Flannery","Right. Thank you very much. Good evening. I think you referenced the opportunity to go into some new markets. Could you -- you've obviously been expanding a lot in some existing markets, particularly in Asia as well recently. Can you just talk about how we should think about that in 2019, and are you likely to do that organically developing new land or do you think M&A will be the path to get to get into those markets? And any updates on a few weeks of Ascenty under your belt any learnings that you've had since they've come onboard? Thanks.","William Stein","Thanks, Simon. So I think as you know, we don't target slices of the geographic pie by region. We look to allocate capital where we see the best risk adjusted returns. We're always looking at potential markets and we want to be prepared if there are good opportunities, but our criteria just remind you is that we're customer led into major new markets and we're looking for appropriate risk adjusted returns in these new markets. I'll turn it over to Andy to handle the Ascenty question.","Andrew Power ","Simon, could you just repeat the Ascenty question, make sure I didn\u2019t miss it?","Simon Flannery","Yes, you talked about the bookings, when you came on board, but just you\u2019ve had it for six or seven weeks just how is the integration going and any more color that you've had on the opportunity since you've taken control.","Andrew Power ","Great, thank you, Simon. So we closed I think the last week before the holidays, the 21st of December. We've had our first board meeting with the team, we've -- Brookfield has cleared it's our regulatory approvals and we're working towards finalizing their closing, which should happen in the next month or so. ","We've been out in front of customers on a joint basis and have had some really terrific feedback from existing customers of legacy Digital Realty, legacy Ascenty and crossover, we've really gotten going on the rules of engagement for the Digital Realty 100 plus sales reps.","In terms of feeding demand into that region, and we're also doing some late work on the supply chain design, constructional operational capabilities to really try to bring that benefit to the Ascenty platform. Albeit it's been a fast and furious couple weeks under our ownership to-date, but so far so good and seeing some positive signs, but obviously have a lot more to report on this topic in another 90 days or so. ","Simon Flannery","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. ","Colby Synesael","Great, thank you. In your comments, prepared remarks you mentioned the renewal spreads, how they're going to be down in the high-single digits. This you should be the trough and I think you said you expect them to go back to positive in 2020 and beyond. Just tied up the pricing is it your sense that pricing is going to start to trough I mean pricing, if you look at it on a like-for-like basis seems like it's been coming down for the last few years. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you think we are because as I did notice, for example, in your returns, you're now getting to 9% to 12%, whereas you've historically guided to 10% to 12%.","And then secondly, as it relates to bookings or leasing for 2019, I appreciate you don't want to give us a hard commitment on what that number could look like. But when you think about it from a geographical dispersion perspective, is it fair to assume that we should see a notable percentage coming from international in 2019 than in 2018? Thank you.","Andrew Power ","Thanks, Colby. Let me see if I can dissect the multi-pronged of that mixture tackle at all. So a couple concepts. So first on renewal spreads, we've -- we exited the year on a full year basis cash positive just slightly and a couple points of higher than on a GAAP basis. We called out some anomalies in the actual note that happened in the fourth quarter, but happy to expand upon those specific details.","But cash positive for the full year and even greater that a gap positive we did call on our 2019 guidance released at the beginning of the year a cash negative mark-to-market really related primarily due to a large legacy customer we inherited in our acquisition of DFT. The outcome or underwriting of that event has not changed since our closing or initial acquisition. So same facts and circumstances just that timing looks like it's going to be coming fruition certainly in 2019.","And beyond that plus I'd say another larger Power Base Building or PBB renewal that likely to get completed in the first quarter of 2019. We feel that we're kind of really working our way through the bulk of the larger customer bulk renewals including early renewals pushing out their maturities for 5, 7, 10 and 15 years. When you look at the next kind of top customers that have several of renewals in those customers have, I'd say a different, different either vintage of lease, one of those customers in fact typically only sign five year leases. So has not had a 10, 15 year run of bumps in their leases and much less chance to be way out of market.","Hence our commentary, where we think the sensitive pickers moving to the pipe on here, when it comes to the expirations this year. Dovetailing to your overall -- that was renewal, so cash, upon cash upon expiration dovetailing to your question on pricing overall. If you look at our scale pricing, which I think is really more tied to that renewal comment. If we went market-by-market this quarter, I would say our scale pricing was really kind of flat to slightly up. Now, partly that is due to the overall mix in diversity of business.","In North America, we were less concentrated with larger deals specifically in Ashburn and had more numerous wins in San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, and Chicago. But when you look apples to apples of signing in those same markets, and is close in terms of size. Those rates actually look flat to suddenly up. I think, I said in a earlier conference this year looking at Ashburn, for our third quarter signing where we did a lot of larger deals, our rates versus the prior 12 months were within like 100 basis points. So definitely speaking to a crescendo on the rates.","Now, I'm not saying that there isn't a competitor that's going to throw in a low price out there, just to win a business. But I think we bring a lot to the table as Bill, mentioned with our global platform that\u2019s multi-product our installed and growing customer base that wants to expand with adjacency, longest runway for a growth in a competitive market like Ashburn and other things agile to supply chain and counterparty risk as well. ","I think last but not least, you really are touching on development returns and also bookings compositions. I think if you look at our development cycle what you're seeing are two things. There's a concentration of our current products in the development project pipeline are larger deals 20, 25 megawatt deals, 10 to 15 year lease terms, AAA minus rated credit counter parties, triple net leases. Hence they're pushing those North America returns down closer to the nines.","And then outside the U.S., which is becoming a much larger share of our new growth be it on that table you\u2019ll see it in Singapore, but also Osaka and the same thing over in Europe. The returns are a little lower, but you're also seeing those returns in an interest rate environment in those countries that is much, much lower than the U.S. And you could see that in the fact that we did seven year euro bonds two weeks ago at a 2.5% coupon. I think, I kind of hit them all there for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Erik Rasmussen","Yes, thanks. So maybe just want to focus again on Northern Virginia. There is a lot of capital coming into the major markets especially Northern Virginia, which is shaping a lot of the development. But what are your thoughts on the private companies making these major investments for plan data center space? And how that impacts the overall industry and general fears of potential oversupply?","William Stein","Thanks, Erik. We've commented on this before. While there is a tremendous amount of supply obviously in Northern Virginia, there's an equal amount of demand, so absorption has been very strong. As I said earlier and Andy mentioned this too, if the hyperscale players have to choose between a private provider with whom they've done little to no business and Digital with whom they've done a substantial amount of business and they are also keen to bring their product to market as quickly as possible at least it\u2019s been our experience that they would prefer to do business with the provider that offers the shortest cycle for providing a product.","So that has to do with both contract and reliable construction deliveries and knowing that the building is going to operate as expected.","Erik Rasmussen","Great. And just maybe my follow up, kind of efficiencies in the past you talked about efficiencies in the various ways to control, bill cost to manage returns. But how much of those efficiencies can you still pull from? And are we coming towards the end where you may start to see some headwind because you don't have those same levers to pull. Thank you.","William Stein","So I think our team has done an excellent job of bringing out the cost from data centers design. But I think you note correctly that we're approaching a level where it's going to be difficult to take out more costs without impacting residual value. I think we're fortunate and that we've established that our VMI or vendor managed inventory and program in place with most of our major suppliers. And what that means is we have three year contracts in place that lock in pricing for critical equipment like generators switch gear, UPS modules. And so, we haven't been affected by rising steel prices because of those programs.","It's also I think important for you to keep in mind that we are still the only data center REIT with investment grade ratings from all the major rating agencies and that gives us a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. And finally, we've been able to derisk labor inflation by keeping our contractors on site. So to sum up we have the benefits of buying in bulk across a global sales funnel. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Michael Rollins ","Hi. Two questions if I could. First, I noticed that you took out the goal for asset monetization relative to prior guidance tables. And I was wondering if you could size the potential for asset monetization and optimization of the portfolio and what kind of market is out there for the assets that would be up for consideration?","And then just switching gears as you look at the hyperscale deployment that you've accommodated over the last couple of years, is there a way to quantify any magnetic effect those deployments are having to also get to additional enterprise bookings in a similar or nearby campus that either wanted to be close to the cloud or employ a hybrid cloud architecture? Thanks.","Andrew Power ","Hey. Thanks, Michael. I'll tackle the first question then I'll pass it over to Chris on the second one. So asset monetization still is really very much part of our DNA here. It's in our heritage, and I think you could see that by the fact that even on the portfolio optimization and capital recycling track for some time, I think we sold about $800 plus million of assets outright in the last handful of years. I'm pretty sure that's more than any other data center provider out there.","And also we are big fans of having our fishing pool in all the different pools of capital, both public and private. And that includes outright or joint venture ownership. And we've deployed joint venture ownership across multiple formats. So I would say we look through our portfolio and try to find areas where we want to focus and defocus and also opportunities to further optimize our capital structure through the use of private capital.","I think, you could expect us to continue to focus our investment in the major markets where we see additional runway for growth the Ashburn\u2019s and Santa Clara type markets or Dallas and Chicago\u2019s, in North America, the Frankfurt's, London's, Dublin's, Amsterdam's in Europe and Osaka, Tokyo, Singapore and Sydney in Australia and Asia. And I think we'll see less of a focus on some of those other markets in terms of where we put further dollars or continue to invest.","And with -- I'd say now over 200 data centers almost entirely unencumbered, the majority of which own fee simple. I think we've got a credible amount of flexibility to optimize our portfolio efficiently track various forms of capital and to recycle capital when we find it appropriate.","Chris, do you want to hit the hyperscale and overall echo system question?","Chris Sharp","Yes, thanks Andy. Appreciate the question, Michael. So there's a couple elements to that. So it is somewhat hard to quantify. But still a lot of the industry research and papers out there are still indicating the fact that the enterprise 80 plus percent of that enterprises looking to achieve that hybrid multi cloud. ","So one of the things we've often looked at, and we constantly track is not only the amount of uptake on the service exchange, which allows private connectivity to all of the major cloud providers on a very open platform, which we\u2019ve referenced in the past and at a couple of conferences where you have access to 109 cloud on ramps associated with that platform, which is very, demonstrably and allowing customers to efficiently achieve the hybrid connectivity or access to these hyperscale services.","And then I'd say the other key indicator that we've been watching a lot is the proximity, right? And so allowing enterprises to deploy chasing point in Ashburn where you could be immersed in the largest cloud epicenter in the world is a major differentiator, which is why you see a lot of the construction and the build in the amount of infrastructure pipeline that we have in that market. Because it's just a key indicator of the amount of uptick that we have associated with that.","I don't have any specific metrics on how to quantify the attach rate to that at this point in time, but that's something that we constantly track and are really putting in a very tight model to our sales team to ensure that they're having that dialogue with the enterprise customers that they know which clouds they're betting their business on. ","And how easily and efficiently consume them either via the service exchange, which is private connectivity or which is unique to our connected campus. The proximity of being deployed right next door to it, which Andy had referenced in the script earlier with IBM, which is a very unique model where customers can be right next door to the actual cloud services they're consuming.","So we see a lot of that uptick coming to the market and we see no ending sight for a lot of that hybrid multi-cloud architectures. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Guttman of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Robert Guttman","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about the state of power availability in Northern Virginia and whether or not that is any constraint on market growth there? And secondly, last year's the full year\u2019s leasing in North America was largely focused in Northern Virginia. I was wondering if when you're looking at the sales pipeline how does -- how did the rest of the markets look in U.S. versus a similar comparison the same time last year in terms of pipeline.","William Stein","Thanks, Robert. I'll jump on the first question and I think Andy will pick up the second piece. But, as far as power availability in Northern Virginia one of the things that we often really start to look at is how we master plan the multiple campuses that we've built out there. And one of the key elements of that master plan is working with the local power providers and early on establishing a demand profile associated with not only what we have today, but where we're headed.","And a part of that is investing and ensuring that we get the proper substations built inside of the market, which is very unique to digital and from our long heritage in building out these campuses to ensure that we don't run out of any power. So not only with the campuses that we have populated today, but the future expansion campuses we're already in deep dialogue with a lot of local utility providers to ensure that we have proper access and redundant access in these core markets even outside of Northern Virginia.","So we see nothing impacting our ability to meet our customer demand with the master plan facilities that we have today and also the future expansion that we have in that market. And I'll hand it over to Andy for the second part. ","Andrew Power ","Thanks, Rob. So I mean if you look back at the fourth quarter or -- and a little bit of 2018 in terms of North America composition, fourth quarter was really not about Ashburn at all for us it was much more diverse. So we had north of a megawatt size in the San Francisco property area, we had signings in Houston close to a megawatt, Dallas, also in Chicago. And if I also go back a handful of quarters, I can certainly recall other major signing in the Chicago market as well as on the Dallas campus.","Now those signings obviously get a little bit round out when you do a 25 megawatt deal in any given quarter. But it wasn't solely isolated to Ashburn or Northern Virginia. When I turn to looking at North America for 2019, I do think you'll still see a consistent demand for that Ashburn, Virginia robust demand market. But I think the conversations at Digital range a little more broadly all the way up into our newest delivery Toronto campus also out to some Santa Clara discussions. I know there has been some activity growing on our Richardson campus in Dallas.","And then a market that's been a little bit of a sleeper going back a year or two is the New York City metro or northern New Jersey market where we've seen a pickup in financial services related demand on a few locations in that market. So definitely seeing the demand spread out a little bit to more pockets within North America portfolio in 2019 it feels like that it did in prior years. ","And going back, I apologize, I think I skipped one of Colby\u2019s questions ask about outlook for 2019 international versus non-international. Obviously we have the Ascenty portfolio, which is going to be go from count zero towards our $268 million record signings in 2018 and be a part of the picture in 2019. But putting that aside and really comparing apples to apples when I look at the inventory backdrop be it our campuses in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and London. Some of the enterprise customer demand we're seeing in Dublin are new announcements, which we had in Sydney, Australia in terms of new deliveries and also in Osaka, Japan.","I think what -- in the last year or two it was probably more of a 75% to 80% signings in North America and remainder outside of the U.S. or North America. I think you could see that complexion should become much more global. And I can tell you that was a major theme as we kicked off the year from a strategy to really kind of speak selling to our strengths of the global multi-product platform.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, for any closing remarks.","William Stein","Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our 2018 highlights, as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. We advanced our top priority of deepening connections with our customers delivering record bookings of $268 million, a 35% increase from the previous all-time high the prior year.","We further expanded our global platform with our entry into Latin America. And we further extended our sustainability leadership with the addition of 90 megawatts of renewable energy capacity. We delivered 8% growth in FFO per share at the top end of our original guidance, and we delivered double-digit growth in AFFO per share setting the stage for continued growth in our dividend.","Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet, raising $1.1 billion of common equity to fund our future growth, refinancing our $3.3 billion credit facilities and issuing over $1 billion of long-term investment grade corporate bonds at very attractive coupons.","As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty team whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. Thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida in March.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive quarter characterized by healthy leasing activity and solid execution against virtually every objective of our strategic plan laid out here on page two of our earnings deck.","As you may have seen, we announced this afternoon that we've appointed Dan Papes as Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. Dan was most recently President of Unify North America, formerly Siemens Networking Systems, where he had responsibility for managing all aspects of the business with total ownership of the P&L. Dan is a technology industry veteran with a 27-year career with our largest customer, primarily in the outsourcing and managed services business, including roles as Vice President of Global Cloud Services Sales and Vice President of Global Telecommunications Industry Sales. He has experienced leading global sales organizations and he has been responsible for driving significant growth in revenues, deal volume and profitability. We are delighted to welcome Dan to the team and we are confident that he is the right choice to help lead our global sales engine to the next level.","I would like to take a moment here to thank Andrew Schaap who ran our scale sales team on an interim basis, along with Tony Rossabi who continues to lead our colocation and interconnection line of business for their leadership and professionalism, while we ran the search for a permanent sales and marketing leader. They are both key assets to our organization and the solid rebound in bookings during the third quarter is a direct testament to their capabilities and the depth of our talent. The third quarter capital allocation highlight was closing on the acquisition of a portfolio of eight highly strategic data centers in London, Amsterdam and Frankfurt, as shown here on page three. This transaction was strategic and complementary to our existing business; it was financially accretive, and prudently financed.","In terms of integration, we are underway towards a smooth transition of the acquired business into Digital Realty. In late September, we announced the appointment of Rob Coupland as Managing Director for the region. Rob, previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Telecity and we are delighted that he accepted our offer to stay on after the acquisition and lead our expanded regional platform. Also in September, we officially opened our Amsterdam data tower. The 72-meter high tower was designed and built using the latest advanced technologies and has over 5,000 square meters of space and will have fully built out IT load of nine megawatts. Based on its location at the Amsterdam Science Park, our customers will have the ability to interconnect within a rich ecosystem of telecom organizations, Internet service providers, and cable companies.","In addition, we are on track to deliver the first of three phases of our 27 megawatt campus in Frankfurt in the second half of 2017. We have seen significant demand from several customers, including the major global cloud service providers. We've also recently completed ISO certification of the newly acquired sites. Over the next quarter, we will be stabilizing our operations in the region and executing our business objectives. We also closed on the sale of our fully leased Saint-Denis data center in Paris during the third quarter, as well as the previously announced sale of a four-property domestic datacenter portfolio. We do still have three small assets held for sale on the balance sheet but the completion of the portfolio sale substantially concludes the capital recycling program we embarked upon in the second quarter of 2014. As I've said on several occasions, we've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott Peterson and his team have achieved on the sale of our non-core assets.","Let's turn to the expansion of our product offerings on page four. We announced the launch of our Service Exchange at MarketplaceLIVE in September. Service Exchange is an interconnection platform that facilitates direct, private and secure connections to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, as well as telecommunications providers and other Digital Realty customers worldwide. Service Exchange simplifies interconnection and makes access between interconnected services, providers and businesses more flexible, more scalable, and easier to use than ever before. Upon launching in November, Service Exchange will offer significantly greater performance, reliability and security for cloud services and data center access than the public internet. Service Exchange is powered by Megaport combining our respective core strengths. Digital Realty's high-availability datacenter offerings cover the spectrum from single rack co-location to multiple megawatt deployments around the world to suit our customers' current needs and to enable their future growth.","Megaport, a leading provider of elastic interconnection has developed a platform that will keep pace with innovative cloud technologies and continue to expand to new markets. Service Exchange is critical to our customers. A recent survey from RightScale reports that 82% of enterprises are adopting a multi-cloud strategy citing security, managing multiple clouds and the lack of resources as the top three challenges of leveraging the cloud effectively. Service Exchange accelerates adoption of public and hybrid cloud architectures by simplifying private access to multiple clouds.","Our Partners and Alliances program continues to grow, with several of our important partner sponsoring and participating in our very successful MarketplaceLIVE event, highlighting the value of our ecosystem to our partners. During the third quarter, we executed hybrid cloud transactions with one of the best partners that highlights the value of our global Connected Campus strategy. This program is expected to ramp up with our partner in the fourth quarter, as we launch our go-to-market campaign in several markets. In addition, with the announcement of Service Exchange, we are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our existing partners as well as several potential new partners seeking to incorporate the capabilities of Service Exchange into their own offerings. We are very excited about the expanded opportunities Service Exchange brings to our partnerships. Our pipeline via our Partners and Alliances program remains robust at approximately $40 million, and deals executed during the quarter grew our bookings by nearly 20% since the launch of our Partners and Alliances program in early 2015.","Let's turn now to market fundamentals on page five. Construction activity remains elevated across the primary data center markets, but so does net absorption as well as the level of pre-leasing on development pipelines. Demand is outpacing supply, competitors are behaving rationally, new entrants remain few and far between, and we are seeing healthy consolidation. In addition to our solid leasing volume during the third quarter, our forward funnel is similarly robust. Based on the current sales pipeline, there's a good chance we will be completely sold out of the remaining inventory on our existing campuses in Ashburn, Virginia, as well as Franklin Park in Chicago within the next couple of quarters.","Given the current pace of absorption of the remaining inventory on our major connected campuses, we took steps to secure our supply chain and supply our customers future growth during the third quarter as shown here on page six with the acquisition of land parcels adjacent to our existing campuses in Ashburn and Chicago, as well as the site of a future campus in Garland, Texas once our Richardson campus is fully sold out.","And now let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, whereas we appear to be edging closer to an interest rate tightening cycle in the U.S. As I've said many times before, the drivers underpinning data center demand are secular in nature and growing faster than the broader economy. Similarly, we've built our organization to thrive, regardless of our environment, with irreplaceable global platform, a fortress balance sheet, and a deep bench of incredibly talented, hard-working employees.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Power to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity on page nine. Our total bookings for the third quarter were a little over $55 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. We assigned new leases for space and power totaling $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter, including an $8 million co-location contribution. Our third quarter signings speak to our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to win robust yet profitable demand from a diverse global customer set. Third quarter wins included top cloud service providers signing across multiple locations and multiple continents.","They also included a smaller, but rapidly growing new customer signing across four different locations within North America alone. In addition, the team delivered an 18% increase in co-location and interconnection signings in the U.S. with our interconnection bookings representing a record quarterly performance since our acquisition of Telx and one of the top three quarters in Telx's history.","I would like to pause here to point out that we have revised our headline total bookings presentation to include the contribution from interconnection. We will continue to provide precisely the same information and the same level of granularity, but we will now be including the interconnection contribution in our total bookings to more closely align our presentation with our peers.","At the market level, there's a lot of excitement in Chicago these days. And I'm not just talking about the Cubbies. As Bill mentioned, we are nearing delivery and leasing of the last few megawatts on our Franklin Park campus and we have secured the adjacent land parcel to support our continued growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we took assignment of a bespoke co-location reseller customer's PBB lease for 83,000 rentable square feet at 350 East Cermak in downtown Chicago. And we also took ownership of data center improvements and infrastructure with a total of nearly six megawatts of capacity, an original cost basis of approximately $85 million and a current fair market value of approximately $35 million.","As part of this transaction, we took assignment of 15 co-location customer leases and entered into a new agreement with a reseller to maintain a smaller footprint in the building. This transaction did not require us to make any material payment to the reseller and provides us with more than 4.5 megawatts of immediately available IT load and customer-ready space in our flagship Internet gateway which has remained north of 96% leased for the past six years. Finally, we recently kicked off a marketing and pre-leasing campaign to line up anchor tenants for a potential data center development project at 330 East Cermak on a land parcel adjacent to our existing property at 350 East Cermak.","Turning to our backlog on page 10, the current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, up $14 million from the prior quarter. The weighted-average lag between third quarter signings and commencements remain healthy at four months below the historical average of roughly six months.","Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 11, we retained 82% of the third quarter lease expirations and we signed $44 million of renewals in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was slightly positive with healthy cash mark-to-market on PBB, colo and non-technical space offset by a roll down on turnkey renewals. As expected, we did execute renewals on the above market leases in Phoenix that we've called out for the last couple of quarters, which drove the roll down on the third quarter turnkey renewals. We do still have several above-market leases remaining now primarily in the Northeast region. So, we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter.","On balance, however, we still expect re-leasing spreads will be slightly positive on a cash basis for full year 2016. In addition, we expect cash re-leasing spreads will also be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","In terms of our third quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy is down 50 basis points sequentially to 89.9%. As you can see from the occupancy bridge we provided here on page 12, the primary driver of the dip in portfolio occupancy was the acquisition of the sub-70% lease portfolio in Europe along with recent completions in space previously held for development that was placed in service during the third quarter. It's important to note that portfolio occupancy is measured on the basis of square footage, which does not always directly correspond it to invested capital.","If you turn to the next slide on page 13, you'll see that the balance of available fully built-out inventory relative to total inventory as measured on the y-axis has been reduced more than half. This dramatic reduction in our finished inventory has been directly responsible for the 140-basis-point improvement we have achieved in our return on invested capital over the same period, which we believe is truly a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size.","Let's turn to Telx here on page 14. The colocation and interconnection line of business generated $97 million of revenue during the third quarter. Although revenues remain split roughly 50-50, interconnection outpaced colocation with the year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%. From the legacy 20 locations and prior two expense synergies, Telx generated $39 million of cash EBITDA during the third quarter. While the quarterly increase in revenue continued to accelerate, EBITDA remained relatively flat due to timing of spend related to marketing activities around MarketplaceLIVE and other initiatives as well as some costs associated with the final stages of our integration. We do expect enhanced revenue flow through going forward and incremental growth in EBITDA during the fourth quarter and on into next year. Key initiatives during the quarter included the launch of colocation at our Ashburn campus, expansion underway at multiple new locations in North America as well as MarketplaceLIVE.","The strategy of the colocation and interconnection product line continues to be in focus on key facilities both interconnection hubs and connected campuses to drive growth and nurture awareness and understanding of the identified ecosystems. Many colocation customers may not be aware of key customers, vendors or partners that maybe easily accessed within the same building or Connected Campus. Identifying these natural magnets and leveraging their position within the connectivity ecosystem attracts and breeds growth.","With respect to expanding our customer base, we have emphasized the continued development of target verticals and communities. During the third quarter, the colocation and interconnection team added 34 new customers across a variety of market segments. Year-to-date through September, 113 new customers have been added. In terms of market expansions, our colocation and interconnection team is in the process of expanding its footprint across eight markets in North America, representing more than 5 megawatts of incremental capacity, not including the full transfer of 365 Main in San Francisco completed earlier this year. We launched colocation services on our campus in Ashburn, Virginia, during the third quarter.","Funnel activity has met expectations, and new sales bookings have been positive. Capacity expansion is also underway in Atlanta and will leverage the existing (20:52) and connected customer base at 56 Marietta, allowing customers to reach a robust community of connectivity from the launch date through the use of diverse fiber extensions. Available capacity at 56 Marietta will be sufficient in the interim or customers may pre-purchase space and power as needed.","Finally, MarketplaceLIVE 2016 was an overwhelming success with attendance at record levels. The enhanced format and expanded venue were well received by customers and provided excellent backdrop for the announcement of the launch of our new Service Exchange in partnership with Megaport.","In summary, we are pleased with the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line and look forward to a continued progress, as we refine our go to market strategy to incorporate the ecosystem model, expand capacity and extend our colocation reach in North America and globally. At the one-year mark post-closing, we are on track to meet or exceed our underlying (21:53) targets and conclude the integration process.","The volatility in currencies during the quarter and in recent weeks continues to create a headwind with regard to growth. FX represented a 100-basis-piont to 200-basis-piont drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on page 15. I would like to remind everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.","Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will look to continue this FX hedging strategy by issuing sterling-denominated debt over the next several months as part of our corporate funding plan to term out our balance outstanding under our revolver at that time. This financing will further reduce our exposure to currency fluctuation, as we head into 2017. I would like to remind everyone that while our global footprint exposes our reported earnings to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy the data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe is a key competitive advantage.","Same capital cash NOI was up a little less than 1% on a reported basis and up a little more than 2% on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, same capital cash NOI growth is positive 3.6% on a reported basis. And we still expect to be well within the guidance range of 2.5% to 4% for the full year. As you may have seen from the press release, we reported core FFO per share of $1.44 for the third quarter, an increase of 9% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. For the full year, we reiterated core FFO per share guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 on a reported basis and constant currency guidance of $5.70 to $5.90, representing 8% and 10% growth respectively.","Turning to the longer-term outlook on page 16 that we introduced on our Investor Day last October, you may recall that we got into a mid-to-high single digit FFO per share growth and double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016. We're certainly tracking ahead of plan on both fronts, but notably, AFFO per share growth that has been driven by year-to-date operating outperformance, accretion from Telx, the continued reduction in straight-line rental revenue and lower than expected recurring CapEx spend. For the full year, we now expect to deliver 20% growth in AFFO per share. Longer-term, we do expect both FFO and AFFO per share growth to converge in the mid-to-high single digits, and we plan to give formal guidance for 2017, early next year.","By way of preview, we do expect continued headwinds from the strong dollar and tougher comps due to a full year contribution from Telx, as well as the burn-off of the one-time benefits to AFFO in 2016. Absent external growth from acquisitions, which are inherently difficult to predict, we would expect to see somewhat slower growth in 2017 than 2016 in both earnings and cash flow per share. That being said, we have delivered positive year-over-year growth in core FFO per share and dividends per share each and every year as a public company and we do not expect 2017 will be any exception.","Let's turn to the balance sheet beginning on page 17. As anticipated on our last call in July, we settled the bulk of our forward sale agreements during the third quarter, issuing 12 million shares and generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of the net proceeds was used to permanently finance the European acquisition portfolio for approximately $874 million. We also generated net proceeds of approximately $320 million from the asset sales Bill described earlier and we recognized a gain on sale of $169 million during the third quarter.","We also redeemed our 7% Series E Preferred Stock during the third quarter for approximately $290 million. We recognized a $10 million non-cash Topic D-42 charge for the write-off of the original issuance cost, which is an add-back to core FFO. We also prepaid $136 million of mortgage debt at a 5.9% weighted average interest rate during the third quarter. We expect to retire an additional $108 million at an average coupon a little north of 6% during the fourth quarter. We expect to fund this pay down by settling the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into this past May.","Upon retirement of the mortgage debt pre-payable during the fourth quarter, we will have just $3 million of secured debt remaining, or well under 1% of total debt outstanding. We have also proactively termed out short-term variable rate debt with longer term fixed rate financing, and as shown on page 18, floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.","Even in a rising rate environment, a 100-basis-point move in LIBOR would impact full year FFO per share by roughly $0.03 or less than 1%. Our leverage is likewise on target with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.1 times at September 30. Pro forma for the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements, debt-to-EBIDTA will be less than 5 times. Our balance sheet is poised for new investment opportunities consistent with our long-term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Ed, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. First question comes down to guidance. Some of the assumptions moved around slightly; the one that you touched on was occupancy, and I was hoping maybe you can shed a little bit more light. You may have mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but on the overall reduction there in the assumption? And then, on the other side of things, it seems like you were ahead on a number of metrics and I would have thought ultimately that that would have contributed to better FFO growth on the year on a core basis, at least. Can you maybe just speak to those two points?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So, maybe turning to the guidance first. We reiterated the same guidance as the previous quarter of $5.65 to $5.75 core FFO per share. There were some slight adjustments to some of the assumptions. We increased the EBITDA margin, I think, 50 basis points on the low end, a 30 basis point tweak on the G&A.","The change to the year-end portfolio occupancy to being down was really a product of a few things. One, we're absorbing obviously the European portfolio assets into the total portfolio occupancy, and that number includes existing vacancy. That portfolio is roughly 66% leased as of the third quarter. Plus in addition to that, as you may have saw, we recently opened up our data tower in Amsterdam at the Science Park, which is a brand new, up to nine megawatts asset, which is part of this transaction that will also bring some vacancy into the quarter.","And then the other major driver I'd say is, in connection with the transaction in Chicago in our 350 Cermak building where we took the assignment of a PBB lease, obviously that will go from a 100% occupied 83,000 square feet to a much lower occupied amount with the existing colocation customers in the suite. Net-net, we think that was a great transaction for not only for the exiting customer but really for Digital in terms of getting our hands on very valuable market-ready space in an incredibly hot market. That asset's been north of 96% for numerous years now.","And then going to your second question, overall the quarter, I think depending on whose metrics, we either beat by a penny or met consensus estimates, but it was pretty much in line with our forecast. I think there was a handful of positive things that you probably were highlighting. The one thing I would say not negative but something that maybe put a little bit of drag on our third quarter growth was the increase in the G&A, which was probably related to onboarding the European portfolio, which was expected.","I think an unexpected growth component of the G&A was some of the overall integration-related work on the onboarding from that acquisition which closed in early July and travel and work to bring that team into the fold, and probably some other activity around the or seasonally-related activity around our Marketplace Live initiative and other events. And the last thing I can think of off the top of my head, we did bring on two new board member during the quarter which has a little bit of incremental cost to the company, but I think they will be well worth it in the long run.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, the question I had was around interconnection revenues, and I was interested in both the legacy Digital Realty properties as well as legacy Telecity over in Europe, and what are your plans or what's the progress towards phasing in the interconnects towards more of a recurring revenue stream?","And then the follow-up is just looking at slide six, the land parcel slide made me wonder a little bit about Santa Clara, and how you view some of the opportunities there including maybe inorganic growth. And then any kind of update on Frankfurt's given that you have a building there and then you also have a new build that you've entered into, and so what are some of the plans that you have in that market? Thanks very much.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So, interconnection, Santa Clara, Frankfurt, I'll do the first one and then I'll toss the last two to Scott. On interconnection, we are obviously integrating and bringing on board not only eight great assets in the Dockland, (34:17) the Science Park and also in Frankfurt, but a really tremendous team and also a new leader to lead our EMEA region.","Their interconnection model had a very significant portion of reoccurring revenue spend, or not exact type of productization, but similar recurring revenue model. There will be further alignment across the global portfolio in terms of our interconnection services as we move forward. We've experienced, as you saw, a very strong quarter for interconnection signings quarter-over-quarter. And I think that is hopefully going to continue, and I think you are going to find us continue on those eight parts of the portfolio we're expanding our colocation, interconnection footprint be it in existing Internet gateways where Telx has historical resided, or on our connected campuses like in Ashburn or Richardson or other pockets of the portfolio. And I'll turn the Silicon Valley question over to Scott Peterson.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","On Santa Clara, we all know that there is discussion about a portfolio that's available on the market there. And we look at every opportunity in the marketplace, as we all know. We'll always keep an eye on that to see whether we view it as being strategic and how well it integrates into our portfolio and if it represents a good economic value and a good investment for our shareholders.","We have a couple of land sites, smaller land sites available for future development in Santa Clara. We continue to look for additional capacity in that market since it's a good market. I think anybody familiar with that would know it's a tough market from a land perspective, so we need to be very creative in terms of acquiring more inventory there.","As far as Frankfurt goes, we're very pleased with the level of activity. We're getting in that market. I think it started off very strong, and we'll continue to propose that to a number of customers on that, and so we've been very happy with the progress there so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, it's Paul Morgan. Just on the Service Exchange rollout and your interconnection, your volumes, how should we think about the timing of the rollout into additional markets? It looks like you've got kind of about half the ones you planned through 2017? Is that a near-term in Europe and the rest of the U.S.? And then that $9 million, 16% of your bookings in the quarter that's a good number. How are you guys thinking about that as a share and as a potential growth rate going forward, especially after the Service Exchange roll out?","Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. This is Jarrett. In terms of the Service Exchange, we're committed to an open environment. We've traditionally won business in the network-to-network, network-to-content, and network-to-enterprise verticals. This really gives us an opportunity to participate in the cloud ecosystem, which requires a new product offering and capability. So day one, we're announcing primarily our North America platform, but we're phasing it where we actually control the portal, we control the customer experience, and this allows our customers to essentially order virtual cross connects. So the phasing is largely deployed. We wanted to have colocation, interconnection, and our scale offerings, and now with the European assets we'll accelerate that as our second phase. So ultimately we'll have 15 markets, 24 data centers by second quarter of next year.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then my other question...","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Maybe I'll...","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","No, no, please, go ahead. If you want to say it again just to make sure we address it appropriately.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","No, I was going on to my follow-ups. If you have something more to say on interconnects, that's great.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I was just going to address I think to your question on the $9 million. So that's $9 million of total interconnection signings this quarter, we were $8 million or around $8 million last quarter. I am not sure we're going to continue that pace of quarter-over-quarter acceleration; it's quite rapid. But I think the key is continuing to bring on space at these very interconnection-dense locations as one part to spur additional interconnection revenue, and I think we're doing that by expanding in the likes of 56 Marietta, getting additional inventory in Cermak and other locations. And then I think the next leg of it will be leveraging the interconnection revenue that will come from the enterprise, the cloud, coming off the Service Exchange. But I think that second part will be more of a (39:27) later in the 2017 revenue generation.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. And then just in terms of a couple of markets where you're committing capital for expansion, can you maybe comment on Northern Virginia and Chicago and the competitive environment there? You have some of your peers also doing the same. And I know what you've said about the demand-supply equilibrium now. But if you look into 2017 and 2018, how are you thinking about \u2013 give us an update how you're thinking about your preleasing and the future demand-supply balance?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Those were two particular markets, and we have a little bit of a \u2013 a little map in the deck of our campuses in Franklin Park in Chicago and obviously in Ashburn, Virginia. And based on pipeline signings we've completed to-date or through the end of the quarter, I should say, plus pipeline, there is a decent potential that we could be finishing out our existing (40:35) campus, the last 9377 building of Franklin Park and the last buildings on our Ashburn campus in the next several quarters, which should dovetail very well with the timing of deliveries of those parcels that are literally adjacent to the campus coming online. So those markets obviously are not without competition, but we seem to win our fair share and having a fairly robust pipeline in those two particular markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys. Just maybe sticking with the Chicago market, you've got some land now in Franklin Park, you've got potential build-out next to the E Cermak and you took back some availability from the PBB tenant. Just curious based on your pipeline demand funnel, where are you seeing I guess more demand? Is it more downtown or is it in the Franklin Park area?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hey, Vin. It's Andy again. We're seeing the demand in both locations. It's just different types of demand and at obviously different price points. As I just mentioned \u2013 on Franklin Park you're typically catering to a customer that is looking for more affordable total cost of ownership, seeking large amounts of space and power, and likely seeking an economic model that's in the low $100s per kilowatts.","If you're going down to Cermak, we're signing and filling up space, including the space we just took possession of, at rates that could be more than double that. And that customer is obviously not taking \u2013 likely taking one megawatts to two megawatts at a time, is taking smaller quantums. They could be around 300 kilowatts, 400 kilowatts, but they're really taking those small amounts of space and willing to pay those higher prices in order to have the connectivity that our Cermak building offers. So we're seeing I'd say different demand sets in both locations but both seem fairly strong.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a question on the bookings trends. Last quarter there was concerns about the slowdown in bookings and then you had also announced some activity in early 3Q and it was discussed as a timing issue. So you take the two quarters together, you're at the $40 million-ish mark, which is relatively close to what it was in the prior couple quarters.","Given the fact that you now have additional availability here in Chicago, you've got a new head of sales in place, some other development availability on the European portfolio as well, I guess, should we expect some steady increases in those bookings numbers, or is there any reason to think that we wouldn't see that in the next several quarters?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's fair to say. There's no surprises on this end that we were not pleased with the second quarter, but if you look at the third quarter, which was a quarter that quite frankly we were without a global head of sales for two-thirds of it and had a tremendous effort by both Andrew Schaap and Tony Rossabi stepping up to deliver for us.","Net-net, I was pretty happy where the third quarter came out. I think there are some key takeaways that when I look through it, it was somewhat in our script. The demand was robust and diverse. We weren't counting on one single customer to do a single 10-meg deal. We had numerous customers, we had cloud service providers, other parts of SMACC, IT service.","The demand was in North America but also in Europe. It was probably one of our best signings quarter in Europe for several quarters now. A good chunk of those signings were actually in the London market post the Brexit vote, and those signings came not only from cloud service providers; they came from a disaster recovery firm, they came from an IT service firm. So lots of different demand drivers filling our existing signings in our funnel going into the fourth quarter.","I wouldn't tell you I could bank on $55 million again in the fourth quarter, but I think when we have that pretty steady-eddie run rate trend \u2013 if you look back, and I think we have on our slide deck like a rolling LTM number that kind of looks how our trends are fairly smooth if you look over a long time period.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's \u2013 it's Scott here \u2013 that's page 21, I believe of the appendix. If you look at that, it does quarter-by-quarter on a trailing 12 months and you'll see that there's a much smoother line there, if you will. We always talk about the business being lumpy. So if you compare that with the signings in the main deck, you'll see how that smoothes out the lumpiness a little bit. The only one to take a look at is you'll see a little bump in early 2014, which is we had \u2013 kind of, we had very high signings when we were clearing through that excess inventory that had been built over the prior year-and-a-half or so. So that's a good illustration of how the \u2013 if you look over longer timeframes, the lumpiness gets smoothed out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. If we think about the situation in Cermak where you took out that PBB customer, how many of those types of scenarios are you looking at across your portfolio where you might step in and do something like that?","Jarrett Appleby - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Manny, they are always kind of few and far between. It's a product of the expiration schedules of various customers, our demand in those locations. I would say they're somewhat of events where the stars and moon and sun have to align. In Cermak we had a very highly leased, high-demand building with a customer, due to some regulatory constraints was looking to exit that building. Their lease I think only had like a year-and-a-half or so to run on it, so there was a path to a transaction that was beneficial to them and obviously beneficial to us. There is a handful of other pockets in the portfolio where that may apply, but I wouldn't say that is something that we can necessarily count on in any regards.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then going back to the occupancy guidance, just to make sure that I and other people on the call understand this correctl, when you say down 150 basis points to 200 basis points, that's versus December 31 of last year, correct?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Correct.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And so right now you're roughly 150 basis points down already. So you're saying that you could go down another 50 basis points from here through year-end. Is that right?","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","We are saying we'll go down another...","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","91.4%...","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Manny, this is John Stewart. We expect to be flat from here.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So the 89.9% where you ended is already at that guidance point?","John J. Stewart - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Correct.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great, thank you. I want to talk about the color commentary you gave on 2017 growth and how you anticipate it I think moderately slowing down. And I am just curious, is that based on just the trajectory of bookings and what's happened so far in 2016 and how you see that getting installed over the next few months and how that might make it more difficult to achieve the same growth in 2017 already at this point. Is it more a change in your expectation around market dynamics, whether it's in demand or pricing or is it perhaps even just a mix shift in terms of the assets you have now versus what you may have had going into 2016.","And then I guess as a part of that, I was wondering if you can give some color on how the eight facilities that you acquired from Equinix\/Telecity have been performing in terms of growth maybe over the last year, or any other color you can provide so we get a sense of what those assets look like in terms of their trajectory? Thank you.","Andrew Power - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure, Colby. The answer to your first question, those are some good ideas, but really, foreign currency is the biggest headwind. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we obviously look to hedge that with issuing sterling bonds, euro bonds, multi-currency revolver, and term loan. But there is obviously a spread between the yields on our assets and the cost of that debt. And that's \u2013 again, it's earnings translation risk, not economic risk. We're not repatriating capital in a meaningful way that we are having losses, but the FX I would say is the largest driver to that, I would say, sentiment preview. And then on the eight or so \u2013 on the eight European assets, five in London, two in Amsterdam, one in Frankfurt, maybe I will let \u2013 give Scott a chance to jump in on performance with the underwriting?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Hi, Colby. Thanks. Yeah, so the performance since acquisition, it's only been a short time and so we've been very pleased with that performance. We're on track. If you looked at the performance prior to the acquisition, you saw \u2013 I think, your question was performance and specifically vacancy. You saw the vacancy there tick up a little bit and that was primarily the result of two large tenants migrating \u2013 customers migrating out of the portfolio, one of which came to us in our portfolio and the other one actually left and went to a \u2013 it was a gaming company that went closer to their corporate headquarters, geographically far away. But other than that the stickiness there has been pretty good and the velocity has been good too.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","And are those facilities growing at a rate similar, for example, to the Telx portfolio or is it more in line with the traditional DLRs, any color on that?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","From a utilization standpoint, probably a little closer to the Telx portfolio, if that's what you are...","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","I was talking about revenue growth.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Oh, revenue growth, it was \u2013 kind of \u2013 it's in between where we are and Telx.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sumit Sharma of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, everybody. Thank you for the transparency and the detail in the supplement and everything. Sort of a basic question in terms of, I guess, one of the things that we are wondering was the pricing per square foot or the GAAP rent per square foot for the new signings was kind of lower, down to $126 a square foot. I am struggling to figure out whether this is just regular way lumpiness and a function of product and geographic mix, or was there some pricing pressure that you saw?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","I would say it's more of a mix contribution. We had a significant amount of signings from several customers and I'd say one of our lower price point markets, be it Northern Virginia or Chicago versus prior periods where we might have had more signings in the Silicon Valley or other higher priced markets.","Now, the \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 it's tough to take the signings from the second quarter as a great comparable data point. That was obviously a very small sample set in terms of signings, but on apples-to-apples basis, I wouldn't say we're seeing tremendous pricing pressure. The rates are held in relatively flat and the $120s due to concentration in North America in those lower price point markets. And at those rates those signings are still as you can see from our active development pipeline generating returns on our invested capital, unlevered returns right in our target thresholds of 10.5% to 12.5%.","Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. That's superb. If I could ask one more question. I guess in terms of your business mix which, roughly estimating the retail or the colo portion of the business is now or at least over 1Q and 2Q a little less than 30%. I guess, is there some kind of composition level that you foresee into 2017 or 2018? Do you see that go up to one-third or 35% or 40% in terms of just revenues?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","You know, it's \u2013 I would say there is no specific targeted mix that we have on the board that we're shooting for. And you are seeing very strong growth on both fronts. Obviously a substantial amount of our external growth had been acquisition of colocation-oriented, interconnection-oriented facilities over the last few years, which obviously moved that needle in addition to the organic growth associated with those acquisitions. But at the same time, a large chunk of our active development pipeline is developing scale projects, be it on our campus in North America and Asia, Australia or in Europe. And that is still a significant component to the growth. So I am not sure I could tell you the percentages are going to diverge one way or another. We're very focused on having the right assets and the right capabilities across all four continents to capture robust and profitable demand.","Sumit Sharma - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Following up on that a little bit, it seemed like \u2013 with Q2 being light and 1Q was strong in terms of signings, but 3Q is very strong, it seems like the turnkey flex signings were of a bigger scale, a lot more square footage and I guess the average rent per square foot was a little bit lower. But on the colocation side, it seemed like the pricing was better and it seemed like there is some strength there. So kind of taking all this in, how would you characterize the environment for colocation and, I guess, the turnkey flex products? What are you seeing \u2013 where are you seeing strength or weakness?","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Sure. So, the turnkey flex product is what we call scale or previously called wholesale. The bulk of the activity in North America or Northern Virginia, Chicago and Dallas was soft obviously with Silicon Valley kind of falling after that in terms of demand. And it's been \u2013 it was a robust quarter, and the pipeline for the fourth quarter remains robust as well. It's a significant amount of repeat business. It's a significant amount of multi-site business. It's a business where the customer is signing one-time on multiple continents with us. The size of the deals most recently kind of ranged from, call it, almost 1 meg to almost 4 megs in terms of size of scale deal. So there is some variability in that. Some of the bigger customers are taking bigger deployments. I already touched on some of the pricing trends there.","On the colocation and interconnection side, you're really seeing, I think, the combinations of success really strategic internet gateway assets, a talented sales and marketing organization around them, executing on filling those assets up and these assets command higher prices given what they offer to the customers that decide to deploy in these locations.","We, again, \u2013 we're in \u2013 we have a fairly targeted approach to our colocation interconnection efforts. We are not in all 50 states or 100 countries. We picked our spots to be in the internet gateway, the internet hubs or in select connected campuses which have connectivity to the cloud service providers for the enterprise. So, I think, where we picked our spots and how we tackled it, it's been able to generate pretty strong volumes at attractive rates have increase in the last quarter on the colo front.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And one quick follow-up, the European signings are strong. Was that legacy digital or was there any significant contribution from the Telecity-Equinix assets.","Scott Peterson - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","The given \u2013 most of it is legacy digital. The colocation piece was contributed from the assets and the new team that joined the company. So, the 4 megs and $6.6 million of annualized revenue was legacy digital assets.","Operator","And our last question for the call will be from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So I guess, just my question is more around expectations for Dan. Give us an idea of what do you expect to see change on the sales force and what are sort of his mandate kind of out of the box?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","This is Bill. His initial mandate is going to be to fully integrate the Telx Equicity (59:14) and Digital sales teams and create the appropriate efficiencies there, and then develop the right go-to-market, working off of what the team has developed, and then further to push on the partners and alliances front.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So with that, if we were to see better growth than sort of what the Street has modeled next year, would that entail hiring more sales people, and what would have to \u2013 what would change to see better than Street growth next year?","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","So Dan hasn't come on board yet, so I'm not going to give him his budget whether it's a lower head count or a higher head count, and we haven't talked revenues yet either. So he starts next week. So, I think, we're premature there.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein, CEO for any closing remarks.","William Stein - Digital Realty Trust, Inc.","Thanks, Ed. I would like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 19. We had another very productive quarter characterized by solid execution, against our strategic plan.","We continue to extend our global footprint with the closing of the European portfolio acquisition. We further enhanced our product offerings with the announcement of the launch of our service exchange. We're also continuing to deliver outsized growth in AFFO per share. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the proceeds from asset sales and a successful forward equity offering used to redeem high coupon preferred equity and secured debt.","In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan.

Following their remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Questions will be limited to one per caller to manage it in a timely manner. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue. ","I'll now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael F. Foust","Great. Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call,  everyone. I will begin my remarks today with an overview of our operating results, followed by a brief review of our markets and current acquisition and development activities. Following my prepared comments, Bill Stein will go through our financial results. ","Following our record leasing results in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a relatively modest first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. As I have previously mentioned, our leasing activity tends to be seasonal with stronger results often occurring later in the year. During the quarter, we signed 94,000 square feet of Turn-Key space at an average lease rate of $163 per square foot, with an average rate for U.S. Turn-Key leases at $136 per square foot. Over the past 5 quarters, average rental rates per square foot for Turn-Key in the U.S. have ranged from between $122 to $176 per square foot. ","Rental rates have historically varied by building and by market and by customer application. Therefore, we do not feel that the sample size of lease in the first quarter indicates a Turn-Key in overall Turn-Key lease rates. ","Excluding colocation, the average term for leases signed in the first quarter for Datacenter space was 148 months or 12.7 years, exceeding our average range of 7 to 10 years for the second straight quarter. ","Other leasing highlights during the quarter include a signed lease for an entire 47,000 square foot building at our Datacenter Park Dallas property in Dallas, which continues to be a very good market for us. The building was leased on a PBB basis to a leading information management and data security company. ","On the West Coast, we signed new leases in San Francisco and Los Angeles with one of our top 10 customers, supporting the growth of their colocation interconnection business. ","In London, we continued to see steep demand with 2 new leases signed at our Redhill facility, where we are now nearly fully leased. In addition, we're on track to complete the first phase of the redevelopment of our Chessington property later this year in suburban London. ","In Asia-Pacific, we signed 2 new leases at our Singapore property with a strong funnel of prospects for the balance of the building. We've also signed our first lease in Hong Kong and plan to issue a press release on this in the coming weeks. ","In addition to the current Build-to-Suit projects underway, we're actively pursuing a number of new opportunities. Because of their size and complexity, the timing in these deals tend to be lumpy. Leveraging our experience in size selection acquisitions, building design and construction management, our dedicated Build-to-Suit team is focused on working closely with prospective customers to create tailored data center solution to meet their specific requirements. ","We're also expanding our co-location offering in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities. Our goal is to convert underutilized space and facilities where we believe we can achieve a higher ROI if converted to co-location space. This space is typically located in buildings and markets that are currently under-served. ","Turning to our lease renewal activity. We're quite pleased with our continued success, signing over 264,000 square feet of space for an average of 2% increase in GAAP rents. ","Rentals included approximately 78,000 square feet of Turn-Key space, an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $186. This compares to the $187 per square foot for the expiring leases. The small $1 per square foot decrease was primarily driven by 2 leases that renewed at a property we acquired in 2010 that had in place above market rents. The new rates yield very attractive returns on this asset. ","We also renewed approximately 120,000 square feet of Powered Base Building space at rates that increased by 20.5% on a GAAP basis. ","Overall, tenant retention remains very high. On a square foot basis, 95% of expiring Turn-Key space renewed in the first quarter. On a revenue basis, Turn-Key leases renewed at approximately 96% of GAAP, with an average lease term of 104 months. Again, on a square foot basis, 100% of expiring Powered Base Building leases renewed in the quarter at over 120% of GAAP rents, with an average lease term of 82 months. ","Portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 94.8% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we added over 1 million square feet of space to the portfolio through our acquisitions and development programs, which includes 70 PODs in Singapore and new space in Phoenix, arguably 2 of our strongest markets for new prospects, along with Dallas. ","Same-store occupancy was relatively unchanged at 94.4% compared to 94.6% in the fourth quarter. First quarter same-store NOI increased to $176.5 million, up 2.4% from $172.4 million in the previous quarter. Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for noncash purchase accounting adjustments, was $159.7 million in the first quarter, up 2.4% from $155.9 million in the third quarter. ","We continue to track over 2 million square feet of prospective data center demand across our active markets. ","Along with positive absorption, our pipeline is consistent with a steady stream of new customer requirements we see coming to the market. Many of these requirements come from customers new to DLR. While the sales cycle with the new customer is typically longer, the investment time in securing new logos has historically proved significant -- provided us with significant long-term growth opportunity for our businesses. Many of these new customers end up expanding in multiple locations with us. ","I will now briefly run through some of the supply\/demand statistics we're tracking in a few of our major U.S. markets, which we received the most questions. As you know, our strategy is to maintain a disciplined approach to managing inventory market-by-market by utilizing our flexible POD Architecture that's designed to deliver data center space in approximately 1 to 2-megawatt increments. This enabled us to meet customer just-in-time requirements across our global portfolio while limiting our financial exposure in any one market. ","Moving east to west. In the New York, New Jersey Metro, we're tracking nearly 41 million megawatts of potential demand. That's an increase of 10 megawatts from what we were tracking last quarter. We believe this reflects pent-up demand from financial services, as well as system integrators and managed services cloud providers that support the financial vertical. As a matter of fact, the financial vertical represents over 18% of our average base rents today. This compares with approximately 25.8 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or currently under construction in the market. ","At DLR New Jersey\/New York exposure buildout space remains relatively small with 3 Turn-Key PODs, about 3.5 megawatts currently available. However, we do have the capability to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory that we're poised to develop with entitlements. ","In Northern Virginia, we're tracking approximately 37.7 megawatts of current potential demand. This compares to approximately 35.9 megawatts of available supply that's either built out or under construction. In our view, Northern Virginia's currently the most comparative market in the country. As a result, we're seeing some downward pressure on rent in that area. Again, we have a very manageable current exposure in this market with 3.9 megawatts of available built out supply in the digital portfolio. ","As I mentioned earlier, Dallas continues to be a very active market for us, limited available built out supply. We've identified approximately 21.2 megawatts of demand compared to about 8.7 megawatts of new built out supply. ","Finally, in Silicon Valley, we're currently tracking 12.8 megawatts of demand, which is up significantly from the 3.6 megawatts we discussed in our last call. This increase is consistent with our experience with the growth of IT and Internet enterprise customers in the Valley, which can be dramatic and difficult to predict. Our exposure at present is very manageable with just under 4 megawatts of available supply, including 3.5 megawatts we have under construction currently. ","Turning to our acquisitions program. We acquired the large Convergence data center and office campus in Lewisville, Texas and the DFW Metroplex during the quarter. This property consists of over 819,000 square feet, it's 99% leased and it presents attractive features and new development potential with excess entitled land and utility substation under its construction. ","We also announced earlier this month that we are under contract to acquire our first property in Hong Kong, a very robust yet quite under-served global market. And we're doing this with our joint venture partner, Savvis. We plan to begin construction following the closing of the acquisition expected to occur in June with completion of the first PODs expected early in the second quarter of 2013. ","We have a strong pipeline of additional acquisitions. They're in various stages of negotiation for both income-producing, as well as development properties. ","As you know, our development program is a very important component of our business that fills much of our growth. During the first quarter, we completed approximately 153,000 square feet of turnkey facilities with over 35% pre-leased and 53,000 square feet of Powered Base Building that was 100% leased. ","At quarter-end, we are under construction on turnkey space, totaling about 485,000 square feet. This includes 326,000 square feet in the U.S., 44,000 square feet in Europe and approximately 114,000 square feet in Singapore and Australia. Approximately 25% of this space-under-construction's pre-leased. ","For Powered Base Building space, we're under construction at about 638,000 square feet, including 503,000 square feet in the U.S., 48,000 square feet in Asia-Pac and 88,000 square feet under construction in Europe, which includes the new Chessington redevelopment property in London that we acquired in third quarter of 2011. ","Lastly, we had approximately 275,000 square feet of Build-to-Suit space under construction in the U.S., which is 100% pre-leased. ","Including the preconstruction work in common area building improvements, the total construction work-in-progress invested in the first quarter was $305 million. The estimated cost to complete ongoing March 31 work-in-progress was $447 million. ","This concludes my prepared remarks. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Stein.","A. William Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our financial strategy and capital markets activity and then discuss our financial performance and guidance. ","Last week, we announced the closing of a USD $750 million equivalent unsecured multicurrency term loan, which can be increased by $100 million to $850 million. It matures in April 2017 and includes the ability to borrow in U.S. dollar, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Hong Kong dollar, as well as euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen denominations. ","We accessed the bank term loan markets to take advantage of attractive 5-year borrowing interest rates and to place debt on foreign subsidiaries, which allows us to naturally hedge our growing international balance sheet. In line with our overall capital strategy, the term loan also enhances our financial flexibility to accommodate our growing global investment program and to provide immediate liquidity for potential acquisitions. ","We've made an initial draw of USD $525 million equivalent to U.S. dollars, Singapore and Australian dollars, as well as British pound sterling and euros, and have up to 90 days to draw the remaining $225 million. Over the next several months, we expect to execute interest rate swaps to hedge at least half of our total exposure. ","Including the term loan, year-to-date, we've raised nearly $989 million of new capital. Additional financings include the 6 5\/8 series cumulative redeemable preferred stock offering of 7.3 million shares in April, raising net proceeds of $175.8 million, which is the lowest yielding perpetual preferred stock that the company has ever issued, and the issuance of 957,000 shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity distribution program, with net proceeds totaling $262.7 million at an average price of $66.19. ","All of these shares were issued in January, prior to our last earnings call. We currently have approximately $54 million of availability remaining on the ATM program. ","We have $1.7 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes $68 million in short-term investments, funds that can be drawn on our global revolving credit facility and the delayed draw on the term loan. If these liquidity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance, with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities of Prudential Shelf Facility and other unsecured debt. ","During the quarter, we paid up 2 European secured loans totaling $73.4 million. We have $79.5 million of remaining principal amortization and debt maturities in 2012. This includes a $16 million secured loan that we expect to retire this week, as well as a $52.8 million secured loan that we expect to retire in September. In 2013, we have  $247.6 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities unsecured debt, which we plan to retire with proceeds from the revolver. These activities are consistent with our practice of lowering overall cost of debt. ","As of the end of the day yesterday, the balance on our $1.5 billion global revolving credit facility was $20.7 million, and we held unrestricted cash of $68 million. ","Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 4.7x at quarter-end, up from 4.4x at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Pro forma for the recently issued preferred equity net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 4.6x. This increase is due to a higher level of borrowings on our global credit facility. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio increased to 3.4x at the end of the first quarter compared to 3.2x in the previous quarter. ","Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. All per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release, first quarter 2000 (sic) [2012] FFO was $1.06 per share, up 3.9% from the fourth quarter 2011 and first quarter 2011 of $1.02 per share. ","Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, first quarter 2012 core FFO was $677,000 higher than reported FFO or essentially unchanged at $1.06 per share. This reflects a 2.9% increase from fourth quarter 2011 core FFO of $1.03 per share. ","Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, for the first quarter of 2012 was $102.8 million, up over 8% from $94.9 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the first quarter of 2012 was 82.8%, up from 81.9% the last quarter. ","Adjusted EBITDA at quarter-end of $172 million grew by 5% from $163.6 million last quarter and by 15% from $150.1 million in the first quarter of 2011. ","Turning now to the income statement. Net operating income increased by $9.5 million to $182.6 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $173.1 million last quarter. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions. As we discussed on our last quarter, fourth quarter 2011 property taxes included a favorable tax assessment, a portion of which was passed on to tenants. ","G&A increased by 14.4% to $14.3 million in the first quarter compared to $12.5 million last quarter, primarily due to 2011 year-end accrual adjustments of $1.4 million, which lowered the fourth quarter 2011 run rate. ","Tax expense was $721,000 in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a tax benefit in the previous quarter of $1.2 million. This increase of $1.9 million was primarily due to the fourth quarter true-up of about $1.8 million of deferred taxes relating to foreign operations and taxable REIT subsidiary activities. ","Finally, we are not revising our 2012 FFO guidance range of $4.34 to $4.40, or its underlying assumptions. ","While we do not give quarterly guidance, I would like to remind you that I discussed at our Investor Day in January that we expect growth in 2012 recognized revenue, NOI and FFO resulting from new leasing to be back-end loaded in the year. Also, because of the success of our recent term loan and the preferred equity offering, we do not expect to issue additional capital in 2012. Most of our acquisitions volume exceeds our current guidance assumption of $300 million to $400 million. ","Our 2012 outlook remains positive. A combination of our leasing funnel, investment opportunities and access to attractively priced capital make us well positioned to capture a variety of market opportunities and we are tracking worldwide in order to increase shareholder value. ","We look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and quarters ahead. ","This concludes our formal remarks. Mike and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm just -- I wanted to follow up on the bit about acquisitions in the pipeline. Mike, it sounds like it's strong both on the income side and otherwise. I'm curious if you would have interest at the enterprise level. It's been telegraphed that Cincinnati Bell is looking to monetize CyrusOne, and I know it's in different markets. I'm wondering if that would even be on the radar for you guys?","Michael F. Foust","Well, we're always looking at opportunities both on individual assets, portfolio, corporate levels. So we're definitely open to any opportunity. Our understanding is that they're pursuing an IPO for the CyrusOne division, so we'll just have to see how that plays out.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up, any -- can you maybe just give us a little bit of color on the recent departure of the Head of Sales and has -- there's been any disruption in leasing at all as a result of sort of that transition?","Michael F. Foust","No, no disruption at all. Yes, we're fortunate that we have a very strong team of leaders and -- in place, as well as the -- we have the local sales team and our listing brokers and asset managers who all work together. So we don't expect to skip a beat in that regard. I mean, we hate to see Brent leave, great guy. But the organization moves on because we have built a very deep organization here.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Did he have a non-compete?","Michael F. Foust","No.","A. William Stein","Non-compete aren't enforceable in California, Jordan. It's a matter of public policy.","Michael F. Foust","And law.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Caton, Morgan Stanley.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a question on the redevelopment pipeline, 2 parter. First, in Boston, you started -- as you mentioned last time that you're expanding your Needham project. Can you give us more detail on that? And then second, you had talked about wanting to expand activities in Chicago on the last call as well, and wondered if you're pursuing development or redevelopment opportunities that may show up in the future or is that going to be more like an acquisition?","Michael F. Foust","Sure, yes. The Needham site is underway. In fact, I was just out there week before last and we're going full bore. I believe we'll be delivering somewhere approximately 150,000 square feet of new construction in that facility and that will nicely augment the existing operating site there in Needham. So we're very excited about that market. And in Chicago, we're definitely pursuing opportunities there to create more product for the customer demand that we're seeing in the Chicago market, so we are actively pursuing development opportunities in that area.","Chris Caton - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just to follow-up on Boston, what type of customer verticals are you servicing in Needham? And is there anything specific or is it general?","Michael F. Foust","Boston is a good regional market. So the great majority of your demand is coming from New England and Boston region. So it's financial services, including large money managers, banks, life companies, healthcare -- you have such a strong healthcare market in that area -- and other corporate headquarter types in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Hilmoe, UBS.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, just given the capital plan in terms of acquisitions and development, can you talk a little bit about where you expect the focus to be over the next few years, beyond what's in the current pipeline whether it's domestic, overseas? And kind of what you expect the portfolio to look like kind of on a pro forma basis?","Michael F. Foust","Well, we'll continue to focus on a combination deploying capital. It's difficult to look out beyond the next 24 months specifically, but certainly, the major markets in the U.S. where we're seeing continued demand, and that would be places like New Jersey, Dallas, Phoenix, Bay Area, Boston, Chicago -- I mean, these are all the, among others, the important markets for us. So I think you'll continue to see the majority of growth because the United States is so large with so many markets. But you'll see increased volumes certainly in Asia-Pac. We're quite excited about the Australian markets we're in: Sydney and Melbourne. We think Singapore has very good long-term potential for us. We think Hong Kong has very long-term potential for us. So I think you'll see us deploying significant capital in those areas. And we'll selectively continue participating in the major markets in Europe and especially London, Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam in particular will continue to be areas of focus for us.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And can you quickly -- can you just give the cash release in spreads and assigned turnkey notes in the quarter?","Michael F. Foust","We've been focusing on the GAAP and we want to be consistent and keep giving out the GAAP numbers, but I don't have the cash at my fingertips.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman, Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman","It's Manny here with Michael. Just a couple of questions for you. In Hong Kong, I know previously you had discussed buying in-place assets and now you've gone in this JV to do a development, just wondering if that's a change in strategy or just taking the opportunity do something with Savvis?","Michael F. Foust","No, this is actually exactly the strategy we've been pursuing to find existing building that has the power and the fiber available that we could redevelop as data center space. So actually this is -- what we've been pursuing for the last couple of years defined that kind of an asset would be really adaptable for data center use. And the park that we're in is really attractive place because of the significant amount of power that's available and the tremendous fiber access and other corporate data centers, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, et cetera. So it's really a very attractive location and what we've had our eye on for some time.","Emmanuel Korchman","Okay. And then turning to the U.S. for a second, if we look at the supply that you have in any given market, how would you classify that SME? Is it more sensitive to price and if you price it correctly you have a tenant that would come in and take in any of that space or is it really a demand -- a trigger thing from the tenant where if they need the space they'll come and pay whatever price you're asking for?","Michael F. Foust","Well, I wouldn't say -- I'd say it's kind of customer demand is specific to markets. So in different markets, no surprise New York\/New Jersey is very heavily financial service oriented. Silicon Valley is very tech, social networking oriented. Dallas, you've got a wide range of corporate enterprise, a number of different verticals, as well as IT services in there. So it really just depends on the particular market and the mix of customer demand. And then, pricing is generally driven by supply and demand dynamics and relationships.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers, RBC Market.","David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for you on the colocation business. With regard to your 2012 Investor Day presentation, you had a slide in there, I think, that said you wanted to double the size of colo from 5% to 10% of revenues. Can you kind of talk about why you're making that push into that side of the business? How far along that is and when that hurdle is to be reached? And then, I guess, the second question along with those lines would be, are you doing this yourselves? Are you pushing into the interconnect business or this is just another way to kind of create space for resellers in your portfolio?","Michael F. Foust","Well, it's really an opportunity for us to create value at the asset level in existing Internet gateway buildings that employ the high connectivity with having many networks and ISPs and other assets that we think blend themselves well for the colocation. The smaller footprint business -- it's really, we look at it kind of the spectrum of size of customer requirements, maybe a big company, but in a particular geography, they may need a small footprint. We have space available that we think we can add a lot of value on a property level by building it out and leasing to the smaller footprint requirements. So it's really an asset-driven strategy. And being able to utilize our in-place operating staff, because we do have folks that are operating these facilities and doing a very good job of it. So kind of piggybacking on the business we have now which if you look at total gross revenues of our current colo business, it's about $55 million, and we'd like to see that double in 3 to 4 years. That may be a little ambitious, but I think with the space we have available, it's something that we can achieve in. And the -- again, the margins are very good because they are smaller footprint deals.","David Rodgers - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Would these be add-on spaces to Telex or somebody else who manages that gateway site within the larger facility or were you guys pushing ahead and do this on your own? And will we see you get into more interconnect business in the future?","Michael F. Foust","Well, the colo space that we refer to is space that we're managing and leasing ourselves. We've pretty much given other folks, who are large customers of ours, first crack at the space. And more often than not, if folks -- other service providers want the space, we're happy to lease it to them more on a wholesale basis, if you will. But it's phased out that we see we could -- that follow right now that we can add a lot of value with and add value at the asset level. The interconnect business, it's probably something we'll continue to do in certain locations where we don't have a Telex meet-me-room setup, but it's really more focusing on space power warm hands and being more network neutral on the network side.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow, Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. Mike, could you talk about the sensitivity on the demand side in Europe, given the economic issues they're having there?","Michael F. Foust","Sure. I mean, we're certainly not seeing as much demand as we're seeing in, generally, in the U.S. markets and the Asia-Pac markets we're in. But I don't want to give the impression that nothing's going on. I think in markets like London and Amsterdam, we're going to see continued good demand requirements. Amsterdam is such a big network location and London with corporate and financial services, it's pretty robust. I mean, we're seeing a lot of demand in London right now, and probably almost 32 megawatts of potential demand. Even in Paris, we're seeing requirements out there, different stages of purchasing of between 12 and 13 megawatts. So it's certainly not totally quiet. So we'll continue to be very focused and bringing on space, utilizing our POD Architecture so we don't get ahead of demand with supply. And I think we're very well positioned to nab, hopefully, more than our fair share of those requirements. We'll be very incremental as we bring new space on in London, Paris and Dublin. And we are looking for another project in Amsterdam because we're fully leased in that market.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then at your Analyst Day, you talked about potentially entering Latin America, following your customers, if you will. Any update on that opportunity?","Michael F. Foust","We are doing some consulting work with our digital design services in Mexico City with a customer on a development that they're doing. And we're definitely only in conversation mode regarding Brazil, although that continues to be an intriguing opportunity and what I think we will explore in more earnest here this year. Nothing to announce at this stage.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then Bill, if I can ask you one question, we all heard you at the Analyst Day at the back-end loaded year. I think consensus is $1.17 for the fourth quarter. Do you have any commentary on that? Obviously, it's important as we start thinking about '13.","A. William Stein","I mean, I think, we don't give -- as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. I'd say, given the slope of the growth in the year, the $1.17 would be right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] the acquisition pipeline a little bit if you could just -- if you could give some color on -- if most of that is focused internationally or domestically, that would be helpful.","Michael F. Foust","For income properties, it's primarily U.S. And so that's what we're seeing most of the prospects for us for income acquisitions.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then also the development -- the joint venture in Hong Kong, any sense -- if we could get a -- just a better sense of pricing, what kind of development yields you expect and just how much is spent on it and how much it actually cost to develop it out?","Michael F. Foust","We're not prepared to give out that information at this point, partially for competitive reasons and as well as we do have a partner in this, especially for competitive reasons. We don't want to give out those kind of metrics.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then, thanks for your commentary on Northern Virginia and pricing in that market. Could you give us a sense on what you're seeing in New Jersey and Santa Clara pricing-wise?","Michael F. Foust","I'd say New Jersey and Santa Clara are holding pretty steady. And those we did see in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley, a decline in the second half of last year. I think it's holding steady at those levels. Definitely in Virginia, with a couple of players choosing to be very aggressive on lease rates, that's probably the biggest decline that we've seen. We've been fortunate. I mean, we've been working to meet the market and still maintain double-digit yields on our investments by and large.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just one more quick question. With a lot of the talk around the Pacific Northwest becoming a hotter data center market, how do you think of that relative to the current assets you own and whether that's going to create incremental competition on a going forward basis?","Michael F. Foust","We've been very active in Seattle and expanding our portfolio there with our new developments and continue to build out the existing Westin Building as well with our partner, Price Properties. And they're fabulous partners. So we're really excited in looking at other opportunities working with them to expand the Seattle footprint. And we're currently underway -- well underway on a Build-to-Suit for NetApp in Hillsborough, Oregon which is suburban Portland, which is another very attractive submarket for corporate data center users. So we'll continue to look at that Greater Portland area as well. Potentially, to do some, maybe even do some, spective element and continue on with the Seattle business which continues to expand.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then Silicon Valley, you gave us the typical stats of the demand you're tracking and your current inventory in the market, but you didn't give us a sense of what market supply is.","Michael F. Foust","Yes, let's see. I think Silicon Valley, we're looking at a current supply under construction of either existing or under construction around 20 megawatts perhaps. I'd have to -- I don't have my notes in front of me on that one offhand.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'll follow up offline on that one. And then just -- I'm sorry, just one more question. Build-to-Suit, just kind of curious what your outlook is at this point whether you're still kind of seeing a strong demand for that?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, we are seeing good demand. These are a little bit trickier opportunities. And tricky, I mean, because they take a lot of face-to-face planning work with the customers because these are more customized solutions, sometimes including site selection and acquisition as well. So I think this is going to be -- continue to be a growing area for us because we're so uniquely positioned with our site selection, our design, our project management our supply chain management. So it's hard for me to put a number on it like what percentage of our overall growth is going to represent, but they do tend to be larger requirements. So I think in 2013 and 2014, we'll definitely see the impact of that work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on back to the acquisition pipeline, particularly the income-producing. In the past you've talked about sort of the pipeline in a dollar terms, in terms of what you're tracking, is that something that you can talk about here?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, I mean I think we're looking at various phases of prospecting probably around $750 million of suspect deals. Like I said, they're in various stages of review. And that's both income and for development projects.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like those are probably smaller -- not really portfolios you're looking at, is that correct?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, tend to be one-off individual deals.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Bill, maybe on the term loan, you said I think 50% of it you'd look to fix on a -- via swaps. Can you just talk about what your expectations would be if you were to fix that today, what kind of rates you'd get?","A. William Stein","I actually said at least 50%. The swap rate is very -- fair bit by currency. So the U.S. dollar would swap basically mid-2s. In fact, just about everything swaps mid- to high-2s. Well, mostly mid-2s, except for the Aussie dollar which would swap mid-5s.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- sorry, I'm bouncing about around a little bit here -- on the colo discussion. To get to the 10% over time and your doubling of the revenues from where you are today, do see yourself having the infrastructure today to do that or do you need to staff up to get to those levels?","Michael F. Foust","We have the great majority of that staff in place because, well, these are buildings we're already operating. So we can utilize a lot of that facility staff. And so we've been adding in terms of management, as well as leasing and marketing. Those are the main areas that we've been adding to the staffing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich, Green Street Advisers.","Lukas Hartwich - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Mike, this is a question for you. I'm just curious how competitive you think your older spaces? Is there still demand for lower power density product or does that stuff just get redeveloped?","Michael F. Foust","Well, I think you're making an assumption that's necessarily lower power density, which isn't the case relative to new product. So the power densities are -- tend not to be an issue. And I think you see on our renewals that we're renewing a very high percentage. And typically, the power -- what we label as Powered Base Building renewals because that's where the customers put in the improvements have been renewing over the last couple of years at least in the high-90s percent. I think this quarter was 100% at 20% uplift in overall rent. So as you see by the renewal activity, that continues to be very valuable space.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach, ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, I guess 2 related questions on balance sheet. First, you mentioned that you won't need any new capital this year, but given where unsecured debt rates are when your stock is trading on an applied cap rate basis, I guess, how do you think about maybe some earnings dilution versus locking in long-term financing? And second, given the spread between your stock price and\/or I think most people have your NAV, why not accelerate the ATM issuance, the kind of capture that spread will lock in the financing?","A. William Stein","George, right now, we're effectively sitting on cash. We have still $220 million, $230 million to draw on the term loan. So we're going to take that down over the next 90 days, which is what the term loan provides for. As far as the long-term market is concerned, the rates are certainly attractive. And our strategy there is consider a swap lock of out, probably, 12 months and that would really at least for a portion of our long-term financing needs in the first quarter of next year. So basically lock in at today's treasury. We can't hedge the spread but we can hedge the -- against the treasury.  I think on the equity, we'll be opportunistic. So there is no need to issue equity, and that's the point I want to make. If we exceed our acquisition targets, it would raise equity so that the acquisition is leveraged neutral, and it may make sense to issue some equity as well. But I'm not going to issue equity and just put the cash on the balance sheet.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess I was thinking more in terms of not drawing down as much in the term loan, just given with the stock kind of the 6s on an applied basis, does that sort of make sense in a long-term basis?","A. William Stein","We really have to take the term loan within 90 days. That's how it's structured -- the balance of it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Feldman, Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually Jeff Spector. Just a question on the seasonality that you talked about at the beginning of the call. Can you just explain again how that impacts the new leased rents on the turnkey for the quarter?","Michael F. Foust","Well, it's kind of a more on a timing basis and a market basis. So these rates can vary pretty widely by market. And in terms of the overall volume, it's timing, and activities generally seems to be a little more back-end loaded for us as in terms of new signings. And the lease rates are going to vary pretty considerably market by market. And the type of asset as well and the type of applications, whether it's a smaller footprint for a very dense trading or whether it's a more typical power density for more general corporate applications.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so, does that mean that the development yields are still intact even though, let's say, that new lease rent was slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter?","Michael F. Foust","I think we're definitely in that 11 to 13 range domestically for stabilized returns, higher internationally. So it's -- our yields are good, very good.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just focusing a little bit more on that. Can you give us any additional information since the quarter-end? Anything new that have surprised you to give us a little bit more comfort that the first quarter was just seasonal? I mean, we've seen results from some of your peers today and we saw some strong numbers in the data center industry. Is there anything you've seen since the quarter-end to give us some additional comfort?","Michael F. Foust","Well, since the quarter ended like 3 weeks ago, but we are seeing good activity. And the leasing -- if you look at -- you can't -- the activity is very good. And you can't just separate out the first quarter from the fourth quarter. It's -- we're seeing a trend with very good activity over the last 4 quarters. So I think if you look in totality, the trajectory is good and we're in a number of different markets. So having the diversity of product and customer verticals, I think, will definitely benefit our shareholders.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And this is Jamie. So the -- your JV with Savvis in Hong Kong, now we were a couple of quarters into their acquisition by CenturyLink, is there anything different in that structure now that, that's a combined company or any kind of different way that they're working with you guys than when they were on their own?","Michael F. Foust","No. I mean, they're very good customer, obviously, of ours and along with other folks. But they are combined with the Savvis and Qwest combination in the CenturyLink, they're our largest customer. And we continue to look at opportunities with them across U.S. and in some of these international location sites. I wouldn't say this represents a different trend other than continue to, hopefully, be able to be a good partner and help them expand their footprint domestically, as well as internationally.","James C. Feldman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just one final detailed question on the colocation leases you said that they're much longer now than they used to be. Is there a reason for that? Anything we should think about when we see that?","Michael F. Foust","Well, I think what we're saying, the non-colocation leases continue to be very long-term. I believe we're well over 10 years, and so I think for the larger footprint leases, we continue to see a good term. So tenants are committing to long-term. So we like that because we think that reflects a higher asset value and in very predictable cash flow stream, earnings stream from our asset base.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Mike Foust for closing remarks. ","[Technical Difficulty] ","Sir, please go ahead with the closing remarks. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Foust.","Michael F. Foust","Yes, sorry for the telecom glitch there. Looks like we had a crossed line. But, I definitely appreciate everybody's time and good questions today.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","John Stewart","Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. The speakers on today\u2019s call will be CEO Mike Foust and CFO and Chief Investment Officer, Bill Stein; Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski is also here with us and will be available for Q&A.","In addition to the press release and supplemental disclosure package we put out yesterday, we\u2019ve also posted a presentation to the Investors section of our website to accompany management\u2019s prepared remarks. You\u2019re welcome to download the presentation and follow along throughout the call.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that management may make forward-looking statements on this call. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Forward-looking statements include statements related to future financial and other results, including 2014 guidance and the underlying assumptions. For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will also contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations of such non-GAAP items and reconciliations to net income are contained in our supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website at digitalrealty.com. Management\u2019s prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. Once again, questions will be limited to two per caller and if you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back in the queue.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike Foust.","Mike Foust","Great. Thank you very much John and welcome to the call everyone. As we discussed at our Investor Day last November, driving improved return on invested capital, especially to the lease up of existing inventory is the top priority across our organization. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we made very good headway in that front during the fourth quarter.","As you can see on the first page of our presentation, we achieved record lease signings in the fourth quarter which also propelled the full year total for 2013 to our best year ever. In addition, we made good progress and we absorbed -- absorbing 12 of the 54 megawatts of finished turn-key inventory we had on hand at Investor Day last November.","We\u2019re also pleased by the higher than anticipated contribution from the mid-market and colocation sales initiatives. We signed $7.7 million of annualized GAAP colocation revenue during the fourth quarter which is likewise a record high quarter for this segment. We don\u2019t believe that the strong fourth quarter volume was an anomaly as our mid-market sales team is ramping up with management sales directors now in place. We\u2019re encouraged by the early results and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic on the prospects for repeat performances in the quarters ahead.","As you can see from the numbers at the bottom of page 2, base rents for our Turn-Key Flex product were lower than they had been in the recent quarters. However, this is primarily a function of market mix and was not due to rental rate erosion during the fourth quarter. Specifically fourth quarter leasing activity was heavily skewed by large cloud requirements in Ashburn, Virginia and in Dallas Richardson, Texas where absolute rent levels are lower than our global markets in Europe and Asia-Pac and elsewhere in the U.S. Most importantly from my perspective, the rents achieved during the fourth quarter represented consistent, very attractive returns in our invested capital in these markets.","Turning now to page 3, affirming of market rents was also apparent in our re-leasing spreads on renewal leases signed during the quarter. Cash year one rents and Turn-Key Flex and colo renewal leases rolled down only a little less than 1% and the overall mark-to-market was up over 3%, driven by another strong quarter of significantly positive cash re-leasing spreads and our Powered-Base Building products. This increase included but not exclusive to the renewal several of large long-term [Econex] leases. Overall, PBB lease renewals increased by 27% on a cash basis and fully 51% on a GAAP basis, reflecting long term growing cash flow for these leases.","In addition to signings, lease commencements were also healthy. The fourth quarter was our third best commencement quarter ever. And as you can see from the chart, at the bottom right of page 4, the weighted average GAAP between signing and commencement of these leases was only just over 5 months.","Moving onto page 5, the backlog of signed leases translates to an incremental $28 million of GAAP NOI in 2014, with an additional $48 million beyond that. We would remind you that this solid backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced represents contractual obligations for future rental revenue, setting stage for healthy growth and cash flows over the intermediate term.","Clearly leasing momentum picked up in the second half of the year. That momentum is carried forward into the first quarter, although slowed down a bit from the rapid pace in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about the first quarter leasing activity, particularly based on deals in the final stages of our sales process. But as typically the case, signings do appear to be back end loaded towards the end of the quarter. Overall, our team is engaged with more leased prospects than ever, representing over $3 million rentable square feet of 2014 requirements.","Now, turn to some of the demand drivers. In addition to the success of the mid-market and colocation initiatives, large scale cloud deployments represented a significant portion of our fourth quarter leasing activity as well as demand in 2014 and above. Cloud infrastructure and applications are major data center demand drivers as represented here on page six of our presentation. And these cloud requirements accounted for over 60% of 2013 lease signings. IBM Software is a prime example. And many of you have seen them in January, IBM announced plans to spend $1.2 billion to open 15 new cloud data centers worldwide. We are working with IBM Software to ensure that we remain their trusted data center partner for much of their global expansion needs.","As you can see from the top tenants\u2019 table, in our supplemental package that IBM is now our second largest tenant, representing over 5.5% of total revenues. We believe that we have a portfolio best capable of supporting IBM\u2019s cloud platform on a global scale, much as we have with software over the past several years of their rapid growth.","Turning now to supply, the data center brokerage practice at Avison Young recently reported that there was 20% less wholesale data center inventory available for immediate occupancy or scheduled to be delivered by the end of the first quarter relative to this time last year.","It is certainly consistent with our experience and you can see from the charts on pages seven and eight that new supply remains relatively muted in most major markets across the U.S. One change of note in the past 90 days is that 13 megawatts of Yahoo sublease space in Northern Virginia not in digital data centers has been confirmed as available and it has been reflected as such in our charts.","We have seen several recent announcements of potential competitive starts in Northern Virginia and we are keeping watchful eye on the supply and demand dynamic in that market. But the fact is that Ashburn is a national market; it accounted for over 25% of our total leasing [environment] in 2013 and due to our continued leasing success in Northern Virginia it is a market where we continue to strategically invest our capital. We have a significant pipeline of good customers in that market today.","I\u2019d like to turn to compensation. Finally before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to address a couple of changes to our programs. First of all, we recently restructured sales compensation program to more optimally incentivize the sales force. Specifically we\u2019ve emphasized a handful of simple controllable lever that will more closely align their variable compensation with our corporate objectives, particularly absorption of existing inventory, current year cash returns and lease term.","In addition, our Board of Directors recently approved a new long-term incentive compensation plan for senior management based entirely on total shareholder return relative to the RMS index, as shown here on page nine of the presentation.","In recognition of the comparably low starting point following last year\u2019s stock price performance, the hurdles have been set approximately 300 basis points higher than REIT peers with comparable relative return plans. In the entire (inaudible) we\u2019ll forfeited if we don\u2019t have lease performing line with the RMS over the three year measurement period.","Similar to the philosophy behind the sales compensation program, this plan has been designed to incentivize the creation of long-term shareholder value in the more closely aligned management\u2019s interest with those of shareholders.","With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill to take us through our financial performance and earnings outlook.","Bill Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. Starting with the balance sheet metrics on page 10, net debt to adjusted EBITDA was unchanged from third quarter at 5.4 times and fixed charge coverage improved slightly to a healthy 3.3 times.","The balance on our $2 million line of credit stood at $725 million at year-end. And subject to market conditions, we expect to term out most of our borrowings on the line of credit with the combination of preferred equity and to our long-term debt over the course of the year. It is not our intent to take an outside interest rate risk and we\u2019ve entered into a swap lock to hedge a potential U.S. bond offering midyear.","Turning now to page 11, our Board of Directors recently approved a 6% dividend increase. This is the 12th dividend increase since our IPO in 2004. And as you can see on the chart, we\u2019ve grown the per share dividend at a 14% compounded annual growth rate over that time.","As we noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and as outlined here on page 12, we acquired a datacenter in New Jersey for $35 million or $327 per square-foot late last year. The property is 100% triple net leased to an AA-rated financial services tenant with over nine years of remaining lease term.","The existing debt structure was complex and the seller was required to close by year-end. As a result, the seller chose to negotiate with the most credible buyer in the industry and we were able to structure transaction at a going in yield of roughly 100 basis points over market.","The going in cash cap rate was 9%, but we closed the project with the expectation that we would retire the existing mortgage and would incur a $4 million prepayment penalty which would run through P&L bringing the effective cap rate to 8%.","We\u2019ve subsequently reached an agreement with Prudential Real Estate Investors core fund to contribute the asset to the joint venture that we formed with them last fall. The terms will be similar to the existing structure and we expect to earn a healthy double-digit return on our 20% equity stake in the property. The joint venture will assume, but expects to prepay the in place debt and will incur the prepayment penalty. The contribution is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.","Given the current cost and availability of capital, we remain sharply focused on discipline capital allocation. At the same time this transaction is an example of how we will also continue to take advantage of opportunities that arise and are aligned with our core competencies to create value for shareholders with the judicious deployment of capital.","Turning now to earnings, our fourth quarter FFO per share came in $0.10 higher than the third quarter and the final 2013 outlook we\u2019ve provided on the last earnings call. As shown on page 13, the primary sources of upside include $0.04 per share due to lower financing cost, the delayed execution of both the preferred equity offering and the Sterling bond issuance that we previously expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2003 along with higher than expected capitalize interest.","It is important to note here that we\u2019re expecting a significant reduction in capitalized interest for 2014 as we slowdown our development spending and that is one of the reasons why the bid in the fourth quarter does not automatically fall through to higher guidance for 2014.","In addition, there is $0.02 of upside relative to our prior forecast due to lower bonus accruals. And this is evenly split between corporate G&A and property level compensation. In other words half was above the NOI line. Third one penny was due to other revenue and fee income which included a few small items such as a bit of development fee income and a small gain on the sale of the land parcel.","Four, we had one penny of tailwind from favorable foreign currency exchange rates during the fourth quarter. And last but not least, we have picked up a penny of savings at the property operating expense line, primarily from reduction in discretionary spending.","Our NOI margin excluding utility reimbursements were 74.2% in the fourth quarter and we expect a similar margin in the first quarter of 2014, as well as for the full year.","We are maintaining 2014 guidance that we provided in early January for core FFO per share of $4.75 to $4.90. On the heels of the beat in the fourth quarter, the year over FFO per share growth rate admittedly looks like, but I would remind you that it\u2019s largely a function of what we believe to be prudent balance sheet management along with the dilution from the joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors that we closed in the third quarter late last year, I am sorry, late in the third quarter last year.","I would also like to point out that the greatest variable for guidance is financing, the timing and the cost of financings that we plan for the year. Finally as part of our ongoing commitment to excellence and financial reporting, I am pleased to report that we have recently engaged former [AMB] Chief Information Officer (inaudible) separate and integrate our existing IT systems and design leading future data center business intelligence platform.","We expect to have more report on these initiatives as they progress over the next several years. Similarly we have made several enhancements to our quarterly supplemental package in direct response to feedback from the investment community on our disclosure practices.","Most notably we provided a detailed components of net asset value calculation on page 12 of the supp. We added a second table to our same-store analysis on page 16 showing a same capital calculation which is our attempt to provide you a better measure of the true organic growth since our traditional same-store disclosure included properties under redevelopment. We have also provided the IT load by market across the portfolio for the first time on page 24.","We have added a development lifecycle schedule on page 30 through 32 with market level detail on our development pipeline and finished inventory. We have added a comprehensive schedule on page 33 of our current and historical capital expenditures, reconciling our supplemental CapEx disclosure to the footnotes in the 10-K, as well as the statement of cash flows.","And last but not least, we have provided summary balance sheets and the income statements for our unconsolidated joint ventures which allow you to ride at our pro-rata share of unconsolidated JV debt as well as NOI.","We aim to continue to improve the transparency of our financial disclosures overtime. And we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in that process. This concludes today\u2019s prepared remarks.","I would now like to turn the call back to the operator and we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Emmanual Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanual Korchman - Citi","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just, Bill if we think about your 2014 guidance, I appreciate point on higher capitalized interest and conservative financing, but maybe you can help us bridge the gap sort of between your Investor Day presentation and the slide deck today, specifically if you look at slide 54 of the larger presentation slide five, today, it looks like your contractual NOI is much higher going into the year versus where you thought it would be. So I\u2019m surprised that that hasn\u2019t flown through the guidance? And similarly slide 53, which was the backlog, looks like it\u2019s increased significantly as well, if we look at slide four today and again that didn\u2019t seem to sort of flow into the topline may be you can help us sort of bridge that?","Bill Stein","So, NOI, we expect that Q1 NOI will be slightly higher than the run rate at the end of Q4, but the reason that hasn\u2019t flown through the bottom of FFO is because there is probably around $0.15 of financing costs, $0.15 per share.","Emmanual Korchman - Citi","For those already in guidance, so why should that change? What we know is your contractual NOI for \u201814 is up $71 million from Investor Day that\u2019s $0.05 and the NOI was higher in the fourth quarter than you thought. So the run rate is more aggressive. The financing, if anything got delayed and if anything is at better pricing, because rates are falling. And so how is guidance not moving up? We\u2019re just taking your numbers.","Mike Foust","Well, and this is Mike. And on one hand, the financings are occurring later than we had anticipated. And we\u2019re also being conservative in our outlook since it is early in the year.","Emmanual Korchman - Citi","So that should be accretive right, this is happening later to more accretive the guidance, your NOI is at least [$0.05] higher today than where you thought it was in the Investor Day? So, is the 475 to 490 just not a good range to use anymore or is it some negative offset that\u2019s happened that you are not telling us about?","Mike Foust","No, we expect leasing was higher on Investor Day than it is today obviously, because we leased up a lot of space in the fourth quarter.","Emmanual Korchman - Citi","Alright. Thanks guys.","Mike Foust","Thanks Emman.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk a little bit about the same store occupancy rate? I guess I\u2019m trying to put the 60 bps sequential decline and the 210 bps year-over-year decline in 2013 into some perspective given what was a record growth leasing year? So what should we be thinking about for our same store occupancy in 2014? And then as part of that, can you talk about the tenant retention ratio particularly for Turn-Key which I think was 79% last year and just talk a little bit about where you expect that to be?","Mike Foust","Sure. What\u2019s interesting to note that while we had a slight tick down in occupancy overall, if you look at the amount of space that\u2019s leased in the portfolio, it continues to go up every quarter. So we have had occupied square-footage of 19.8 million overall this fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter of 19.55 million. So we\u2019re bringing on more space and as that\u2019s inventory so that inventory goes into your denominator and then as that space gets leased up we will increase our percentage occupancy. So, the good news is we continue to have net positive leasing and we\u2019ve never had more occupied space than today. And so we expect that we will start catching up and continue to absorb that existing inventory we mentioned earlier and that will raise that occupancy.","Bill Stein","Hey Ross, I want to give you a little detail on the 60 bps in the 210 bps. So if you look quarter-over-quarter of the 60 bps, 100 bps of decline is due to delivering vacant inventory into our pool. There was plus 60 bps of increase in same store for new leasing and then there was a 30 bps decline due to terminations in the quarter. If you look at Q4 2013 versus Q4 2012 the 210 basis points we have an office building out in the East Bay which that\u2019s the Ardenwood property we\u2019ve had at base since our IPO. And we had a couple tenants leased in that period last year so we had 110 basis point decline in occupancy in 2013 because of that.","Again we had vacant inventory delivered that generated 40 bps decline and then terminations delivered 50 bps decline year-over-year 30 bps of that was data center and 20 bps of that was office or non-tech.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","And just on the retention ratio do you expect it to be roughly similar in 2014 as you saw in \u201813?","Bill Stein","Yes, over 90% in 2014 is what we expect right now.","Ross Nussbaum - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you, good morning. Wanted to just drill down a little bit on the middle market sales effort and what you are seeing vis-\u00e0-vis the sales funnel early in the year on that effort. It sounds like things are still good but maybe you could add some color around the number of new sales people that have been on ramped since the investor day and just what you are seeing momentum wise?","Matt Miszewski","Yes, this is -- thanks Jordan for the question. This is Matt Miszewski, happy to give you an update. We have added since the Q3 call all three of the mid market vice presidents and their staff and so we will have additions of the 15 sales assets in all of the relevant markets from a mid market perspective. So we see as though we are very close to fully staffed in the mid market space for 2014, again, we\u2019ve got a three year target in terms of hiring rents. So there will be some additional work to be done in 2015 and 2016. But we are very close to fully staffed on the mid market side from a staffing perspective.","In terms of total pipeline, I think that I am comfortable with a number of dynamics in the mid market space coming off of a very strong $7 million plus mid market performance in Q4, I am pretty satisfied with the positioning of the pipeline coming in to the last month of Q1 to be able to hit our goals from a mid market perspective and I am also very satisfied right now with where the rates are looking for both the mid market space as well as large enterprise space not just for this quarter but for the balance of fiscal year \u201814.","Bill Stein","","Well what\u2019s interesting about a lot of our customers in the mid market space is they are not necessarily taking one or two cabinets, they are taking 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 square feet at a crack. So it\u2019s we are ramping up very well because there are some really interesting requirements out there that this team is able to address in addition to our traditional large cloud and large enterprise and network customers. So we are very pleased on how far our prospect funnels built overall we\u2019ve gone from 2 billion square feet of real prospects to over 3 million rentable square feet as we stand today.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then a separate question, I appreciate the new disclosure I am just going to point you to page 16 on the same store capitals table. Is there any inside you could lend into the expense increases some of the lines moving around in there be it retail property operating versus RNM and property taxes just some big swings up and down any inside you could offer?","Mike Foust","","We are kind of looking at, I will let Bill jump in. And if you compare the 12 months ended on the RNM item, we are looking at 86 million versus 88 million. So it\u2019s very close.","","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Well I mean in the table below that Mike, the same capital one where you are looking at just same capital employed, it\u2019s -- so those are -- if you look at the 12 months, once our operating expenses are up 15%, RNM is down 16% and property taxes for the full year is the more surprising one, up 21%. What would be the driver behind some of this?","Mike Foust","","We discussed the property taxes on the last call, where we\u2019re actively pursuing against the assessments, appealed against the assessments, so what happened in both Texas and California, we believe that we\u2019re being charged twice for property tax and having property taxes included in the real estate tax. So not only are we -- assess value, so not only are we getting taxed twice, our tenants are getting taxed for the personal property and then us getting taxed again as real estate, which is not correct. And so, we are actively appealing those. But you have to pay them until you go back and get those. And we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019re going to be successful, but you have to go through as you can appreciate a long process and those appeals, again so we perceive and our tenants perceive as double counting if you will.","Bill Stein","","George, specifically the two states involved are California and Texas that are taxing both realty and personally. And in the third quarter, the incremental effect was 2.4 and in the fourth quarter the incremental effect was little over 3. So as Mike said, we\u2019re appealing those and hoping to win them. And that\u2019s net of reimbursements from our customers.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Stephen Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks for taking my question. I guess first, you mentioned that Yahoo sublease in Northern Virginia and I\u2019m wondering is there anything you are able to do kind of preempt that either by trying to further differentiate your product or -- in that market or prevent feeling that impact in the same way that Facebook is kind of impacted in Silicon Valley. And then I guess second, with recently announced Comcast Netflix deal, I\u2019m wondering if you have any thoughts on kind of net neutrality and how you think that different outcomes impact your business? Thanks.","Mike Foust","Sure. As to Yahoo, that product in our competitor is very different from our POD 3.0 architecture. So, it\u2019s very much of shared back claim for the power train or UPS and panels and electrical switchgear and also HVAC is not as modular as with our POD 3.0. So, our customers historically, and this is true in Ashburn as well, they really strongly desire the fully dedicated, UPS dedicated power and cooling. So that\u2019s a huge product differentiator for us. We don\u2019t believe that this sublease face will have much of an impact at all on our customers; And I think that\u2019s -- and the customers we\u2019re pursuing, and I think that\u2019s reflected in the current good funnel of prospected tenants that we have.","Comcast is growing tremendously, as we can -- even before their merger announcements. And we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of business that we\u2019ve been the beneficiary of from Comcast. They are very big customer for Digital Realty. And we see them and their subsidiaries growing and hopefully growing with us quite actively. The kind of issues around net neutrality are probably inevitable as we need more and more bandwidth, we see Netflix is entering into agreement recently with Comcast, and I just read yesterday where they\u2019re negotiating with other large carriers like AT&T and Verizon. So that appears to be an important trend in order to deliver low latency, very high quality customer consumer experience as we want more and more gaming, content, films, TV shows et cetera over broadband.","Matt Miszewski","Steve, this is Matt Miszewski. We\u2019ve been very involved with obviously both Comcast and Netflix as well as the number of other content distribution networks and other providers of content. So, the Comcast, Netflix business terms were interesting. I believe that the market from time-to-time confuses what\u2019s going on with Comcast, Netflix as a net neutrality conversation. And it\u2019s a little bit different if you look at the actual terms of the agreement. But the one thing that it does point out is that when content providers are looking for purring arrangements, they\u2019re looking to get out of a current set of situations that they are with the current proprietary internet exchanges that exist which highlight sort of the new Open IX initiatives starting up amongst the country in Northern America.","So, we don\u2019t think that the Comcast, Netflix business arrangement signals anything with regard to net neutrality that\u2019s concerning but it does signal a move towards the more open internet exchange.","Stephen Douglas - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore","Good afternoon or morning for you guys. But thank you for taking the question here. I just was trying to get a sense as to what your expectations for commencements were for this year, those that are embedded in guidance. And I do see a backlog of $61 million, based on stuff that you\u2019ve signed already; in your guidance you\u2019ve talked about expected of leasing of $20 to $30 million. I am just trying to understand if that implies expected to commencements of $81 million to $91 million or if there is other numbers that go into that? Thanks.","Mike Foust","In our conservative view, we\u2019re looking at incremental income from commencements in the low 60s millions, annualized obviously that would be much higher.","Bill Stein","Annualized is over 100 Jonathan, on a GAAP basis.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I can instead of asking a follow up actually, I have got different question. I\u2019d also be very interested in how your progress around [fibering] your buildings together is, whether you are seeing customer demand for that and how that\u2019s impacting the sales process? Thanks","Mike Foust","I\u2019ll let Matt jump in. It\u2019s been a tremendous boon. I mean it really has changed the landscape. Our buildings are already well connected by networks and now with the network ecosystem in place in all this major markets, we are able to provide a whole another level of connectivity and interconnection for our customers. And we are seeing in virtually every market customers utilizing that or we\u2019ve got the metro providers utilizing it to deliver lift services to our customers. In fact I just came from London last week and we\u2019ve already sold 23 pairs of dark fiber to customers and virtually every new customer in the London and connecting to Europe markets are taking dark fiber with us. So, it\u2019s been a tremendous addition.","Matt Miszewski","","Yes. And Jonathan, throughout -- we got an early start in the European market with regard to network ecosystem but also throughout 2013 in North America have primarily finished connecting up the campuses internally, connecting the campuses together. I can tell you from a sales perspective, it takes one of the concerns away from our customers in terms of easy network connectivity and then on the bottom line, it has a demonstrative impact on opportunities in the pipeline right now where customers are comparing two properties, one that is connected by digital ecosystem and one that\u2019s not which has a multi-million dollar effect under total cost ownership. So the ecosystem process in Northern America and definitely the ecosystem process in Europe have both been tailwinds to the leasing process.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","","Terrific, thanks. Starting with your demand drivers, you talked about mid-markets and content providers; could you also describe your progress penetrating entirely new Fortune 500 type verticals that are moving to the cloud, petrochemicals and so forth or any of them looking particularly attractive given your recent experience? And then as you beef up the sales force to accomplish this if it\u2019s going to take several years, should we expect gradual upward pressure on G&A going forward?","Bill Stein","Yes, so great question. Within the content world, obviously content continues to be king across all of our customers, not just the CDNs and the ISPs out there, but other providers of content and continues to be a heightened focus for us especially given the digital Open IX initiative, as well as the digital ecosystem initiatives. But within the Fortune 500, there is an uptick in activity in several verticals, energy being one of them. Inside our Q4 results we saw some impressive TKF numbers coming out of the energy vertical, incredible numbers coming out of the cloud vertical, which we talked about today on the call, continued performance out of financial services, but in the mid market in particular a new focus on smaller companies in the financial services industry who are interested in leveraging technology.","But due that I\u2019d like to sort of highlight for folks are little more complicated, but our pipeline is full with opportunities in as a mid-market space, as well as a large enterprise space in retail, where base data initiatives are really the light spot of retails\u2019 cash performance. And then healthcare internationally not in the personal identifiable health information space, but in the diagnostic space, which is something that we didn\u2019t necessarily anticipated, but we\u2019re happy to find both in the U.S., as well as in Continental Europe.","And if you look at G&A, we\u2019re projecting because of our scale and our efficiencies; we are looking at G&A as a percentage of revenues as a percentage of EBITDA to stay pretty steady over the next couple of years.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s perfect and then just one more demand type question, could you attempt to size for us the opportunity to capture more business from existing customers, any estimate on what portion of their total datacenter needs that currently outsourcing to you and then whether that\u2019s slowly on the rise?","Mike Foust","So, we do see a good uptick in repeat performance. If you look at the fourth quarter numbers in the details of who we lease to, we\u2019re very happy with what we call multisite customers. We anticipate that will increase, I don\u2019t have concrete data on the exact share of wallet that we have in each one of those accounts, but our focus during 2013 was expanding that share of wallet and actually targeting on the front side enterprises that had international growth ambitions and or even domestic growth ambitions outside of their headquarters activity. So, multisite for us is one of the competitive differentiators because we have a 130 plus properties and we\u2019re in 33 markets throughout the world. When we target customers that have multisite opportunities we do much better.","Bill Stein","It\u2019s very dramatic looking at folks in cloud, financial services, IT services are various which include cloud doing multiple market, multiple continents we\u2019ve been very, very active in 2013 and continue to be very, very active in 2014. It is a huge differentiator for us that we are really the only folks that can provide that consistent program, consistent quality of product services, contracting across so many different markets.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys. Just I wanted to go back some of the comments Mike on the pricing trends; I know you attributed a lot of the downward movement to mix. But just curious it sounds like supply is also sort of stable. But just wondering if there are any markets where you are seeing incremental pricing pressure either from a reduction in demand or increase in supply? And also I had a follow-up, if you could just maybe comment on specifically what you\u2019re seeing in Phoenix?","Mike Foust","So, I would say that we\u2019re pretty well stabilized across the domestic markets. And we\u2019re seeing very good pricing in Asia-Pac markets today. So I would say staying stabilized in the European market even at this point. I mean we\u2019re not seeing blips up and down, Asia-Pac continues to be extremely strong.","Matt Miszewski","Yes. Vincent this is Matt. I did, I pull the report daily to make sure we\u2019re on track and I look at our current fiscal year pipeline numbers in terms of pricing power and compared to the 2013 across the board and what I can characterize it is I was pleased at the result of the data that I called, now this is pipeline data so it\u2019s certainly as we get into the negotiation process I fully expect that the pricing I am currently seeing in the pipe will constraint it\u2019s up a little bit but even given that understanding I am very happy with where the pricing is today and given our past performance where we expect that to lend, we\u2019ll get in leases.","Mike Foust","Yes. And Phoenix is going pretty well. We had a lot of leasing early last year we had kind of a quite period the last of couple of quarters and now the pipeline of prospects that we\u2019re pursuing actively has grown pretty significantly.","Matt Miszewski","Yes. Vincent, we have a number of prospects that we\u2019re pursuing in [Chickie] and Chandler in Phoenix currently and I don\u2019t see any pricing trends that give me a great deal of concern in any of those deals that we\u2019re chasing in Q1, Q2 and Q3.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Dave Rodgers of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","Yes, good morning out there. I guess following up on the question about rates, I assume you\u2019re kind of talking about stabilized or lease up assets, but as you think about new development and thanks for the color on the breakdowns of yields by kind of geography. But can you talk about given the more limited pipeline and development going forward whether the yields maybe should move up as you become more selective or with the better real estate market overall are those real, you are going to comment a little bit expectation on kind of the next round of start as you see them?","Mike Foust","We are pretty pleased what we have been achieving. Certainly overall, if you look the leasing in the last quarter, so we are looking at stabilized returns between 11.5%, so we are on average and that\u2019s unlevered that\u2019s based on projections for the individual leases. So we look at this lease-by-lease look fully loaded.","Certainly as the mix expands in Asia-Pac that will increase. And I think as we see kind of the more stabilized situations and we are fully implemented in POD 3.0 which is a very efficient way to construct, while we have flexibility that adapt for different customer requirements. We are coming in at pretty good price on this brand new round of projects. So I think that combination will put some upward pressure on yields.","Bill Stein","Let me follow-up a little bit on that, not directly responsive, but the ROA on the company as a whole on a portfolio level will also be possibly impacted by the lease up of our existing finished inventory, which is fairly significant and as we lease up datacenter shells and we add additional thoughts. We no longer have the drag on the vacant shelf space, so both of those items will contribute to an increase in ROI on the entire portfolio.","Dave Rodgers - Robert W. Baird","That\u2019s helpful. And then the $80 million to $90 million I think you had put in original guidance for additional CapEx this year, telling that out to page 33 on the supplement the line enhancements and other non-recurring, does that suggest the $80 million to $90 million is down from the $111 million or $112 million that you kind of quoted in \u201813 or is that an additional $80 million to $90 million on top of that number?","Mike Foust","","Well it\u2019s somewhat of a reduction from what we invested in the properties in 2013, and these are wide range of improvements replacing windows, replacing roofs, elevators adding UPS, additional UPS and additional capacity to buildings, those kinds of upgrades so it\u2019s a wide range of activities at the properties that are non-recurring and either adding more space or replacing items like windows and roofs and elevators et cetera.","Bill Stein","","You could see in the supp and I think you referenced it Dave, for the year 2013 we are showing $111.5 million and our guidance is $85 million to $90 million, so it is down.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Jon Petersen of MLV & Company. Please go ahead.","Jon Petersen - MLV & Company","","Okay. Thank you. Just wanted to ask a quick question on the development pipeline, the new disclosure at the Investor Day is really helpful, but I am looking at the base building construction and trying to kind of understand how to model that going forward, I know that that includes some properties that are going to go on to be developed out of Turn-Key Flex and some of them are just going to leased out at power base buildings. Can you kind of give us an idea of the kind of the breakdown of what falls into which one of those buckets and any sort of timing on when we can expect, when you guys expect to receive revenue on those investments?","Mike Foust","","Generally speaking, the large majority of our business is Turn-Key, I mean that really is -- not exclusively, but I would say 80% to 90% of our leasing is fully fitted out Turn-Key data center space. And that\u2019s both the TKF in the custom. So the customs often has other ancillary facilities like office space and testing space along with it.","So I think it is safe to say that 80% to 90% of our base building development is going ultimately toward Turn-Key. If you look at the Turn-Key in custom that\u2019s under construction now that\u2019s data center construction, 79.4% as we say is leased currently over 550,000 feet. And so we\u2019ll continue as we continue to build out POD 3.0\u2019s pod by pod that will be built out in these base buildings and continue to add to that finish inventory.","Jon Petersen - MLV & Company","Okay. All right that\u2019s helpful, thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks. So the connectivity offer, I just wanted to see kind of where that stands, you\u2019ve fully built out across all three major regions and are you seeing different demand profile by region?","Bill Stein","So, we\u2019re fully built out in our, as of early February in all of our markets here in North America our major markets. We\u2019re fully built out in London, there we have some interesting new opportunities at variable cost to add to that. And that connectivity in London goes right into the continental networks.","So, essentially we have connectivity to our continental data centers today back to the major pairing points especially in Amsterdam, Paris and London. In Asia-Pac, it\u2019s a little bit different [technology] of networks. So, we\u2019re really focused on the international, inter market connectivity and for example between Singapore and Hong Kong, between the Sydney and the Melbourne bringing that connectivity between these markets.","Mike Foust","And Jonathan, the connectivity in particular in Asia-Pacific is coming as a result of customer requirements first and foremost. So again my comments about Sydney and in particular Melbourne as well as needs in Singapore and Hong Kong are really sort of developed directly from customer requirement. It had been the plan on digital ecosystem to make sure that Asia-Pac was covered to this fiscal year and we\u2019re blessed to be able to do that at the same time that we\u2019ve got customer request asking for that connectivity.","Bill Stein","And I will say that in Singapore with our flagship, the property there, we\u2019ve developed quite a bit of new metro fiber connectivity through different carriers in that market. So we have a very good network architecture now of metro carrier serving our Singapore facility.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","And then on the Turn-Key rent trends you talked about how geographic mix kind of influenced that more than the same markets rental trends. And looking forward would you expect to further influence of geographic mix or if the current mix that is reflected in 4Q kind of carried through the year, if that result for Turn-Key?","Bill Stein","I hold that match, but we will definitely have a different mix, because we have so many different major markets and it varies quarter-by-quarter as to the particular market mix in any particular quarter.","Mike Foust","Yes. So like I said as I take a look at current fiscal year forward looking pipeline I saw healthy pricing power in each of our markets but regionally there is pricing differential. So we need to keep that in mind but I didn\u2019t see a disturbing trend in any of the major markets we\u2019re involved with.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Yes. Good morning over there. First of all, thank you so much for all the new disclosure that\u2019s really, really good to see. And then question for you guys, the asset that was bought recently and contributed towards the JV, the acquisition price was in 8 cap. Could you talk a little bit about on what cap will you be contributing in towards the JV?","Mike Foust","Yes, so going in was a 9 with the debt restructuring because to make it more efficient for the JV, that cause turns it into an 8. And then\u2026","Bill Stein","We haven\u2019t closed on that contribution yet Tayo, we expect to do that by the end of the first quarter and I would rather not comment on the cap rate at which it is being contributed till after we closed.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And then second follow up question, the new hire for [AMB] just trying to understand a little bit better what his responsibilities are going to be and over the next one to two years whether it is some kind of the critical things you expect him to achieve for your bottom line?","Mike Foust","Just to be, it is not a hire. We have engaged Wayne, he has a firm here in San Francisco. And so we have engaged his firm. And he is going to, I think basically significantly upgrade our corporate information system. A few thing in portfolio reporting area right now basically the back half of itself that you see, a lot of that is excel based and our expectation is that data will be pooled from Yardi, which is the automated economic system that we use and use to populate the back half of that report.","And in addition some of that data will be summarized on a very frequent basis to provide real time management to exports for the executive team and the board.","Operator","Our next question will come from a follow up from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you. A couple of things, first on investment as we think about capitalized interest declining overtime and overall investment declining overtime, it didn\u2019t really happened in the fourth quarter. So I am curious what timing would look like, I guess what I am showing is, it seems to me that the total CAP or committed active development increased from about 900 million at the Investor Day to about 971 million today. I am curious at what point we should expect that to tail off and how low we should expect that to get or when the low point of the year should?","Mike Foust","","Well it starts the first quarter of this year. And at least over the course of this year the lowest amount of capitalized interest would be in the fourth quarter.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Is it just tail off consistently throughout the year?","Mike Foust","","Steps down each quarter, correct.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then Bill you talked about the financing timing. I am not sure if I am reading you right here, but in the guidance originally it said, not originally but now it says early 2014 for these financings to take place, but it sounded like you were looking more at a potential mid-year timing in terms of at least the swaps that you have -- the hedge that you have entered into?","Bill Stein","","Well that\u2019s correct, at least in the case of the U.S. dollar -- we have U.S. dollar bond deal in our planning and we have the swap lock expires basically July \u201815 so we would do something in the mid June to mid July timeframe to make sure that hedges appropriately effective. We would do either a sterling or preferred I suspect sometime from mid March until or blacked out in early April so that would the window for that financing assuming the markets are open and conducive. And then the final financing it could be then, it could midyear or just could be towards the end of the third quarter and that\u2019s going to be really a function of markets.","Operator","The final question will be a follow-up from Emmanual Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes, Michael Bilerman, I had two follow-ups; one was just Bill to sort of a little bit on the timing on these capital raises, because it sounds like it\u2019s later than early \u201814, from what you just said, but you given the fact that you said it\u2019s the biggest component, the biggest variable in guidance, can you at least be very specific about sources and uses, right? So if you think about what you\u2019ve put down in guidance call it 800 million to 1.2 billion of proceeds, about $450 million of debt rolling this year, I assume the balance, 350 to 700 is used to pay down the line at 1.6%. Obviously given the math, raising capital 5.5 to 6 and paying down the line is dilutive. But given when you do it, it\u2019s more dilutive to \u201815 than it is to the \u201814, as you delay it. So I just want to make sure that we completely understand what\u2019s embedded in guidance from a dilution standpoint of capital rates.","And then the second question is, the disclosure in the supplemental on the NAV components, which is extraordinarily helpful, I\u2019m just curious, if you look at that relative to what was presented at Investor Day, there seems to be much more NOI, which given that the trends that you are talking about make sense, but a number of other asset categories changed and it would appears though if you were to put the same cap rates on the NOI that you put at Investor Day that NAV could be upwards of $5 higher than what you presented. So if you presented 54 to 63, you could be talking something like 59 to 69. I don\u2019t know if there is other things going on in here that make it not comparable, but I wanted you to be able to go through that as well.","Bill Stein","Sure, okay. With respect to the financing, we\u2019re assuming and again this is all subject to change based on markets. But we are assuming a preferred and a Sterling offering in the first quarter essentially. And then the U.S. dollar deal as I said would be midyear since where we\u2019ve hedged it. In terms of -- and I think you\u2019re looking for amounts to, so for preferred we are assuming upwards of $300 million of Sterling debt, $480 million and U.S. dollar bond deal $250 million. So, that\u2019s our best estimate today. But again, that could change. And then you\u2019ve asked for NAV\u2026.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Just on the financing. So I mean based on the disclosure, I recognize how much you are rising; you\u2019ve laid it out in the guidance and the rates that you\u2019re targeting. What I\u2019m trying to understand is what you\u2019ve embedded in for the uses of that capital and the dilution associated with it that\u2019s embedded in guidance, because you spent a lot of time talking it, the most important variable in terms of timing. And so what I want to understand is what\u2019s actually in your guidance.","So you have $450 million of debt coming due at 5.6% this year. The only other use of proceeds could be the line of credit and if you just take your billing dollars of financing that will lease about $550 million to pay down the line. That result in a lower payback rate than what your raising the capital. So, I\u2019m just trying to figure out based on that guidance you gave, how much dilution have you embedded in for capital raising?","Bill Stein","Right now all of the new capital is going to pay down the revolver. That is obviously are very modest rate, (inaudible) so that\u2019s where the dilution is. And then revolver has been taken up over the course of the year as we complete our construction program which is what\u2019s in the -- was about in the guidance.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Okay. And then on NAV how does it compare Investor Day to today, it does look like there is additional other assets and obviously the NOI is very higher, so if we were to take the same cap rates is that the right math to do?","Bill Stein","Right. So there is about $26 million of increase in annualized NOI growth from Q3 to Q4. There is $14 million increase in NOI in the fiscal year \u201814 backlog. There is $500 million plus of CIP related asset value. And that\u2019s really the upside potential slide that we\u2019ve presented and then there is a $300 million increase in debt which would obviously from the NAV.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Following management's remarks, we will open the call to your questions which will be limited to one per caller. If you have additional questions, please feel free to return to the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Foust","Thank you, Pamela. Welcome to the call everyone. I will begin today's call with an overview of our operations as well as an update on our activity in our major markets. After my remarks, Bill will discuss our 2012 guidance, third quarter financial results and recent capital markets activities. Following his remarks, we will open the call to your questions.","While slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad, has delayed the decision-making process of many enterprise customers, based on our strong sales funnel and the investment opportunities we see in the market, we are very optimistic about the growth prospects and the near and long-term outlook for our business.","In fact, we are on the offensive, taking advantage of our strong balance sheet and financial resources to continue to both expand our portfolio through new development leasing and to be the consolidator in the industry consistently making accretive investments of strategic data center portfolios and individual properties.","Our deep team of professionals continues to execute this broad growth strategy that is unique in the data center sector.","Turning first to our leasing activity, during the quarter we commenced leases totaling approximately $26.9 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, including approximately $800,000 of colocation revenue. Year-to-date, as of September 30, 2012, lease commencements totaled $82.6 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue.","As stated in our earnings release this morning, we lowered the high-end of our leasing guidance range to between $130 million and $150 million for the year. The revised range includes our backlog of leases scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012, totaling approximately $29.2 million of annualized rental revenue. In addition, our 2013 backlog of leases scheduled to commence currently totals nearly $35 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue.","Consistent with what we discussed in our last call, the decrease from the high end of guidance is primarily due to the prolonged sales cycle which has made the timing of signings and therefore the timing of commencement difficult to predict. However, we continue to experience sustained growth in leasing activity.","For example, the revised range of $130 million to $150 million represents a 31% to 51% increase in annualized GAAP rental revenue over last year's commencement of $99 million. And 2011 was 30% higher over 2010 commencements. This is a continuation of the strong trend in growing year-over-year commencements. We believe this projected increase remains impressive by any measure and reflects growing demand for our products, despite the macroeconomic environment.","This compares very closely what we experienced in 2008 when demand for our data center space continued to increase, despite the state of the economy at large. This positive trend is confirmed by research report published by IDC last month which identified the impact of economic uncertainties over the last several years in the US data center market.","The report stated \"organizations began to eliminate smaller less efficient server rooms and server closets, while owners of larger data centers revaluated the sale and scope of IT systems housing their data center.\" The report went on to say \"the reduction of more limited data centers and the rapid expansion of larger data centers primarily build by a service provider will accelerate in the coming years driven by three major forces\".","One, efforts to extend the use of virtualization to the next phase with denser, more finely tuned converted systems. In other words, this means that organizations are migrating toward automated preconfigured IT systems that the older enterprise-owned data centers can't support.","Second, growing investments in data center assets to deal with the content explosion that is reshaping many industries from media to healthcare to energy. And thirdly, a shift to cloud architectures in the private area and business models in the public area that encourage greater use of third party data center facilities and assets.","We also believe that these macro trends in our industry along with the steady progress we've made in our leasing during the year and our current prospect funnel [belies] a negative sentiment surrounding our sector. In fact, we are currently tracking approximately 2 million square feet of demand. This demand represents prospect in our sales funnel to whom we have made proposals that we believe have a 30% or greater likelihood of signing.","In terms of new lease signings, we signed a strong volume leases for over 228,000 square feet of data center space including colo. And this totaled 16.4 megawatts of IT capacity. This IT capacity exceeds last quarter's volume of 12.3 million megawatts, as well as our prior four quarter average of 12.5 megawatts. Excluding colo, the weighted average lease term was 116 months.","The US was by far our strongest region accounting for approximately 211,000 square feet of data center leases signed in the quarter. This includes 87,000 square feet of Custom Solutions, which we firmly refer to as built-to-suit. Custom Solutions in Houston at an average to annual GAAP rental rate of $65 a foot.","Now, it's important to note that the lease rates for Custom Solutions space vary project-by-project, depending upon the engineering specifications and the type of improvements required by the customer and should not be made in a direct comparison to our TK Flex, Turn-Key Flex product.","For our Turn-Key Flex space, we leased 124,000 square feet in United States at an average annual GAAP rental rate of $142 per square foot. The rental rate is largely in line with our prior fourth quarter US average of $145 a foot. The slight decrease is largely due to leases signed in markets with lower development cost such as Houston, as well as in leases in Northern Virginia which might be the most competitive market in the country. We also completed leases in Phoenix and Silicon Valley where we signed a new lease for the newly completed Turn-Key POD at our 1100 Space Park property in Santa Clara.","Turning to Europe, we signed two small Turn-Key Flex leases in London, totaling 10,000 square feet, one in our Redhill facility and the other at the newly commission facility in Chessington. The average annual GAAP rental rate during the quarter was $198 per square foot for that small amount. No leases were signed or commenced during the quarter in the Asia Pacific regions, however, we do have a significant amount of active requirements there with leases signed already in October.","As we've said, lease rates and activity can vary widely market-by-market and region-by-region. That is why we focused on cash return on investment targets of between 11% and 14% for our spec development. Even without Singapore, we've historically contributed to a high end of the range. The quarterly cash return on investment for TK up leases signed in third quarter was a strong 13%.","ROI for our Turn-Key leases has been trending up in 2012. For example, second quarter ROI was up 60 basis points over first quarter and third quarter ROI was up 80 basis points over the second quarter average. The expansion of our colocation offering is on track, as we continue to build our leasing and deployment team to address opportunities. Leases signed for colo space during the quarter totaled $1.3 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $3.4 million.","In prior quarters, leasing activity from our colo offering was primarily driven by a 365 Main Street facility in San Francisco. However, we saw an increase during the quarter in signings in certain of our Internet gateway data centers and other select DLR facilities as we gained momentum in those additional markets.","Turning now to our lease renewal activity, in response to concerns around renewal rates we're including both cash and GAAP numbers in today's call. We signed approximately 26,000 square feet of Turn-Key and Powered Base Building space at renewal rates that were up 15.7% on a GAAP basis and up 7.6% on a cash basis. This includes approximately 14,000 square feet of Turn-Key space and an average GAAP rental rate per square foot of $127, which is up 16% on the GAAP basis and 7.8% on a cash basis.","On a square foot basis, 62% of expiring Turn-Key space was renewed in the second quarter, with an average lease term of 45 months on the renewals. With so little rolling during the quarter, the lower than average renewal rate was primarily due to one customer that reduced its space in one property in favor of consolidating into new and expanded space in another deal at our facility. So we deliver a lot of flexibility to our tenants with multiple property solutions that often end up being very accretive for our shareholders.","Portfolio occupancy increased in the quarter to 94.2% compared to 93.5% in the second quarter. The increase was driven by, one, the addition of over 75,000 square feet of space that was leased from our existing operating portfolio. Secondly, the 99% leased Sentrum Portfolio and that's 99% net of redevelopment space.","Three, a second 94% leased property entering the portfolio on acquisition. And fourthly, lease space that was converted from our redevelopment inventory. These additions were partially offset by the lease termination noted above and vacant space converted from our redevelopment inventory into our operating portfolio.","The same-store occupancy also increased to 93.4% from 92.9% in the second quarter. Third quarter same-store NOI was relatively unchanged at $181.4 million compared to $181.6 million in the previous quarter. Excluding the non-data center Solyndra Building in Fremont, third quarter same-store NOI for the data center portfolio was $181.8 million, up 0.7% from $180.5 million in the previous quarter.","Same-store cash NOI, which we define as same-store NOI adjusted for straight line rents and adjusted for non-cash purchase accounting adjustments was $161.8 million in the third quarter and that is an increase from $161.1 million in the second quarter. Again, excluding Solyndra Building, third quarter same-store cash NOI for the data center portfolio was $162.2 million, up 1.3% from $160 million in the previous quarter.","I would now like to renew some of the supply\/demand trends we're tracking in our US major markets. We define supply as our best estimate of data center space that is either built out or under construction. Moving east to west, in the New York, New Jersey Metro, we're currently tracking approximately 34 megawatts of potential demand. This compares to 24 megawatts of available supply, a healthy situation.","We currently have 1.6 megawatts of built out supply in New Jersey with three 1125 kW PODs under construction, as well as we have a capacity to accommodate virtually any requirement with our existing redevelopment inventory. In Northern Virginia, we're tracking nearly, 30 megawatts of potential demand. This compares to approximately 27 megawatts of available supply. We currently have 1 megawatt of supply built with three 1125 purpose built data centers PODs to be delivered in the second quarter of 2013, and a new building that's currently under construction at our Digital Ashburn Campus.","Dallas remains a very active market for us with limited available built out supply. We've identified approximately 26 megawatts of demand compared to about 9 megawatts of supply. Our current built out supply totals 1.5 megawatts. The construction of two new buildings continued on our Richardson campus during the quarter with the first two 1125 kW Turn-Key Flex data centers to be delivered in January of 2013. So, once again, we have very little exposure and we're working hard to bring on new supply to meet this demand that we're seeing in Dallas as well as other markets including Virginia and New Jersey.","Silicon Valley demand has increased for the third quarter in a row with nearly 37 megawatts identified. This compares to nearly 29 megawatts of supply. We currently have about 5.1 megawatts currently under construction.","Turning now to our acquisition program which remains essential to our business model and a key component of our growth strategy. We will close approximately $1.4 billion of new acquisitions of 2012. As we discussed in our last call, the completion of the Sentrum Portfolio demonstrates our ability to source, fund and complete accretive transactions that add stable long-term income.","In addition, it delivers the opportunity to expand our global customer base and further enhance our operating scale and the debt of our technical and operations talent. In addition, we continue to identify attractive single property acquisitions such as the 286,000 square foot data center and office complex we closed recently in Aurora, Colorado. The property consists of three interconnected buildings and includes approximately 170,000 square feet of data center space.","It is currently 94% leased to two customers with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. It's located near our Englewood 8534 Concord Center Drive facility in the suburban area and expands our presence in the Denver market, contributing to our revenue stream of long-term stabilized leases. We remain committed to maintaining our dominant position as the market consolidator and we're currently tracking property acquisitions totaling more than $600 million globally.","Finally, I'll briefly review our growing development program. We continue to ramp up construction to build out supply in select markets to meet current demand. We have increased our construction team from 40 to over 50 professionals since last year. Current development activity includes 468,000 square feet of Turn-Key space that is 31% preleased, 190,000 square feet of custom solution space that is 100% preleased and approximately 1 million square feet of Powered Base Building, PBB space for future inventory in key markets.","Detailed information on our development activity by market can be found on pages 20 and 29 of the third quarter supplemental package. We are investing more this year in new construction than we have in our history. We expect development spending to continue at this pace or higher going forward.","We believe that our disciplined investment management approach and superior balance sheet allows us to better manage market risk by diversifying our capital deployment across geographies and product types. Our strategy is both unique in the marketplace and a critical component to our continued success. We attribute this success with a team of dedicated real estate and technical professionals which continue to drive the growth of our business.","Year-over-year, our team has [maintained] committed to excellence and innovation delivering superior data center solutions to our customers while achieving attractive returns from our investment program. This in turn continues to drive solid earnings growth for our shareholders. As I said in my opening remarks, we were very optimistic about our growth prospects and the long-term outlook for our business.","I will now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Stein","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my remarks today with a detailed discussion of our updated 2012 guidance, followed by a review of our financial performance and capital markets activities. Please note that all per share results are on a diluted share and unit basis. As stated in today's earnings release with better visibility towards our year-end results, we are narrowing our 2012 FFO guidance range to between $4.40 and $4.44 per share, increasing the low end by $0.03 and reducing the high end by $0.04.","Furthermore, we now expect FFO and core FFO, which includes items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams to be identical for the year. As a result, this guidance represents expected FFO growth of 8.4% to 9.4% over 2011 FFO of $4.06 per share. Reflected in the revised FFO per share range are the following assumptions, which have been updated since our last call.","We narrowed our range of revenue recognized from Digital Design Services to between $8 million and $9 million. The high end of our development and redevelopment capital expenditures was reduced by $100 million to between $700 million and $800 million. Our previous guidance also assumed losses from early extinguishment of debt of $30 million to $31 million related to the Sentrum acquisition.","After further research, it was determined that the appropriate accounting treatment was to record such costs as part of the acquisition since Digital never intended, nor was required by the contract to assume the debt and the related swaps. The purchase price was adjusted to reflect the debt extinguishment and this treatment does not impact FFO.","Finally, as Mike mentioned in his remarks, we reduced the high end of our leasing assumptions range by $20 million to between $130 million to $150 million of annualized GAAP rental revenue contributed from the commencement of leases. The updated range includes the year-to-date commencements of $83 million, $29 million of backlog from signed leases that we expect to commence in the fourth quarter, and what we expect to sign and commence between now and the end of the year based on our current sales funnel, which per this guidance will range between $18 million and $38 million in the fourth quarter. Consistent with last year and given the $20 million range in fourth quarter leasing guidance, we plan to provide 2013 guidance in January.","Let me now turn to the quarter's financial results. As stated in today's earnings release, third quarter 2012 FFO was $1.13 per share, up 11.9% from the third quarter of 2011 FFO of $1.01 per share and up 3.7% from the second quarter 2012 FFO or $1.09 per share. Adjusting for items that do not represent ongoing expenses or revenue streams, third quarter 2012 core FFO was the same as reported FFO at $1.13 per share.","Adjustments to FFO in the third quarter included non-core revenues of approximately $1.1 million consisting of fees associated with the early termination of two leases. These non-core revenues were offset by certain items that do not reflect ongoing expenses consisting of $500,000 in transaction expenses, the majority of which was related to the Sentrum acquisition and $923,000 in non-core expense adjustments relating to intangibles associated with the lease terminations mentioned previously.","The Sentrum purchase agreement contains a contingent consideration clause or earn-out. This obligation expires in July 2015. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, an acquirer is required to recognize the fair value of such contingent consideration as additional purchase price. At the acquisition date, we accrued an $88 million liability related to the pending consideration. Any future changes to the fair value of this contingent consideration will be reflected in earnings.","We've also recorded a $106 million deferred tax liability for the Sentrum portfolio as of the acquisition date to reflect temporary differences between book and tax basis for items contained on the balance sheet to account for the tax effects of this business combination. The deferred tax liabilities will be amortized over the lives of the underlying assets. These liabilities are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued liabilities.","Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the third quarter of 2012 was $115.6 million up from $101.2 million in the previous quarter. The diluted AFFO payout ratio for the third quarter of 2012 was 82.5% down from 85.4% in the last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA at quarter end of $200.5 million grew by 30% from $154.3 million in the third quarter of 2011 and by 10% from $182.2 million last quarter.","As you review the balance sheet, you will see that accrued \u2013 that account receivables increased by approximately $55.4 million from December 31, 2011 to $146 million at September 30, 2012, primarily due to the Sentrum acquisition which accounts for about $40.1 million in the increase as a result of quarterly rents that were built in September and are due in October. The remainder relates primarily to tenants in newly acquired properties and developed space coming online.","Accounts payable increased approximately $300.9 million from December 31, 2011 to $616 million at September 30, 2012, due primarily to the deferred tax liability in the contingent consideration recorded in conjunction with the Sentrum acquisition that I mentioned earlier. The remaining increase primarily relates to construction and other property specific accruals across the portfolio.","Turning now to the income statement, net operating income increased by [$22 million] to $211.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $189.7 million last quarter. Overall, this increase was primarily due to incremental revenue from new leasing and acquisitions.","Looking down the income statement, tenant reimbursements increased to $78.9 million in the third quarter from $60.4 million in the previous quarter. This $18.5 million increase is largely driven by seasonal fluctuations in utility costs and subsequent reimbursements which are higher in the summer months and an additional $3 million of non-utility reimbursements associated with the Sentrum acquisition. The decreases in other revenues reflects termination fees relating to the Solyndra lease which was recognized in the second quarter.","On the expense side, rental property operating and maintenance expenses increased to $106.7 million from $87.6 million in the previous quarter. The $19.1 million increase is largely driven by a $15 million increase in utility expense during the period of which approximately $6 million relates to the Sentrum acquisition and the remaining relates to the seasonal summer increases in usage and rates. These utility expense increases are offset by higher reimbursements. The balance of the $4.1 million relates to cost other than utilities of which $1.7 million relates to the acquisition of the Sentrum Portfolio.","NOI margins decreased third quarter versus second quarter by approximately 170 basis points due to the loss of NOI at the Solyndra property this quarter resulting from its bankruptcy and the seasonal increase in utility reimbursements and expenses which inflates total revenue.","The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was due to a $2.3 million gain associated with the disposition of a non-core property in the second quarter. Tax expense decreased to $710,000 from $1.2 million in the second quarter primarily due to a true-up of non-cash deferred taxes.","Lastly, preferred stock dividends decreased to $9.8 million from $10.3 million due to the conversion of 1.87 million shares of series D convertible preferred stock into common stock during the third quarter.","Finally, I'd like to review our recent capital markets activities, liquidity and important credit metrics. Over the last few months, we've executed interest rate swaps converting approximately 75% of the term loan balance from floating to fixed rate. As of today, the all-in weighted average interest rate on the term loan is 2.325%. This is consistent with our strategy of minimizing our financial risk while seeking to achieve the lowest possible cost of capital given market conditions.","Year-to-date, we've raised approximately $2.4 billion of new capital which includes the $300 million US dollar unsecured notes offering as well as a $300 million commitment increase on the global revolving credit facility completed during the third quarter. On September 24, we completed the issuance of $300 million of 10-year unsecured notes at Digital's lowest coupon rate to-date of 3.625% and a yield of 3.784%.","The coupon is 162.5 basis points lower than the 10-year coupon on our March 2011 unsecured notes issuance and 87.5 basis points lower than the five-year coupon on our July 2010 unsecured notes issuance. This debt issuance further reduces our embedded cost of capital and improves spreads on investments.","We've also positioned ourselves for additional financial flexibility in future periods. Certain covenants were modified to align the most recent indenture with the covenants included in our global revolving credit facility and multicurrency term loan. Modifications included a cap rate reduction from 9% to 8.25% as well as an increase in the cross payment for our cross acceleration threshold from $50 million to $75 million. We also added language that excludes unconsolidated joint ventures from the calculation of total unencumbered assets. Under the terms of this indenture at September 30, 2012 incremental debt capacity would be increased by $450 million.","We have almost $1.3 billion of immediate liquidity, which includes approximately $79 million in short-term investments and funds that can be drawn on our global revolving credit facility. If this liquidity were fully utilized, we would remain in compliance with all covenants contained in the global revolving credit and term loan facilities, our Prudential shelf facility and other unsecured debt.","During the quarter, we repaid a consolidated secured loan totaling $52.8 million. In 2013, we have $226.8 million of ongoing principal amortization and debt maturities with the weighted average cost of 6%, which we plan to retire initially with proceeds from the revolver that we'll eventually replace with additional long-term unsecured debt and\/or preferred stock.","Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times at quarter end, up from 4.6 times at the end of the second quarter. Our GAAP fixed charge ratio was 3.7 times compared to the previous quarter at 3.4 times, and our weighted average cost of debt including interest rate swaps was 4.35% at quarter-end, down from 4.67% as of last quarter end.","As a reminder, we manage leverage based on two key metrics. Fixed charge coverage and debt-to-EBITDA. Our plan is to maintain fixed charge coverage ratios in excess of the high 2s and debt-to-EBITDA in a range of 5 to 5.5 times.","As always, we welcome your comments and greatly appreciate your continued support.","Pamela Garibaldi","Operator, we'd like to open the call to questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. So I guess the big question here is how can we get comfortable with the remaining commencement guidance in the fourth quarter? I know you've laid out kind of your pipeline of $29 million backlog. Can you talk about the rest of it and kind of where you stand on these leases and why we should be comfortable that you're going to hit that number?","Michael Foust","Sure. We've got \u2013 as I've mentioned, the funnel is very full with prospects and in prospects that \u2013 to whom we've made proposals, that was that 2 million square feet of proposals. And if we look at our prospects that we're negotiating leases with currently, that makes us very comfortable that we're going to achieve well within that range. So from the amount of activity we're seeing, which is in excess of what we achieved in the third quarter, we're very comfortable with the amount of transactions that we're actively working to sign up and commence.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I guess a little more color. I mean can you characterize where they are in the process, I guess is we're just thinking about what's to come certainly the fiscal cliff is on people's minds, business decision-making seems to be slowing down. Why would those \u2013 why wouldn't these wait until next year?","Michael Foust","I think what folks have, maybe in this environment, having trouble understanding is that these are requirements that have to be in place now. They have to be in place for customer requirements, in a lot of cases it's cloud providers and IT service providers who have customer contracts that they need to get up and running. So they need to get this space going. It's enterprise \u2013 some enterprise customers who have requirements, expansions, new applications that are going to save money and raise productivity that they need to get up and running early in 2013.","I can't give you the actual names of the customers, but many of these are repeat customers of ours that we have relationships with and we're actively negotiating leases. So we're very comfortable that \u2013 we're working on real deals with major international companies, looking at major cloud providers and managed service providers, international financial companies, system integrators who are providing space for international financial firms, international tech and Internet-based businesses. So it's a very wide range of customers that we're engaged with currently.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a final follow-up on the same topic. When you think about the second quarter earnings release and the guidance you gave then and now you're at the lower end. What's kind of changed in that number to get you to the lower end?","Michael Foust","Well, I'd say -- we brought down the top end but we didn't lower the lower end. But we're very confident that we're going to be well within the range with a substantial backlog of signed leases going into 2013 in addition. So based on the activity, our folks are, on the leasing side are, I think I can safely say, as busy as they've ever been.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And I guess that these leases that got pushed out or if some have fallen out of bed, I assume you saw it when you gave the second quarter number that that was -- the midpoint was the reasonable point you'd hit?","Michael Foust","Yeah, it's timing. It's timing. I'm looking at one particular lease as an example and the tenant and us, all thought it was going to be signed in the second quarter and it's going to signed next month. So it's really not a matter of requirements not there, it's \u2013 in some cases, it's a matter of timing.","Bill Stein","Jamie, there's one deal that I know that was done away. It's a pretty good size.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I guess (inaudible) when you think about \u2013 I'm sorry.","Michael Foust","I'm just saying in the Southwest where, because of the timing, our building wasn't going to be done in time and we thought that their timing was going to be a little more flexible. But we didn't have the capacity built yet.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. So does this suggest your 2013 \u2013 I mean some of the stuff getting pushed back that you actually feel better about lease signing next year than you did three or four months ago?","Michael Foust","We've always been competent. I think perhaps market observers haven't appreciated and we haven't done as good a job and maybe perhaps we could at that, demand for data center space of all sorts continues to expand at a pretty good cliff and that's what IDC is seeing, that's what other firms like Forrester and Gartner are seeing. So we're comfortable and we've been very positive about the near-term and long-term growth of the business.","Jamie Feldman -- Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Caton with Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line may be on mute.","Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on Jamie's line of questioning. You gave demand in the market across, I think, four markets; New York, Virginia, et cetera. It added up, I think, to 127 megawatts. I think compared to the second quarter that was 143. So I was hoping you could comment on the ins and outs of that funnel in terms of leases that are getting signed and new demand that's kind of coming into the funnel, how are those trending?","And then the uses, how are they thinking about pricing as they kind of hang out in terms of trying to make a decision, where was their thinking on pricing three, six, nine months ago and where do they think they'll ultimately sign?","Michael Foust","Sure. On the demand side, from our appalling of the market, a couple of things. There was some absorption, so customers got signed leases. Also, we changed our methodology a little bit. We were including federal government requirements all in Northern Virginia because that's what we are marketing to the different departments. And so we've spread that out now to the actual locations now that we have some better visibilities where they want to be. And then thirdly, there were a few customers that \u2013 respective customers that didn't move ahead mostly in kind of private equity-backed colo companies. But largely I think was absorption and how we're looking at our federal government program.","Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley","Thanks. And then just on the pricing, how has their expectation on rate changed over kind of year-to-date in terms of \u2013 in some of these markets?","Michael Foust","I think customers typically are looking at \u2013 because leases are long, they're looking at kind of average rents over time periods. I would say generally that as I've been saying for the past several quarters, Northern Virginia is probably the most competitive and the market where we've seen the most decline in rents. So it really hasn't had much effect on our returns as we continue to get more effective.","Other markets, we're seeing the lease rates pretty stable year-over-year. I think we've expressed that out of our 32 markets, some softness in Silicon Valley, some softness in Virginia and some softness in New Jersey. But we're still attaining good returns and other markets are pretty stable at very high returns process as we noted earlier.","Chris Caton -- Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Yeah, it's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. Just want to go back to the pipeline a little bit. If we dial ourselves back a year to this call, the forward backlog for 2012 at that point was $37 million, this year is $35 million, even though the portfolio has grown substantially in size. So I sort of want to understand that a little bit in context of this order of ramp?","And then when we think about what's still needed to not only sign but actually commence in 2012, the revised guidance you'd put out, you're talking $20 million to $40 million of annualized rents, it's still a big number and obviously it's nice to have backlog of $29 million that you already know, but that's still a very large number relative to your history.","And so what's unclear to us is there are a couple of big leases in there that \u2013 you got one $5 million, you got another one of $2 million. That gives us more confidence that we're going to get to those numbers. And then just as a third part of that, we ended the second quarter, you talked about having a $41 million backlog for this year. You commenced 26 in the third quarter and now you have a backlog of 29. Maybe you can just help us understand how that backlog \u2013 how much came into the third quarter and how much went into the fourth quarter?","Michael Foust","I mean generally, the leasing activity has been consistently growing in terms of requirements and we're seeing a lot of fourth quarter business that we've been engaged with for quite a while. And folks are working hard on both the customer side and our side to get leases on \u2013 get leases completed in the fourth quarter. Like I said, our sales teams are busier than they've ever been and we've got a number of large \u2013 relatively large leases spread widely across the portfolio that make us confident that we can \u2013 in addition to the backlog that's signed in and placed that the funnel will allow us to make good that range of commencement.","And I think also folks get a little too wrapped up about, does something commence in November or does it commence in February? We're talking long-term leases here that have long-term contribution to earnings. So while we're confident of making our range, I think people get a little hung up on 60 to 90 days swings in activity.","Bill Stein","And Mike, the total backlog for this year and subsequent years is over $78 million. So it's 29 in Q4, but\u2026","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Right. But this time last year you gave a figure of $37 million for 2012 which would be comparable for the $35 million for 2013. So for something that should be accelerating, I would have assumed at this point next year the pipeline would be even greater than it would, not a little bit less. Now I don't know if that's because you have so much more coming in the fourth quarter relative to where you were last year, but I was just trying to bring it up as a point of reference.","And to Mike's comment about \u2013 yes, well, I think we all understand that long-term leasing is important, but you also have to understand it from the Street's perspective, you started at 145 to 180, 145 to 180 became 130 to 170, 130 to 170 became 130 to 150. We can all understand that things take longer to occur, but at some point there is some element of \u2013 are things falling out of bed or are they just being pushed. And if they're being pushed, then there is an immediate hit to the growth rate?","Michael Foust","Yeah, Michael. We've got \u2013 the $35 million of backlog will very likely be much higher by the time we get to the end of the year for 2013. So we're talking about the backlog as it exists today in October. By the time we hit December, that backlog going into 2013 will certainly be larger.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Hopefully, it doesn't come from the $20 million to $40 million that you still have to sign and commence this year moving into next year. The last question is on the 2 million\u2026","Michael Foust","Once again, Michael, I think you're really missing the point. This is \u2013 I mean we're talking about near-term leasing and the amount of activity is there. And we're executing on it. And it's fully 30% to 50% higher than the last year.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Right.","Michael Foust","I think folks are losing sight that growth is there and it continues to be demonstrated.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","The 2 million square feet funnel that you talk about, obviously the dollars associated with that would be completed different if it was Turn-Key or Powered Base Building. What is the annualized rent related to that 2 million square feet?","Michael Foust","I don't have that number. I don't have it calculated. But it's a much higher majority now of Turn-Key spaces versus Powered Base Building. The mix is clearly shifted for folks wanting the fully fitted out solution.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Right. So like a $200 million potential number?","Michael Foust","I haven't added it up, but it would be substantial, yes.","Michael Bilerman -- Citigroup","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Foust","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jon Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets","Yes. I'm interested a little bit in the colo business and maybe give us an update on how you see that growing over time as well as your propensity to sign tenant deals with colo and hosting companies? And is that a type of tenant group that you would emphasize differently going forward in favor of other verticals? And then during the prepared remarks, you talked about I think October leasing and Asia-Pac and can you maybe talk about recent trends in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong in that context?","Michael Foust","Sure. In terms of the colo business, we're focused on our existing buildings, especially in Internet gateway buildings and other buildings where we have the high concentration of networks that is very attracted to the colo. And where we have inside staff that we can leverage to bring cost effectively, bring that smaller footprint higher touch business online across several buildings in the portfolio. So that is going at pace. We're making sure we're doing it in a very methodical way, so we have a high-level customer service that folks expect. And what's interesting is if you look at a lot of the customers for colo, they are cloud providers, managed hosting providers, content distribution. We're seeing folks that are doing gaming, online gaming with handhelds. I mean there is a lot of really interesting applications that don't take a lot of space. And that's a good set of customers for our colo business.","The other question about Asia-Pac, yeah, we've had a little bit of a wall in terms of signings, but not reflective of any decrease in the amount of business we're pursuing. And we're seeing a lot of increased requirements from folks that are providing cloud services, managed services in the region. And we're seeing those requirements being signed in Sydney and Singapore and it's still early days in Hong Kong where we're ways off, but we have interest in Hong Kong preliminary interest from both, those sort of folks as well as especially from corporate enterprise and international Internet companies looking for additional space in both Hong Kong as well as in Singapore. So we're very positive about the activity in Asia-Pac in general.","Jon Atkin -- RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank","Hi, everyone. Just maybe a follow-up on the Asia-Pac discussion and in the context of keeping the development pipeline going, just wondering if you could update us on Japan and the progress that's been made there?","Michael Foust","Yes. I mean we're \u2013 our team's looking very hard at the Japan market, certainly Tokyo as well as Osaka. And while we don't have anything to announce as yet, we're looking very hard at opportunities because we do see a significant amount of demand, especially from international firms with whom we have relationships who need expansion space or they need a business continuance in areas outside of Tokyo region. So it's something \u2013 it's a market region in Japan that we're looking at very actively.","Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank","Okay. And is that sort of the next step in Asia?","Michael Foust","I would guess yes with the focus that we're giving it, and certainly conversations on possible ventures in China as well. But Japan is really on the front burner at the moment in terms of new markets.","Vincent Chao -- Deutsche Bank","Right, that's what I meant. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","Hi. I'm here with Gab Hilmoe. A question on your rent spreads. Can you give us a sense of how your in-place cash rents across the portfolio compare to the rents that you're achieving on new renewal leases or maybe in other words, what's the current cash mark-to-market on your portfolio? I think there's a real question out there given what Dupont announced yesterday.","Michael Foust","Yeah. I mean we have a very different portfolio than Dupont and they have a much more limited portfolio geographically and a highly concentrated customer base in the Internet sector. So it's really \u2013 I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's different and we have a much more diversified portfolio. So I don't have that calculation. My estimate is we're probably up \u2013 I don't know, probably over the overall portfolio 5% to 10% would be the roll off overall run rate.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","On a cash basis?","Michael Foust","Yes, I would say so. Because remember we have a lot of leases that are legacy leases and leases in assets where we've been done (inaudible) building leases many years ago. And those where the customer put the improvements in that were originally leased as an alternative use rents. Now we can see a significant uplift and that's been our experience with PBB type leases uplifts 10% to 15% from that component of the portfolio [rhetorically].","Bill Stein","Ross, we've had many over 20% uplifts on those PBBs. And if you look at the lease rollover schedule which I think is posted, you'll see there's a high concentration of PBB rolling over the next several years.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","But across the blended portfolio, you do think it's a positive mark, I think that's\u2026?","Michael Foust","Definitely.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","Okay. The other question is, I wanted to try to go back on the question that everybody's been asking about the backlog. I just want to make sure I understand how you're defining it? Are you defining that the $29 million backlog as those are leases that are already signed and set to commence this quarter?","Bill Stein","Yes.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","So in order to get to the 130 to 150 number for the full year to the midpoint of that, there's another roughly $25 million of annualized lease revenue that has to commence in addition to that backlog, is that roughly the right way to think about it?","Bill Stein","Yeah, 23 close enough.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","Okay, my rounding's off. Okay. But last question is, you had mentioned in the beginning of the call your role as a consolidator and I guess the question would be how does your \u2013 does the changing cost of equity capital influence how you think about the volume of activity that you would do going forward?","Michael Foust","We're very bullish on the opportunities and I think that's something that the market, I think, has not valued highly enough when you look at the increase in stable bottom line earnings as we've been able to deliver as a consolidator. And I think we'll continue to have our cost of capital advantage in the marketplace along with \u2013 what's very important too is our technical expertise, that's very attractive to sellers because they know we understand the product, they know we have the wherewithal to close. And that's going to continue to serve us very well and drive very stable increasing earnings as well as additional operating scale. And many of these come with value-add opportunities as well. So we're still quite bullish on our opportunities there.","Bill Stein","Ross, the other point there is the portfolios that are out there, if they're large enough they're looking to a possible public exit. And clearly the multiples for the public exit have changed a fair bit in the last month, if you assume that that will be trading to some discount to DLR and the other public companies.","Ross Nussbaum -- UBS","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie","Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Ross' question on pricing. Where is pricing today in rough order for sort of older seven to 10-year-old Turn Key space in a market like Northern Virginia as the leases there roll versus where you're putting people in a price point basis for brand new space that you're bringing online?","Michael Foust","We don't have much of that, because our portfolio is pretty new, in that market. But I would say on renewals, we'll continue to see a high renewal activity that we would expect close to market rents, unless the tenant has a fixed uplift in their renewal option. But we don't see much difference because in our portfolio and we've seen this in other markets where we have tenants renewing leases on 10-year-old space and that space is extremely functional, especially since we've seen \u2013 we have not seen much of an increase in terms of power densities.","So folks in terms of UPS, usually where they have to upgrade the space of adding more UPS, and which we'll do from time to time and especially if its telco space that we want to turn into enterprise data center. But the space is very functional, especially with the corporate enterprise or for your cloud and managed services, IT colo companies, they want space in that 100 to 120 watts a foot. We built space in excess of 200 watts a foot for customers who want this, but we take that space as very competitive.","Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie","Okay. So you're saying that the perception out there while new space \u2013 brand new space maybe something on the order of 130 bucks that \u2013 this perception of a 10-year-old space as it renews is going down to $90 or $80 on a comparable basis is incorrect from what you've seen through your portfolio?","Michael Foust","That is incorrect. It's absolutely not the case.","Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie","Okay. And then just for Bill, the $29 million of backlog, does that include what you guys have signed in October?","Bill Stein","No, it doesn't. That would be additional.","Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie","Okay. Is there a number that you guys have out there for October that you can give us?","Bill Stein","We really don't disclose quarter end data. We certainly have signed leases since the quarter commenced, but we don't disclose that information.","Rob Stevenson -- Macquarie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Bill Stein","We could, it's just \u2013 it gets messy when you start talking about partial quarters and a little confusing.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of George Auerbach with ISI Group.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","Great. Thanks. Bill, you mentioned within the accounts payable or other accrued liability or liability you recorded for difference in GAAP and cash, I guess book basis on the Sentrum Portfolio. What was the amount of that liability and for that purposes, should we view that as a sort of non-economic liability?","Bill Stein","Yeah, the deferred tax liability is 111 and that's timing differences between GAAP and tax.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","So I guess is that now your real liability that we should sort of back out for that purposes?","Bill Stein","Yeah, I mean it will \u2013 that will be amortized, that liability will be amortized over the term of the lease.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","Okay. And I guess so early\u2026","Bill Stein","Cash is going to go out the door to pay taxes, but the tax going out the door to pay the taxes on a cash basis will be different than the expense that's recognized.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","Okay. And I guess the last question on the backlog from me, early thought on the '13 commencement, I know this year it's sort of in the 130 to 150 range. Can you just give us a sense, early thoughts on next year, is that number same, higher or lower than the '12 number will be?","Michael Foust","I think we'll certainly be at least on par. It's probably \u2013 it's early yet, but we're thinking it should be a little higher.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","And also on the development spend line, I think this year's 700 to 800, early thoughts on next year?","Michael Foust","It's going to be on pace. We're kind of going as fast as we can. So I think it will be very similar.","George Auerbach -- ISI Group","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc.","Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc","I'd just figured I'd follow-up on George's question there, any early thoughts on FFO for next year? That's a joke. There seems to be a big disconnect, Mike, between your tone and view of the world, the demand set, I mean for your product and for what's going on in the technology sector relative to everything else in the world. And the stock's performance, you stocked down 25% from the peak three months ago.","We look at \u2013 everybody on this call -- a lot of people on the call look at real estate from all walks of life, I mean the demand argument it seems almost indisputable on some level for your space relative to everything else we have to look at. What's the disconnect here? What seems to be the problem, do you think?","Michael Foust","I think folks would be well served spending more time looking at the secular technology drivers that drive demand for growth and IT application, growth in broadly IT services, what they're companies are doing in terms of consolidating all these, just for data centers in a closet and getting them into new modern facilities. Looking at a lot of this, the basic research that folks like IDC, Forrester, Gartner, Tier One Research, these folks do deep dives into the secular demand drivers and specifically about demand for data center space broadly.","So if you look at, at the growth in folks that are providing managed services, cloud services, content distribution, many, many who are customers and growing customers in addition to the enterprise sector, I think you'll see a lot of that information pretty clearly communicated and defined out there. And I think maybe folks haven't dived into that information that that would be very worthwhile.","Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc","So I am with you, I understand the demand side. The market is suggesting something else, right? There are other issues and they're keying off of things that are actually going on in the world, right? DFT's report yesterday, I know you guys are very different. Your report today, even though demand is \u2013 I think you said stronger than ever and busier than ever for your sales guys, your commencement guide is down for the second quarter in a row. That's not something we have to come to expect from Digital Realty Trust and that's because of your track record that you've established. So what's changing that we're sort of getting this negative stimulus, if you will, in the most recent months? I mean you mentioned the elongating of the sales cycle 90 days ago or so, but I mean is there anything else out there? Is it supply? Is capital just more available?","Michael Foust","Well, I mean certainly there is more competition in certain markets but a big driver for us is that our \u2013 one in particular the Asia-Pac market, we've had a couple of slow quarters and that is \u2013 in terms of lease commencements and signings and that's picking up. So I think Singapore and Australia probably have had a bigger effect and I think that's \u2013 you're talking about a small dataset of deals and we'll see the activity in Asia of signings and commencements pick up here over the next three or four months based on what we're working on.","Bill Stein","Jordan, our plan assumed that [Jurong] \u2013 our initial plan assumed that Jurong would be basically full at the end of this year. It's probably going to be full mid next year. So that's a six-month delay.","Michael Foust","We've got tenants that we're negotiating with and engaged with for almost the entire building there and we've got good activity on the new Sydney building. So we feel good about the activity. It's just the timing is a little different than we initially anticipated at the very beginning of the year.","Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc","I mean you guys are consolidating this space, right? You're the consolidator of this space, the biggest player in this space in terms of network neutral data centers, in terms of controlling real estate and there's a couple other public players and some increasingly better capitalized small players but not that many new players from what I can tell and you're going to be buying some of these guys that are already out there. Don't you have the ability, and I step lightly here to sort of control price? I mean it's all about supply and demand. So demand we know. Supply is all about you and another guy? And one of the other guy is only in four markets.","Michael Foust","You have competitors in all the markets, many of the markets that we're at a premium over, but they're keeping their lease rates flat. And also remember too there comes a point where you just can't keep going up on rate because customers will start to consider alternative build to suits for themselves and go back to owner-occupied models. So we want to be mindful that we want to get deals done and not have folks reconsider owner-occupied and we do a lot of\u2026","Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc","That's not what IDC is saying, right? You read it. And we haven't heard of a lot of \u2013 the bigger guys even building for their own account recently.","Michael Foust","But people will consider building themselves. You don't have infinite pricing or else we have Manhattan \u2013 we have Los Angeles or distribution states of $50 a foot. I mean it's not an infinite upward trend and there are competitors, you got folks like CyrusOne out there and they compete on price. Some of the other folks that you mentioned compete on price. We compete on quality of service and hiring (inaudible) uptime in our deep professional staff for liability security. It's where we'll achieve a bit of premium, but you got a whole world of corporate services (inaudible) brokers and their job is to represent their customers aggressively and that whole real estate world. So you just can't price all the time with a continuous upward trend, but we're at very attractive 13% average on the level of returns on costs this past quarter. So we're pretty happy on the type of returns we're achieving on our developments.","Jordan Sadler -- KeyBanc","Thank you. I'll yield the floor.","Bill Stein","I'd like to make a clarification on the signed and commenced for the quarter, the midpoint's 28. So, 18, 38, the midpoint's 28.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Johnathan Schildkraut with Evercore Partners.","Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners","Thank you for squeezing me in. Actually most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I would actually like a little bit more color on how the backlog works? Historically or traditionally I would have imagined that you have a backlog number. You do some signings that goes into the backlog. You have commencements, that comes out of the backlog. But that math doesn't seem to work. So if you could just explain how this backlog works, it'd be really helpful? Thanks.","Michael Foust","That is how it works. And we define backlog as signed leases. And we usually refer to prospect as our prospect funnel. So backlogs are our signed leases and then once those leases are commenced, then they're out of the backlog.","Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners","Okay. Because last quarter you said you had $41 million in backlog and you pretty much signed and commenced the same amount of leases and now you have $74 million in backlog. Is it that $41 million in backlog was only reflective of 2012 and there was always separate 2013 backlog?","Michael Foust","Yeah, it's kind of a continuous process.","Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners","All right, great. There's been a lot of speculation that New York Stock Exchange is going to look to unload its two buildings, I guess one over here in New York and one in the UK, and I was wondering if you had any perspective on that and whether those would be attractive assets?","Michael Foust","Conceptually, there would be attractive assets. Always one has to look at comparison to replacement costs because both \u2013 and our understanding is both of those assets would have a considerable amount of vacant space, vacant space that also needs to be built out. Our understanding is there's a lot of shelf space. So any investment in properties like that, you have to be able to have a view that you could build out this space and be competitive in the market with other space including space that we would build. So I think a big question there on kind of the investment [thesis] would be, can you be in at a \u2013 all-in at an attractive basis that would make you competitive leasing out the vacant space.","Johnathan Schildkraut -- Evercore Partners","All right. Thank you for taking the questions.","Michael Foust","Sure thing.","Operator","I would now turn the conference over to Michael Foust for closing remarks.","Michael Foust","Great. Thank you, everyone and thanks for the great questions and comments. As always we're available to discuss and we very much value your observations and comments in the market and in our business. And I do want to congratulate our team here at Digital who are doing a terrific job and working hard to take advantage of the opportunities here. So thank you team and once again, thank you all for your time. Appreciate it today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will end approximately after 60 minutes. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Stewart","Thank you, Andrea. The speakers on today's call are CEO, Bill Stein, and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Greg Wright, and Chief Technology Officer, Chris Sharp, are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements including guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For further discussion of risks related to our business, see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.","This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Bill Stein, I'd like to hit the tops of the waves on our first quarter results.","First and foremost, we continued to support our customers' global expansion requirements with an agreement to anchor development of a new campus in Santiago, Chile. Next, we demonstrated our commitment to deliver a sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy procurement and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, our 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Last but not least, we further strengthened the balance sheet, redeeming high coupon debt and preferred stock, lowering our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points while simultaneously extending our weighted average duration by more than half a year with the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.","William Stein","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. During the first quarter of 2019, the Digital Realty team continued to effectively press our competitive advantages. We capitalized on the strength of our comprehensive multiproduct offering by capturing healthy enterprise demand across multiple regions. We also advanced our private capital initiative by closing our joint venture with Brookfield and we further strengthened our balance sheet by locking in fixed rate long-term capital at attractive coupons.","We continued to build upon our industry-leading commitment to sustainability and sound corporate governance, setting the stage for sustainable growth for all stakeholders. We further expanded our global platform with strategic land purchases in Tokyo and Singapore, as shown here on Page 3 of our presentation, and finally, we announced earlier this afternoon that we are entering Chile, Digital Realty's 14th country, with a 6-megawatt facility underway slated for delivery in the third quarter of 2020. Our strategy for new market entry is to follow our customers, and Chile is no exception. We are pleased to be supporting the growth of a leading global cloud provider who will be anchoring the first phase of our campus in Santiago.","Chile is one of the most economically and politically stable countries in South America and is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank with a clearly quantified business-friendly investment climate and the highest per capita GDP in Latin America. Our Chilean operations will be conducted by the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, our exclusive vehicle for data center investment in South America. It's obviously still early days since we just closed on the acquisition of Ascenty in December and the joint venture with Brookfield at the tail end of the first quarter, but and we are encouraged by our partnership with Brookfield, the early execution by the Ascenty team and the compelling growth opportunity within the region.","We also continued to advance our ESG priorities over the past few months, highlighted here on Page 4. In January, we issued the first-ever data center green euro bond. Late January, we announced a long-term renewable power purchase agreement to secure 80 megawatts of solar power on behalf of Facebook to support their renewable energy goals. In late February, our Board of Directors submitted our corporate governance guidelines to clarify that director-candidate pools must include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender. Finally, our Board also approved a proxy access standard for stockholders in late February.","We are committed to sustainability and sound corporate governance principles and we are focused on delivering sustainable growth for our customers, shareholders and employees.","Let's turn to market fundamentals on Page 5. As most of you are aware, 2018 was a record year for data center net absorption and the primary metros across North America are still in digestion and restocking mode. To provide some context, North America represents approximately 80% of our total revenue and was responsible for 75% of our 2018 leasing activity, but only half of our current availability is located in North America. The same dynamic is true in [states] for Northern Virginia, our largest market at over 20% of total revenue. It accounted for 40% of our 2018 bookings, but less than 15% of our current availability. We expect to see a pickup in North America data center absorption in the second half of the year as data center providers restocking their shelves with inventory coincides with the next phase of hyperscale users' incremental growth requirements, taking adjacency next to existing applications and continuous runway for growth on our campuses.","In Europe, recent leasing activity has been dominated by global cloud service providers who continue to sign expansions throughout the major metros. Data privacy and sovereignty rules are driving a distributed architecture, forcing cloud providers to establish a presence in all the major metros. So these expansions generally come in smaller increments than the hyperscale deployments in North America. Last year was likewise a record year for absorption in Europe with leading cloud providers deploying multiple megawatts across major metros. These cloud providers also exhibit a clear preference for expanding adjacent to existing deployments. So landing the initial deployment is key. Our Global Connected Campus strategy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this consumption pattern.","Across the Asia Pacific regions, supply remains largely in check. The complexity of local regulatory frameworks, the difficulty of procuring power and the limited availability of sites with adequate connectivity all serve to limit competition. Demand is outpacing supply in several of our key APAC markets, notably, Singapore, Tokyo and Osaka. This is translating into solid execution and pipeline targeting our near and medium term available inventory in these markets, setting us up for attractive backdrop as we bring adjacent capacity online at our Singapore and Osaka campuses, in addition to our recently announced Tokyo campus development project.","At the macro level, the Asia Pacific region is still likely in the very early stages of its communications infrastructure build-out, and we see a significant runway for growth for years to come.","Finally, our pipeline of existing customer expansion and new customer opportunities is growing in both Brazil and now Chile, where we are the market-leading data center provider. On balance, we believe customers view our global platform and comprehensive space, power and interconnection offerings as key differentiators in the selection of their data center provider.","Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 6.","Global economic expansion remains intact. The U.S. unemployment claims recently dipped below 200,000. Interbanks the world over have adopted a dovish stance and the risk of a full-blown trade war appears to be receding. As you've heard me say many times before, we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers, both growing faster than global GDP growth and somewhat insulated from economic volatility. The hyperscale data center customers who drove outsized demand in 2018 marched to the beat of their own drum. Although they have largely remained in digestion mode in the early days of 2019, we remain highly confident in the longer-term trajectory of this demand. In addition, the resiliency of our business model enables us to capture robust and diverse demand from a broad swath of customer verticals across geographic regions around the world, as evidenced by our first quarter results.","To put a finer point on the secular demand drivers underpinning our business, I'd like to highlight a couple of the points on Page 7. According to Synergy Research, the total cloud market ecosystem passed the $250 billion revenue milestone in 2018, up 32% from the prior year. Separately, according to an IDC global study of 800 enterprise cloud users, 58% of respondents are now employing a hybrid cloud model, defined as using private and public resources for the same workload. Finally, an IDC study of 400 users of public cloud compute and storage services found that over 50% have recently moved the workload back on-premise. To effectively address the hybrid multi-cloud market, data center providers must offer a global interconnected solution from colocation to hyperscale. These trends obviously play directly to our strengths, help explain the durability of our recent results and bode very well for future demand cycles. Given the resiliency of our industry, our business and our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with our leasing activity here on Page 9. As Bill indicated, our first quarter results highlighted the durability of the Digital Realty global platform with balanced performance across the regions, product types and customer segments. We signed total bookings of $50 million, including $9 million from Ascenty, a $7 million contribution from interconnection. We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million with a weighted average lease term of 10 years, including a $7 million colocation contribution. 5 of our top 10 deals in the first quarter were outside the U.S., including several top customers who were able to leverage our global platform to enable their growth across regions. For example, this quarter, we enabled the expansion of a cloud infrastructure provider, that specializes in helping developers launch applications into the cloud, helping them better serve their customers on the West Coast as well as APAC. Within our global account segment, we landed 2 sizable deployments north and south of the border with a leading global cloud service provider. Separately, we also landed a network edge node from another leading global cloud service provider, which we expect will enhance the interconnection profile of our campus in Dallas, Texas. We continue to track healthy demand within our global account segment, but the cloud accounted for just 1\/3 of our first quarter bookings, as shown on Page 11.","On a majority of our new business during the quarter was with existing customers, we added 43 new logos, with a particularly strong contribution from our enterprise segment. For example, a well-funded software startup leveraging artificial intelligence to develop safe and reliable technology for autonomous vehicles selected a Digital Realty data center to help their production application and deliver their technology on a global scale. Afterpay is a global fintech provider based in Australia providing a \"buy now, pay later\" payment platform. Their proprietary decision-making engine determines creditworthiness of their retail customers in a near real-time on a global scale, and they are leveraging service exchanges from earning their gateways in the U.S. and in Europe to simplify, scale and improve the user experience. We continue to see traction from European-based organizations keen to partner with a data center provider able to facilitate their global growth well into the future.","A multinational semiconductor and software design company headquartered in New York selected Digital Realty to provide a global data center strategy to support the transition of their business services as the decommissioned data centers and extend their business reach. In particular, the partnership will facilitate their ability to extend their presence into Singapore in support of their APAC initiatives. They will now be able to deliver a full global services capability supported by Digital Realty in each region of -- around the world.","In addition, a British satellite telecommunications company is expanding with us in Europe to provide further colocation solutions for their London and Amsterdam operations. The solution underpins the infrastructure required to support the launch of their new satellite later this year and will provide high-speed broadband services to their customers.","Channel partners continued to contribute to our business and comprised 15% of our first quarter colocation and interconnection bookings and accounted for 25% of our new logos. One of our top channel partners brought us an opportunity to support a digital health care company that is redefining the way cardiac arrhythmias are clinically diagnosed by combining their wearable bio-sensing technology with cloud-based data analytics and machine learning capabilities. Their primary business model requires extensive data mining to help doctors predict and respond to cardiovascular events. The customer's proprietary cloud solution within Digital Realty required access to Azure, AWS and Salesforce cloud services. Digital Realty won the business by providing a superior low-latency and HIPAA compliant solution with the ability to connect to multiple cloud providers throughout our interconnection services, including Service Exchange.","We're also seeing traction with the strategic relationships we have forged with leading cloud and managed service providers. For example, we're engaged with one of our global cloud's hyperscale customers to provide best-in-class ultra low-latency hybrid services to end customers with specific performance requirements.","We're also teaming up with a major storage solution provider who offer services to end customers who wants to deploy private infrastructure in close proximity to the public cloud. Alliances like this greatly expand Digital Realty's addressable market and demonstrate our unique capabilities in terms of ubiquitous cloud interconnection and near-field proximity to underlying cloud infrastructure around the globe.","Turning to our backlog on Page 12. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stood at $144 million at the end of the first quarter. I'd like to point out here that the current backlog shown on Page 12 reflects the full contribution from Ascenty, whereas the Ascenty contribution will be shown in our 49% pro rata share going forward. The weighted average lag between the first quarter signings and commencements remained tighter than our long-term average and a little over 2 months.","Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 13. We signed $116 million of renewals during the first quarter, in addition to new leases signed. This is the second highest quarterly renewal leasing volume in our history, right on the heels of the all-time high of $138 million in 4Q '18. The weighted average lease term on renewals was nearly 13 years, while cash rents on renewals were down 6.9%, driven primarily by strategic portfolio transaction as a single customer deployed a multiple powered base building shell as well as fully built-out turn-key capacity in 15 sites across our global platform. We renewed their footprint for 15 years on triple net lease terms, walking in these cash flows for years to come and maximizing the value from these facilities. We also effectively tied the strategic renewal to a multi-region expansion opportunity with the same customer.","Excluding global relationships that have signed an incremental $15 million of annualized GAAP revenue over the past 6 months, the mark-to-market on first quarter renewals would have been essentially flat on a cash basis, as you can see from the data points on the bottom of Page 13. This incremental leasing activity is a prime example of what we mean when we talk about our holistic, long-term approach to customer relationship management. We believe we have a distinct advantage when we are competing for new business with a customer we are already supporting elsewhere within our global portfolio. And whenever we can, we try to provide a comprehensive financial package across multiple locations and offerings, including both new business as well as renewals.","In terms of first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 40 basis points to 88.6%, half due to development deliveries placed in service in Amsterdam and Chicago and half due to customer move-outs in Silicon Valley and Dallas.","The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen over the past 90 days and FX represented roughly a 100 basis point headwind to the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line, as shown on Page 14.","Turning to our economic risk mitigation strategies on Page 15. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. In addition to managing foreign currency exposure, we also mitigate interest rate risk by proactively terming out short-term variable-rate debt with longer-term fixed-rate financing. Given our strategy of matching the duration of our long-lived assets with long-term fixed-rate debt, a 100 basis point move-in LIBOR will have a less than 1% impact to full year FFO per share. Our near-term funding and refinancing risk is very well managed and our capital plan is fully funded.","In terms of earnings growth, core FFO per share was up 6% year-over-year or 7% on a constant currency basis and came in $0.10 above consensus. Delta relative to prior expectations was primarily due to interest income on the Brookfield joint venture funding as well as tax benefits due to a reduction in the corporate tax rate in the U.K., which came in effect during the first quarter.","In terms of the quarterly run rate, we expect to dip back down in the second quarter due to the deconsolidation of the Ascenty joint venture going forward, the absence of the tax benefit in future periods and the forward equity drawdown, as you can see from the bridge on Page 16. We're revaluing in the second half of the year as several large leases commence.","As you may have seen from the press release, we're reiterating 2019 core FFO per share guidance. Most of the drivers are unchanged, with the exception of updating financing activity and a reduction to our same-store growth outlook. In addition to continued FX headwinds, the primary change from our prior forecast includes the \"blend and extend\" component of the strategic portfolio transaction executed during the first quarter and bad debt expense related to a subscale private colocation reseller. We also face a particularly tough comparison in the second quarter due to a sizable property tax refund we collected in the second quarter of last year, which also weighs on the full year same-store growth comparison.","Last but certainly not least, let's turn to the balance sheet on Page 17. Net debt-to-EBITDA remains in line at 5.5 times as of the end of the first quarter. Our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 3.6 times. Pro forma for the ins and outs of Brookfield's funding of the Ascenty joint venture and the forward equity drawdown, net debt-to-EBITDA is just over 5 times and fixed charge coverage is just over 4 times. Over the past several months, the Digital team capitalized on favorable market conditions to advance our financing strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs. In early January, we did all $500 million of our 5.875% senior notes due 2020. We also executed against our strategy of locking in a long-term fixed-rate financing at attractive coupons across the currency to support our assets with a green euro bond offering in early January. This was our second euro bond offering and also our second green bond, following the USD 500 million green bond released in 2015. But this was the first-ever data center euro green bond. The offering was well received, successfully raising gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion of 7-year paper at 2.5% while underscoring Digital Realty's industry-leading sustainability commitment.","Market conditions continued to improve over the quarter, and in late February on the basis of reverse increase from investors, we reopened both the 2.5% euro green bond offering due 2026 as well as our recently issued 3.75% sterling bonds due 2030. And we raised another $450 million of long-term debt at attractive coupons. We follow the same playbook with a perpetual preferred equity portion of our capital stock during the first quarter. We announced the reduction of all 365 million of our 7.375% series H preferred stock and we raised $210 million of permanent capital under our new series K perpetual preferred at 5.85%.","Finally, we advanced our private capital initiative, closing on the $700 million Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, a leading global asset manager. The successful execution against our financial strategy is a reflection of our best-in-class global platform, which provides access to the full menu of public as well as private capital, sets us apart from our peers and enables us to prudently fund our growth.","As you can see from the debt maturity schedule on Page 18, the recent financings have extended our weighted average debt maturity by more than half a year and lowered our weighted average coupon by 30 basis points. A little over half our debt is non-U.S. dollar-denominated, acting as a natural FX hedge for investments outside the U.S. Nearly 90% of our debt is fixed rate to guard against a rising rate environment and 99% of our debt is unsecured, providing the greatest flexibility for capital recycling.","Finally, as you can see from the left side of Page 18, we have a clear runway with nominal near-term debt maturities and no bar too tall in the out-years. Our balance sheet is poised to weather a storm, but also positioned to fuel growth opportunities for our customers around the globe, consistent with our long-term financing strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'd be pleased to take your questions. Andrea, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Atkins of RBC Capital Markets.","John Atkins","So two questions. One, on the sales pipeline, I was wondering if it looks measly different than earlier this year and late last year. Or do you see a greater mix potentially of double-digit megawatt opportunities as the company brings on more inventory? And are there any notable exchanges by region in Asia Pac, Brazil, Europe and North America as you sort of think about the pipeline rest of the year versus earlier? And then I have kind of a margin question more conceptually, do you see an opportunity to get sustainably past the 60% EBITDA margin level? Or is high 50%s kind of appropriate given your anticipated development pipeline or other investments you're making in the business?","Andrew Power","Thanks, Jon. This is Andy. Look, there's, I guess, still a handful questions in there, so let me try to unpack them. Overall pipeline, obviously, we're -- we don't only speak to a specific pipeline number. I think if you look at the composition of our signings in the first quarter, it's quite healthy across regions in terms of competition, size, the deals across industries, a great 43 new logos. So fairly healthy, and I think I've characterized the pipeline going forward consistent with that strength. Your question on the, I guess, more -- see more double-digit megawatt opportunities, say, on the whole, we've seen an increase in double-digit megawatt opportunities roll with additional inventory coming online. While that's been the case for Nashville or Dallas, Chicago, where we've been building out campuses for quite some time, it's been a little bit of a newer phenomenon in Frankfurt and Amsterdam or London or even in Toronto, and certainly Osaka, where, for example, where now these larger customers could see immediate inventory meets their needs, and you can see that runway to growth. So I do think you're going to continue to see that mix of more double-digit megawatt deals continue.","I think your next question was a little bit of kind of compare and contrast on the markets. I'll try to do that efficiently. Maybe starting in Asia, I think we've seen some great strength that Bill mentioned. Firstly, in Singapore and Tokyo, markets were literally trying to find extra capacity in the broom closet for some of our customers as it relates to the next leg of our campuses in SIN12 or our newest campus in Tokyo come online. Osaka, this is not to highlight there, where we are bringing on capacity in a series of adjacent campus-like facilities where our customers are growing with us in a nice smooth runway.","Hopping over to Europe, Frankfurt's going to highlight their great 3-megawatt signing to an IT service customer that had an enterprise customer that they exported from the U.S. into that market. We've seen some robustness there at a time where, I'd say, supply was quite limited.","Back in the Americas, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the competition was really Toronto. We're building upon our success there, and I think we've seen some incremental inbounds most recently there and some also -- some office -- the other wins in Dallas and Santa Clara. A little lighter on Ashburn, but that was very much subject to inventory. And then Bill kind of gave you a little preview of our entry to Chile and the success with Ascenty.","So the second question, just so I have it right, Jon, was about EBITDA margins and where we get to see that going from here. So I guess the midpoint of our guidance is to be at about 58% adjusted EBITDA margin. As a reminder, that's down over 100 basis points year-over-year from ASC 842 accounting change for the expensing of nonsuccess-based leasing compensation. Right now, I could tell you we're much more focused on expanding -- or actually I should say we're less focused on expanding our industry-leading EBITDA margin and more focused on growth. Over the longer term, I think it's pretty intuitive as we continue to scale our platform globally, particularly in new markets that I mentioned with more volume campuses and with greater times and scale. I do see a longer-term trajectory to further EBITDA expansion, pushing up closer to the 60% area that you mentioned. But right now, again, the focus is more prioritizing growth given the feel that we have quite a healthy EBITDA margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler","So first question is on guidance versus sort of the beat in the quarter. Andy, you touched on it when you went through Slide 16, which is always helpful. But I guess, just running the numbers as opposed to looking at the bars, if I backed the $1.73 in the quarter out of the $6.65, it implies that you're going to do $1.64 per quarter in order to get to the full year, or that's what you need to do, at least, which seems like a pretty sizable step down. I know you touched on some of the puts and takes, the Brookfield JV funding, obviously, is a little bit of a drag. The tax benefit, I guess, I could use a little bit of a better explanation for. And then separately, can you maybe elucidate what we should expect to happen on the forward equity a little bit better? Because at least in this illustration, it shows you taking down all of the forward equity prior to 2Q -- or before the 2Q bar? And then I'll have a follow-up.","Andrew Power","Sure. Thanks, Jordan. So I guess the components again. So Brookfield closed on its 49% joint venture the very last day of the quarter. So we had not anticipated that to take so long in terms of regulatory approvals and tax and legal structuring, but we did prepare for just in case, and they've compensated us for carrying their share in the investment with a current return. And that's, obviously, going to go away. So it's a bit of a onetime benefit to actually feel in the quarter. To a lesser extent, the U.K. corporate tax rates revised from 21% down with something slightly lower than that, I think, 17%. And obviously, we have non-U.S. dollar investments in London that we have to adjust our tax rate for deferred tax assets or liabilities in this case. So having a benefit to our core FFO, that appears in the quarter as well. So those are the things I'd say that contributed to the several pains of outperformance in the first quarter relative to our original guidance. And in terms of headwinds, that counteracted us in the quarter and also will counteract us in the full year.","I think I spelled out we had some bad debt expense. We have a more troubled private colo reseller customer that's a relatively small percentage of our total portfolio, but does provide some headwinds during the quarter. It certainly kind of dampened our same-store NOI pool year-over-year growth and also will provide a headwind to the core FFO per share growth on a full year basis. So I'd say, right now, consistent with prior practice, which is really a philosophy of not sending the starters into the locker room after 1 of 4 quarters, we do keep our guidance constant. And going to your question on the -- a drawdown on the equity forward, so there's a $1.1 billion gross equity. We have not drawn down on any of it. As you can see from the balance sheet at 3\/31, we had just over $800 million of revolver balance on the $2.6 billion revolver. We had about $130 million almost of cash on hand. Brookfield literally came in the last day so we couldn't even pay down the revolver with a portion of that till a day later. And I would say we're going to be drawing down a portion of it before the end of the second quarter. We took a little bit of poetic license on the chart. We're putting that bar just to the left of the second quarter bar, but I'd say the bulk of it will be -- bulk, if not all of it, will certainly be done by the end of the quarter.","Jordan Sadler","Just to clarify, the Brookfield cash doesn't -- didn't show up on the balance sheet at all. Is it because that's...","Andrew Power","I'm just stating we have a $127 million-or-so cash in the balance sheet at 3\/31, because that money literally came in that single day and we couldn't send the wire to pay down more revolver balance for that piece.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. My follow-up was more on sort of funding longer term. You've recently -- and maybe this is a good question for Mr. Wright. You've recently talked about a self-funding model potentially, and I'm just curious if we can get an update, maybe a few months into the year what it looks like as you've sort of gone after the market or have taken an assessment in the portfolio, how we should be thinking about Digital's funding and sort of harvesting of assets this year.","Gregory Wright","Yes, Jordan. Thanks for the question.","Look, I think, consistently, we've said previously, although our 2019 guidance does not include any of the disposition assumptions, we continue to remain focused on recycling capital and portfolio optimization. The company has a heritage to that. Bill was doing that 6, 7 years ago, and we continue to focus on those opportunities when they make sense. We're certainly continuing to evaluate the private markets as a source of capital, and clearly, what everyone know when we have anything to report.","And with that said, you can reasonably expect us to periodically sell assets, particularly nondata center properties or assets in markets that no longer fit our strategy. Specifically, we discussed selling certain triple net lease assets potentially as well as potentially joint venturing stabilized assets where we can pull out some of that capital. We would joint venture it and redeploy that capital into higher-yielding development assets, which we think is a prudent capital allocation strategy.","And look, I think, again, we haven't committed to any specific amounts and timing since. As Andy would touch on, we're fully funded through 2020. I want to say that it could be as high as a couple billion over multiple years, but again, no specific timing are announced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Funk of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Funk","Yes, just a couple, guys. I mean, first, Bill, during the call, you made some comments and expectation for maybe a pickup or an absorption in the second half of 2019 from a large to hyperscale guys. I hope you can connect that back to some of the comments we've heard in the last week-or-so from Intel, for example, unit weakness there; NTSI, talking about inventory oversupply. Contrast it with Microsoft talking about building out their global data center regions. Maybe help us pull that together and talk about your own -- your view on the second half pickup in absorption?","William Stein","So keep in mind in the first half, we really didn't have any inventory in Northern Virginia, which is our strongest and biggest market, and that's going to be coming on in the second half. So that, at least, will give us some product to sell. I could tell you that just based on conversations that we're having -- well, in fact, backing up, the purchasing cycle of these CSPs tends to be spiky. It can be -- it has been volatile. And not all CSPs buy on the same schedule and some buy in far greater quantity than others, and in some regions, see greater orders than others. I mean, in general, Virginia is the highest and we see smaller orders. Historically, we've seen smaller orders in Europe versus North America. So there certainly was a lull in the first quarter. And I think despite that, we did $50 million in bookings, so we're happy with that. And in some ways, we feel that the quality of bookings is better in the first quarter because it's -- we're less dependent on the large spiky CSP orders. But I have no doubt that those orders will resume in the back half of the year.","Michael Funk","Okay. And then you also announced the -- you talked it earlier, the Chile deal in the first phase. I think you announced the size of the deal. Any additional commentary on future phases, what that could look like, the timing, any kind of underwriting commentary you can give us as well. What kind of rates are you underwriting that at?","William Stein","Sure, Michael. I'd like to fill in some of the details here. So this is very consistent with our Digital Realty new market entry expansion. Purely customer-led. And this one, in particular, derisked by simultaneous customer signing and our control of land, and ultimately, start of construction. This is a -- initially going to be about a little over 6, 6.3 megawatts data center hall in Santiago, but has a runway for growth too. Could be another 20-plus megawatts with adjacency. So -- and I think on the heels of this, I think we'll likely see additional other customers looking to expand in this market as well.","Michael Funk","Okay. And then, real quick...","William Stein","Mike, you probably know it, but the initial structure is leased hall, and that is really a function of time-to-market. Our expectation is that we will purchase that asset.","Michael Funk","Okay. And then one quick clarification, Andy, if I could. So the adjusted EBITDA guidance, is that apples-to-apples, what you gave us at 4Q? I didn't notice some adjustments for the -- for Ascenty. So just to clarify, is that the same guidance, or was there a change there?","Andrew Power","Sure. The -- I think we gave you adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, not Chile EBITDA. But so I'd say, if you look across that guidance table for each of the assumptions and, ultimately, the output row at the very bottom, we've kept that on an apples-to-apples basis throughout without no change. I think if you go back to our initial guidance back in the first weeks of January, we did try to give you what '18 going to look like under the change in accounting for ASC 842.","Michael Funk","Okay. So no change, even though if I calculate the adjusted EBITDA. I look at the back of your supplemental, there is the difference with the unconsolidated JV and then the noncontrolling interest now contributing to that.","Andrew Power","No. I mean, no -- same accounting for the table and the -- from left to right on there. I mean, the only difference is Ascenty, Brookfield. We owned 100% of Ascenty from December 21 on through all but the last -- very last day of the first quarter. So we recognized consolidated or almost 99%, I should say, of that venture. It actually does only 1% interest through our P&L. And on the last day when Brookfield closed on its 49%, it slipped to an unconsolidated joint venture at the -- and ultimately, given it's literally 1 day, it really wasn't material enough for disclosure on the back of our financial sup. It will be next quarter when we own 49% for a full 90 days. And we did provide a reconciliation on our leverage stats for both net debt-to-EBITDA and fixed charge coverage to make sure you're apples-to-apples in numerator and denominator for our provider share of ownership on those cats.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael","Great. I guess just 2 high-level questions. Your -- Bill, I think in that last comment or question, you mentioned you've no doubt, I guess, to your assumption to the larger deals in the second half of '19. And I'm just curious is that based on recent trends in the last few weeks, in the last month? Or would you feel just as confident, call it, on January 1?","And then secondly, M&A. Obviously, it's been a key aspect of your strategy in the last several years. I know there's been some pushback on valuations, perhaps more recently over the last few quarters, if not a year. Are you seeing those change and are you seeing potentially more opportunities for you guys to do something than maybe you would have thought of just a few months ago?","William Stein","Sure, Colby, leet me -- I'll handle the first one and I think Greg can pick up on the second one. I wouldn't say that there's been any change since January that causes that. It's just a function of looking back over history and seeing what the buying pattern has been. Obviously the -- some of the CSPs have taken the very large blocks of space in the relatively recent past, which has taken some time for them to absorb. But if you've listened to the Microsoft earnings report today, their cloud business is clearly very robust. And I will assume that the other firms will report in a similar vein. And at the end of the day, you really need to procure a space to house these operations. And that's why we feel as we do.","Christopher Sharp","Yes. And just providing a little bit more color on that, Bill. A couple of the elements that we've been looking at the market is particularly around some of the services that we all see all these cloud providers launching. These services are becoming more complex and require a different type of infrastructure to meet their requirements. And so it's all about these huge data lakes and about the ability to do a cat cage or multi-megawatt deployments across our entire Connected Campus, which is where we still see every major provider out there launching a handful of new services every quarter. So there's -- all of that requires infrastructure to continue to meet the market demands of all the consumers globally.","Gregory Wright","This is Greg, responding to the M&A question. Look, I think when you take a look at the landscape right now, and so we've mentioned it before. We constantly monitor all opportunities, whether in the public market and the private markets, whenever it may be. At this time, I think your point is right. We're seeing a lot of potential M&A opportunities in the private market especially. And as you can imagine, given our position, we see everything. I think you also -- due to the fact that the pricing remains fairly robust, and that's true. With that said, I think we've shown our discipline and commitment in the past to only do deals that make strategic sense and we believe is the appropriate risk-adjusted return, and that's the way we're going to continue to pursue our M&A strategies. With that said, also another leg of that stool, it's not necessarily M&A, but we're looking at land purchases as well to continue to fund the company's growth. So the reality is we look at 3 different prongs, really: M&A, whether it's public or private; we look at both portfolio -- our private portfolio and one-off acquisitions; as well as land acquisitions. And again, this may change by market. But we go back and we monitor each market, determine what we think appropriate returns are and what our strategy is and what our customers are driving us in that market and weigh all those factors before we embark upon any M&A activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Rasmussen of Stifel.","Erik Rasmussen","Maybe just circling back in Northern Virginia. Obviously, there's a slowdown we're seeing -- slower absorption in this market. Hearing a lot of inventory in the market and putting pressure on pricing. But can you just kind of talk to some of those sort of dynamics in that market? I know from what we're hearing and some of the things that we've seen so far reported kind of all jives with maybe a second half pickup. But can you just give a little bit more color on what you're hearing from customers there and just some clarity?","Andrew Power","Eric, this is Andy. I mean, I'll try to tackle that. So we've obviously been monitoring this market quite closely. It's certainly the most competitive market in the arena. I would also say it's historically been the largest and have the largest amount of demand and most robust and diverse demand across all cloud service providers and enterprise customers. We've, as Bill mentioned, had a pretty great phenomenal success of latest 12-plus months, call it, close to 99 megawatts to the point where pretty much all of our existing inventory had been leased. So we came up -- although short, now we did not anticipate that was going to happen a year prior when we would have grown incremental inventory. I think the way we think about tackling that market, we are closely monitoring relative competitiveness. We are very, very pleased with the fact that we are selling to a very large and growing installed customer base. Many customers want to grow with that adjacency, adjacent suite, adjacent buildings, really a short walk across the road or a conduit for the fiber to be pulled. And many of these customers who have already landed with us have that game plan already rounded out incremental capacity they want to take once they're fully utilizing their existing suites. So having that installed base is certainly a competitive advantage to date, and I think that will bear fruit as our new inventory -- our latest inventory comes online in the back half of 2019.","The other thing I'd say is the tool we utilize in pretty much defending our rate of returns of profitability. And any more competitive market is really flexing the muscle of the global multiproduct portfolio and bringing together opportunities for our customer to grow in various supply constrained more rare and unique opportunities, be it Tokyo or Singapore or Osaka or Frankfurt or South America, kind of patching opportunities for these customers and not beholden necessarily do that private one-off competitor that has only has -- anything to sell is rate.","So obviously, more to come. I will be even more close to the front lines as we have inventory to sell against that market. But I think we've got a tremendous value proposition and some pretty good tools in our toolkit to make sure we maximize value for that market and for the company.","Erik Rasmussen","So great. And so what I'm hearing is that, even though you may have lost out or you could be losing out on deals, it's not like because of your competitive advantage in this installed base, if you lost or out on this sign of first go-around, that business will come back or maybe even customers are kind of waiting for that incremental capacity to come online. And again, it's not just a pricing game or if you had -- because there was a lot of capacity that's in that market and a lot of inventory. So is that a fair way to capture that?","Andrew Power","Honestly, I would say that the timing of inventory tightness and demand is taking a bit of a pause kind of coincided for us in that market. So I'm not sure we really lost out based on our look at the market in the first quarter. There was a tremendous amount of deals we lost out on, even if they were at more competitive rates due to our lack of inventory. And I think that goes back to some of Bill's commentary of there we landed large consumers of our product in the prior 12 to 18 months that often take kind of several months to digest in the restocking mode, and then come back and want to grow with that capacity with adjacency. So today, I don't think there's really any regrettable losses in that market of any substance, even with a fairly competitive pricing opportunities out there from certainly many of our competitors that do not have other value-add for their customers beyond just offering a new price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.","Michael Rollins","Just curious if you can unpack a bit more of the same-store NOI for 2019. As you look into 2020, how should we think about the change in same-store NOI based on the mix of business that you have in the renewals for next year?","William Stein","Michael, why don't I -- maybe I'll start with actuals and kind of bridge to guidance table, just to kind of put a -- make it more clear. So our same-store NOI came in at negative 2.5%. That's cash NOI year-over-year for the quarter. I would splice it into there were normal course business that would have had that number coming closer to 1% positive or at least 70 basis points positive, for sure. And we had 3 more episodic -- at least 2 or 3 more episodic headwinds that hit us during the quarter. I mentioned there's bad debt expense that is the net against the revenue and obviously the cash NOI from the coprivate colo reseller that is a customer within our same-store pool. We also have that global relationship multimarket 15-year renewal, which had a, call it, blend and extend component. The customer had like 2.5 years left and we pushed them out 15 years. And while we lowered the rate, which you'll see in our PBB renewals and some of our TKF renewals, those leases are now cut on in the 2.5-plus rate for now 15 years, which we think is a value maximization path there.","And then we also had some FX headwinds doing track with the dollar, because now then you hedge on an unlevered basis from the same-store NOI pool. So negative 2.5% as reported cash NOI. If you were to back out the bad debt, the FX and our strategic renewal, that would have been about 0.7 positive. I would say if you kind of then translate actuals for 1 quarter into guidance table for a full year, I would say about half of the decrease in the NOI is due to the bad debt expense and the blend and extend renewal. Again, that's not something we do every quarter or every year. We don't have that many customers that have that much capacity with that short of duration available to renewal at once, and you do renew it once and resets. And I'd say the other half, just overall, the FX, let's say the other half and just what I'd say we're seeing kind of outcomes on potential expiration, potential downtime for re-leasing. So nothing tremendously new, just maybe we're more cautious around looking at the same-store pool.","Before I let you get to your second question, I would remind you and others on the call, the same-store pool is one piece of the puzzle just like our cash mark-to-markets. We do a tremendous amount of business that have new leasing tied to existing renewals. I think we've called out that on one of the slides in the deck that our mark-to-markets have actually been flat on a cash basis and positive on GAAP basis, about 1% to 3%. And the subset was customers did $50 million of GAAP with us. So on a relationship return versus same-store versus renewed capacity splicing, it's actually accretive to our cash flow and to our revenue.","Michael Rollins","And then how do you think about that for next year?","William Stein","Next year, we're really finding our way through the major renewals this year. So we've talked about the big 15 sites strategic portfolio of customer that was not a CSP. We are just at the very beginning of the second quarter executed with a top CSP, a long-term legacy digital customer for about 250,000 square feet, 20-plus megawatts at a pretty attractive renewal, call it, 5 years in term. And I'd say that one is kind of through now. And I'd say other than 1 legacy renewal from a company we've acquired 12 years ago, we're really getting to, I think, finer waters here in terms of these renewal headwinds. And I think we'll talk a lot less about them in 2020 and certainly 2021.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Petersen of Jefferies.","Jon Petersen","Maybe just very quickly. I just want to think it's not in the guidance, I know people will keep asking about it, but I just wanted to clarify. So the onetime payment you got from Brookfield and the U.K. tax benefit, were those contemplated in the initial guidance or was that not expected?","William Stein","Jon, we did not expect Brookfield to close 90 days into the first quarter. We thought that transaction was going to close very early in the year. It's not prior to the end of the year, quite honestly. And now we didn't expect that in the guidance, but we're planning for that in structuring of our deal with Brookfield and part of our transaction with Brookfield in exchange for us to assure them a 49% share of the incentive business. As they've navigated their regulatory and legal approvals, they were to compensate us for fronting their capital for what ended up being called just over 90 days. So that was not contemplated and we did not contemplate the change in U.K. tax -- corporate tax rates in our guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Choe of JPMorgan.","Richard Choe","In terms of the commentary you made about focusing on growth, especially with the development coming on at the end of the year. Does it make sense that -- to look at the dividend growth kind of slowing to help fund the growth aspect? Or is that just kind of the law on large numbers? And if we can get a follow-up on how you think about the dividend growth rate, that would be great.","William Stein","Thanks, Richard. So I don't think this is a zero-sum game between dividend growth investing the platform for future top line growth. Really the dividend growth is predicated on really the growth in the taxable income as a REIT and ultimately our cash flows. We're now, call it, a 70% AFFO P\/E ratio. That's on the heels of our dividend increase of just under 7% last quarter. And as to CF figure, I think you'd see the cash flows grow onto '19 and beyond. I think you'll see the dividend kind of move -- waxed up. Always what I'd say, I'll lean towards not overdistributing and maintaining a good portion of our capital in order to prevent the lines on external markets for funding our developmental growth opportunities.","At the same time, we are certainly investing and focusing on accelerating our growth. I think that's a few points across the board. It's, obviously, I think, top of mind for our new Global Head of Sales and Marketing, Corey Dyer. We've made some changes to kind of accelerate the growth and to kind of further emphasize our focus on the enterprise customer seeking colocation and interconnection on a global platform. But again, I don't think this is one thing or another. These are both missions that I think we can deliver simultaneously.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Stein for any closing remarks.","William Stein","Thank you, Andrea. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our highlights for the first quarter as outlined here on the last page of our presentation. First, we further expanded our global platform, closing the Ascenty joint venture with Brookfield, securing strategic landholdings in key global metros and announcing our entry into Chile in support of our strategic customers' global growth aspirations. Second, we also underscored our commitment to delivering sustainable growth for all stakeholders with efficient and socially responsible capital raises, renewable energy contracts and corporate governance enhancements. Third, we raised the dividend by 7%, the 14th consecutive year we've raised the dividend, dating all the way back to our inception in 2004. Last but not least, we further strengthened our balance sheet with redemption of high coupon debt and preferred equity and the opportunistic issuance of $1.6 billion of long-term capital.","As I do every quarter, I'd like to conclude today by saying thank you to the entire Digital Realty family, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution.","Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in June.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John J. Stewart - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and CFO, Andy Power. Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future financial and other results, including 2016 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business, see our 2014 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to begin on page two of our presentation, by reminding you that delivering superior risk-adjusted returns is our guiding principle. That applies to the investment decisions under our control and it also holds for the investment opportunity, we expect to provide to shareholders.","In terms of our capital allocation decisions, that means mitigating risk on development by requiring significant levels of pre-leasing and building only into markets, where we have high visibility on demand. It means emphasizing profitability over velocity and preserving the flexibility of our balance sheet.","We are highly focused on the accretive deployment of capital, and we decline deals that do not provide us sufficiently positive spread above our cost of capital. We emphasize growth in our bottom-line on a per share basis.","In terms of the investment profile that we offer to shareholders, it means delivering consistent, uninterrupted growth in earnings, cash flow, and dividends per share throughout the business cycle, firmly supported by the underlying value of owned real estate.","Let's turn now to our platform on page three. We have made a very conscious decision not to directly pursue the enterprise vertical with few exceptions, such as our traditional bread-and-butter customers like financial services companies. We aim to enable our partners to serve as enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide.","In early December, we announced the colocation resale alliance with AT&T, as well as a direct link colocation partnership with IBM Software. I'm pleased to report that our partners and alliances program continues to gain momentum. And that these partnerships have already begun to bear fruit, contributing meaningfully to our fourth quarter signing total.","Through threes strategic initiatives, we have on-boarded some new target customers, such as a large and growing Asian multinational communications networking company. These wins certainly speak to our approach of supporting partners as they grow their business, while simultaneously leveraging a broader collective sales engine. This pipeline is also growing significantly, including international opportunities and several large expansions for deals signed in 2015, as well as numerous enterprise logos not pursued by Digital Realty's direct sales force, highlighting the value proposition of this partnership model.","Turning now to capital recycling on page four. We closed on the sale of a vacant industrial building in Franklin Township, New Jersey during the fourth quarter. This property had previously been held for redevelopment, but market conditions were unlikely to justify construction anytime soon and we determined to sell the property to an owner user and move on.","Subsequent to year-end, we sold the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $188 per square foot, at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. This former R&D manufacturing campus was likewise vacant until we were able to successfully re-lease it last year, significantly enhancing the execution we were able to achieve on the sale of this non-core asset.","We are now also under contract on the National four-property data center portfolio that we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. There are no financing contingencies, and we expect to close during the first half of the year. We've been quite pleased with the execution that Scott and his team have achieved on the sale of these non-core assets and this portfolio sale will substantially conclude our capital recycling program.","We do, however, continue to believe that culling the asset base represents prudent real estate portfolio management. And you can reasonably expect to see us periodically sell another asset here or there, particularly non-data center properties where one off assets that no longer fit our connected campus strategy. We've begun to shift from a harvesting mode to selectively investing to secure our supply chain and to carefully position the company for future growth.","As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, we acquired a land parcel in Ashburn, less than a mile away from our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately two million square feet and the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus.","We also established a foothold in Germany, a long-time target market with the acquisition of a six-acre parcel in Frankfurt during fourth quarter for $6 million. This parcel will support the development of a three building campus, totaling approximately 340,000 square feet and roughly 27 megawatts of critical load. We have begun the local entitlement process and expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year, subject to market demand.","Moving on to market fundamentals on page five. Most markets continue to gradually tighten. The data center demand backdrop remains incredibly healthy, driven largely by our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services.","We've seen a significant uptick in the size of the average scale requirement, particularly from the hyperscale cloud service providers. The caveat here is that these requirements can be quite lumpy and timing can be hard to predict. The lumpiness of the large footprint business is complemented perfectly by the consistent cadence of the colocation and interconnection contribution from our Telx line of business.","Andy will provide an update on performance against our underwriting targets. But suffice it to say, the integration is proceeding smoothly. We are pleased by the contribution Telx is already making to our quarterly bookings and we expect it will accelerate the overall growth rate of our organization. The Telx acquisition has introduced us to over 1,000 new logos and the combined organization is developing strong relationships with these new accounts.","Over the past two years, more than 80% of our traditional large footprint leasing activity has been repeat business with existing customers, highlighting the value of these new customer relationships and further underscoring the complementary nature of the Telx acquisition.","And now, let's turn to the macro environment on page six. Global economic growth has decelerated over the last 90 days, while volatility and uncertainty have increased. As I've said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or even the price of oil, although the drop over the last 18 months is striking. We have the good fortune to be levered to secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing faster than GDP.","It's worth pausing here to reflect on our performance during the last downturn, which you can see represented in some of the visuals on page seven. By way of reminder, we have generated positive year-over-year growth in dividends and core FFO per share each and every year since our IPO in 2004. And the great financial crisis was no exception.","Our total shareholder return in 2008 and 2009 also compared quite favorably to the REIT index as well as the broader market. During that capital constrained environment, it was corporate outsourcing of data center requirements, along with a prudently managed balance sheet that was responsible for our outperformance.","In the current environment, cloud adoption is the next generation of corporate outsourcing writ large. The cloud is gaining traction because it enables corporate enterprise end-users to achieve efficiencies and contain costs.","During a downturn, this becomes even more appealing. In addition, our target cloud service providers are generally mature, well capitalized tech companies and the cloud platforms are among their fastest growing business segments. Consequently, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to deliver steady per share growth in earnings, cash flow and dividends, whatever the macro environment may hold in store.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx, here on page nine. As you know, we closed the transaction in early October. I'm pleased to report that we reached our commitment for $15 million of expense synergies during the fourth quarter and we expect to realize the full run rate benefit of these savings in 2016. We also reached retention agreements with key personnel and we are well on our way to integrating the two platforms.","For the fourth quarter of 2015, Telx generated $89 million of revenue, an 11% increase compared to the prior year period. Revenues are split roughly 50-50 between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $33 million of cash EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Telx performed at or slightly better than our plan on all fronts. That momentum has carried on into 2016 and we remain on track to meet our underwriting targets.","Bill has already alluded to more than 1,000 new customers with whom we are able to establish a relationship as a result of the Telx transaction. Separately, Telx brought an additional 27 new logos into the fold during the fourth quarter as well, including new subsea cable systems, mobile operators, and content suppliers. The total number of cross-connects for the combined organization is now more than 60,000 and we believe that connectivity represents a significant opportunities for cross-fertilization. We told you on our last earnings call that the next order of business for Telx would be to transfer our existing colocation business at 365 Main, along with turning over pockets of available inventory within our Internet gateways.","I'm pleased to report that the transfer of 365 Main was completed earlier this month, and the build-out and transfer of approximately 10,000 square feet at 111 8th Ave. should be online by the end of the third quarter. In addition, our investment committee recently approved allocation of capital to build-out a dedicated colocation suite at Building J on our Ashburn campus.","We expect to begin selling into that market during the second quarter and to plant the Telx flag in Ashburn during the second half of 2016. While revenue synergies will mostly be realized beyond 2016, we have begun to see some early successes through the collaboration of our scale and colocation sales force, including a recent signing by a top SMACC customer in a new location within the portfolio for that customer. In summary, while the integration mission is not yet full accomplished, we are pleased with the progress and performance to-date.","Let's turn to our leasing activity on page 10. We signed leases totaling $36 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power.","In addition, Telx contributed $7 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the fourth quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for more than 75% of our lease signings during the quarter. Notable highlights include a multi-megawatt lease with a hyperscale cloud service provider at our Franklin Park campus in Chicago.","The weighted average lag between signings to commencements were 4.5 months; and as shown on page 11, the backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced stands at $84 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence in the first-half of this year.","Turning to page 12. The average cash re-leasing spread during the fourth quarter was a positive 15%, driven by robust mark-to-market on PBB renewals offset by a slight cash flow down on a much smaller sample size of Turn-Key renewals.","For the full-year of 2016, we expect re-leasing spreads to be flat on a cash basis and up in the high-single-digits on a GAAP basis. We do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and from time-to-time, individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter.","On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by market rent growth and a steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","Turning to our financial results on page 13, we reported 4Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.38 above the high-end of our guidance range. The outperformance was driven by a combination of several items, including a few cents for Telx operational outperformance during the fourth quarter and $0.01 or so for early achievement on our expense synergy plan; roughly a $0.01 for lower is specific operating expenses; and lastly, our overall G&A did come in a little later than we had expected.","FX represented roughly 150 basis points to 200 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top line to the bottom line. As shown on page 14, and we expect this to persist and perhaps some drag of similar magnitude in 2016. It is worth reminding everyone that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge. So, only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risks from an economic perspective. We are well hedged, with 89% of our net assets denominated in U.S. dollars.","You may have noticed from the press release that our guidance assumes $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion of long-term debt issuance. This may include a potential $500 million Euro bond, which would further enhance our natural balance sheet hedged and increase our U.S. dollar net assets to 95%.","Furthermore, we generally utilize excess cash flows to repay non-U.S. dollar debt or redeploy into local investment rather than repatriating back to the U.S. While our global portfolio exposed us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of cloud service providers and other strategic customers around the world, which represents a key competitive advantage.","We've attempted to frame our exposure to swings in currencies, interest rates, and commodities here on page 15. The overarching theme is that we benefit from our scale as well as the diversification of our customer base and geographic footprint.","I'd like to take a moment to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, shown here on page 16. A portion of decline in the fourth quarter was due to the elimination of the straight-line rental revenue that Digital previously recognized under our long-term lease agreements with Telx. The longer term trend, however, also reflects the improved underwriting discipline we have instilled over the past two years as well as the consistently improving data center fundamental landscape.","Our 2016 guidance calls for $10 million to $20 million of net non-cash rent adjustments, including straight-line rental revenue, straight-line rent expense and FAS 141 adjustments. Straight-line rental revenue and FAS 141 adjustments are fairly ordinary course for our REIT investors. These items represent non-cash revenue that is recognized on our books and is deducted from core FFO to arrive at AFFO. We expect these two line items together to total $35 million to $40 million in 2016.","This would be down considerably from $87 million in 2014 and $60 million in 2015, but does not get you all the way down to our $10 million to $20 million guidance. The offset is $20 million to $25 million of straight-line rent expense that Telx recognizes our long-term leases with third-party landlords.","In contrast to straight-line rental revenue, this is a non- cash expense that runs through the P&L and is added back rather than deducted from our core FFO to arrive at AFFO. When we first announced the Telx transaction, we stated it would be 1% accretive to FFO per share in 2016, but 3% accretive to AFFO per share. These straight-line rent adjustments are the primary reason, why Telx is more accretive to AFFO than FFO. And also, they are a meaningful contributor to our forecast for double-digit AFFO per share growth in 2016.","In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 60 bps sequentially, primarily due to a PBB move-out in Phoenix. Same-capital cash NOI was up 3.4% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up 4.9%. As you may have seen from the press release, we guided to 0% to 3% same-capital cash NOI growth in 2016, which is net of the foreign currency headwinds.","The 2016 forecast comes with the major caveat, however, Telx greatly complicates the composition of our same-store pool, since they were previously a customer in 11 of our locations. These locations are mostly Internet gateways and represent a big chunk of our stabilized portfolio. So, carving them out of the same-store pool would result in a much smaller sample size.","At the end of the day, we decided to continue to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place. Beginning in 2017, Telx will be included in the same-store pool and we will revert to a less theoretical presentation. In the meantime, however, same-capital results should be taken with a grain of salt.","Telx had a similar impact on our reported occupancy statistics. We previously reflected space leased to Telx as 100% occupied. Now, however, this space is shown on a look-through basis, reflecting Telx's utilization of the space. The look-through treatment results in a lower reported occupancy across the 12 properties where Telx has a presence due to Telx's lower utilization and a better lease-up potential with that space.","Irrespective of the complexities of portfolio reporting, we remain keenly focused on organic growth. We will be aggressively attempting to renew expiring leases at higher rates, keeping our operating expenses in check and being mindful of our cost structure.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 17. In January, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by $550 million. We also established access to a new tender within the bank loan market with a $300 million seven-year term loan. The facilities were well oversubscribed and we'd like to thank our entire bank group for their support.","I mentioned earlier that the midpoint of our guidance assumes $1.5 billion of long-term debt issuance. I would like to clarify that this total includes the incremental $550 million a five-year and seven-year term loans, which was put to bed with this refinancing.","As shown on page 17, the refinancing clearly \u2013 effectively clears up the left-hand side of the maturity schedule, we have clear runway with very modest debt maturities until 2020, with well-laddered debt maturities thereafter. In addition, fully rate debt now represents less than 15% of total debt outstanding, and we currently have $1.5 billion of undrawn capacity.","We also generate approximately $150 million of cash flow after dividends, and we expect to realize up to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales. Consequently, we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. Debt to EBITDA stood at 5.2 times as of year-end and we expect to remain comfortably below our 5.5 times target throughout 2016, with a balance sheet positioned for growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is regarding leasing and the overall environment. Maybe Bill or Matt, can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of the hyperscale cloud players and some of these larger requirements that Bill, you described in your commentary as lumpy and hard to predict.","We see some of your competitors landing some very large transactions during the fourth quarter and post-quarter end and just curious what you're seeing in terms of that? Is it harder to compete? Do you expect to see more of it? That would be great.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thanks, Jordan. This is Matt. Yeah, I think Bill nailed it in his opening remarks and good focus on the hyperscale activity, because those requirements really sort of form the foundation of what the demand was in Q4 and is and will be as we move forward in 2016. We see that demand as well as our regular demand accelerating, but we do have to keep an eye on the hyperscale requirements and the lumpy nature of those requirements.","We saw $36 million of revenue as a healthy pace for space and power in Q4. When you throw in connectivity that gets up to about $43 million in the quarter. And I think all of that is still a reflection of our desire to remain disciplined not just in challenging times, but to remain disciplined in good times as well. It's important to remember that we're seeing successfully signed deals at attractive cash returns. And as Andy mentioned in his remarks, we were happy to land one of those very large cloud deals at a 15-year term in Q4, and we expect to see that continue in the first quarter.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then perhaps as a follow-up, you mentioned the total number of cross-connects in the portfolio. Did you mention or could you tell us how many were added in the quarter and maybe anything that might be embedded in guidance as it relates to interconnection?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Jordan. It's Jarrett. We are tracking our cross-connect growth consistent with the colocation pull-through. As Matt indicated, that incremental interconnection business, the connectivity, we gave you some guidance on what that incremental $8 million was that contributed to the sales. And we're continuing to evaluate and roll out more details on the interconnection business. But, as Bill mentioned in his opening comments, we're very excited because it's very complementary, it's a great add-on and it's fundamental to the connected campus to drive those connectivity solutions.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good evening, guys. So, your 2016 revenue target for Telx, I guess, implies about 7.5% growth off of the 4Q run rate, but if I take the 4Q bookings you reported from Telx of about $13 million for interconnect and base rent, I guess that implies, alone, about a 4% increase off of that run rate, so it just seems pretty conservative there. I'm just kind of wondering what sort of incremental leasing assumptions you have embedded in there or should we just take that as \u2013 the $385 million-plus as sort of the low-end of the guide and you probably expect to come in above that?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Matt. This is Andy. So, I mean that the signings number, obviously, as you know, don't all come in the first day and kind of roll into the next period. So, it's not a direct correlation.","I think we feel good on the guidance or the numbers that we laid out for Telx from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, and it's going to be a combination of leasing up some of the unutilized space and selling incremental cross-connects and getting flow through on the revenue contribution.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean, how quickly do \u2013 I'm assuming that interconnect bookings probably commence quite a bit faster than your typical four month or five-month lag on normal scale bookings. Can you just comment on book-to-bill?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, colo, space and power could be a month to two months for deployment; interconnection would be overnight.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead. Mr. Atkin, your line is open for questions.","Okay. We'll move on to the next question of Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Great job with the last name there. So, I have two questions. The first is with a bunch of your current customers, CenturyLink, AT&T, Rackspace, all being in, what we'll call interesting positions, CenturyLink and AT&T looking to potentially sell some of the facilities to which you are the underlying landlord, and then Rackspace, depending on one's opinion, is doing okay as a company. Obviously, going through change in their own business model; has a lot of space that's being not utilized.","How comfortable are you right now with the exposure you have to these customers right now? And is there anything that you're doing to prevent or anything you can do to prevent any risk with these customers as you go forward?","Then my second question, the $43 million of new leases including the interconnects, based on your guidance that you have now for 2016, are you expecting that number to remain relatively stable through the course of the year or would you expect that \u2013 or is that assumed \u2013 or do you assume that in your guidance that that ramps even further as we go into 2016? Thanks.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll take the second one first. I mean, I think we thought that the signings from a scale and a colo and interconnection point of view was pretty good performance, and we see that run rate kind of continuing throughout the year, maybe a little bit of increase, as it relates to the colo and the interconnection piece.","And then going back to your first question and I'll let others on the team jump in. I mean, holistically, the best way is obviously to mitigate this are through diversification of your customers, your locations, your leases, maturities. We're always in constant dialog with our customers, making sure we understand their business and where it's going and trying to help them with their space needs.","I don't think there is anything on the horizon right now, either with a Rackspace, AT&T or a CenturyLink, where they're actually looking to contract from our specific footprints. I think some of the noise you're seeing in the market or on the news rags is more about folks, who some of them, excluding probably Rackspace, focusing on their core businesses and selling non-core businesses.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. Hey, Colby. It's Matt. And just to pile on a little bit to that answer. It's really quite the opposite, in fact, in some of the names that you mentioned, we saw upticks not just in last year's leasing, but also in the pipeline moving forward to 2016.","Important to remember that these customers, especially the customers that you mentioned that are on our top 20 list, these folks are flexing into new opportunities, moving from a capital-heavy to a capital-light perspective, and flexing towards focusing on their core objectives.","And the great part for us is that, we've got long-term leases in place with these particular customers, but we also have incredible relationships, and we've developed strong partnerships over all of 2014 and 2015, so that we know exactly what direction they're moving in and how they can use our facilities to benefit from that.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","And Colby, one final point from a legal standpoint, many of these leases require our consent in order to be signed.","Operator","And our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Hey, everyone. Just want to go back to some of the sources and uses. I just want to make sure I got this straight. So, on the $1.5 billion of debt, at the midpoint, I think that, Andy, you said that included the $550 million on the term loan, the upsize, but just curious, you also mentioned $500 million Euro bond potential. But given the disruption that we're seeing in the markets today, is that something that could be done today or do we have to see things calm down before that could actually even get off the ground? I mean, I know it's a mid-2016 guide, but just curious what the conditions are today?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Vin. You were correct in your first statement, so, of the $1.5 billion, $550 million was done in the first week or second week of the year, when we closed our bank facility, and that was incremental five-year and seven-year term loan.","The next leg of it, or just under $1 billion, could be a potential $500 million Euro bond. This would be \u2013 we've been to the Sterling bond market now twice and obviously, been to the U.S. dollar bond market many, many times. This will be our first entry to the Euro bond market, it really aligns well with our investments on the continent over there.","We've done some pre-work in terms of meeting with different folks over there and fixed-income investors. It's really opportunistic, so as you can see from our debt maturity schedule, it's really would be capital that would term out a portion of our revolver balance, that's pretty far out there in general. So, we're kind of playing it day by day and we want to make sure there is a stable and receptive market to go to, so you'll probably see us re-engage and looking at that even harder in the coming months.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then my second question, sticking with sources on the disposition side. It sounds like the four-data center asset portfolio, you expect to be, I guess well \u2013 I thought I heard in the first half, but end of first half of this year, but we have seen a fair amount of disruption in some of the CMBS markets and that kind of thing. Not that, that's a big factor for data centers, but just curious if that's having an impact on sales expectations? I know there's no financing contingencies, but just in terms of buyer pools and that kind of thing?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","So, we're quite fortunate that Scott and his team got going on this and worked diligently, really ahead of the game here. So, as you notice, we sold one property before the end of the year; we sold another one just beginning of the year. And in this portfolio, that you mentioned, is under contract without a financing contingency. So, I think, we got ahead of some of the supply coming to the market, in terms of data center assets. And I think we've got a good buyer for these assets and realistically, I think that, that would be roughly 75% of our \u2013 the $200 million or so in our guidance. So, we're pretty much through with the bulk of our DSBOs.","Operator","Our next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Just thinking about the commencements, I thought last call, you guys had talked about the commencement timing sort of turning back to more normal, I don't know what we'll call it, six-months sort of timeframe were actually lower now at 4.5 months. Is that just depending on the pool or the mix of the leases or is that where we should expect things to sort of remain going forward?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Manny, you're saying the time from signing to commencement?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I just want to make sure, we heard you correct.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Matt, do you want comment?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. So, hey, Manny it's Matt. I would still expect that the normalization will come out at that six month level. Remember the impact that Telx hit inside the quarter and that certainly had an impact on the 4.5 months","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sorry, just so I understand that wouldn't the impact get greater as sort of you do more with Telx, so why would that \u2013 why would Telx be sort of a factor now and not in the future?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","So, Telx, Manny, has a shorter time to commencement, that goes back to, maybe I think it was Matt's question, as he asked about. I said one month to two months from when they signed to take the space.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And keep in mind, Manny, that when you say, the question about whether Telx will normalize to 4.5 months across the entire year in 2016. There is also these hyperscale environments that may extend that period a little bit. So, we do still feel that six months is the accurate timeframe.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then, just if we think about the returns you get on one of those large cloud deal versus sort of your overall return targets or guidance, where would those two lie? Is it 200 basis point gap? Is it 400 basis points? Just, if you could help us think about that?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","On the large, hyperscale cloud deals that we've signed to-date, including the one, in the last quarter. They were, well, within our 10% to 12% range. Now, they're obviously closer to the lower end of that range, but they still kind of met our overall hurdles.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on New Jersey. You did say that, I think, most markets are tightening. You were blowing out of \u2013 or you've gotten out of one of your assets here in New Jersey. Just can you maybe talk about conditions there and sort of your appetite looking forward? And then as a follow-up, just maybe discussion a little bit about markets that are seeing a little bit too much supply right now or not much demand?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jordan, thanks for jumping back into the queue. We like the position that we have in New Jersey. There is an interesting transition happening that continues to have the growth that we have in the financial services, which \u2013 what we established ourselves in the New Jersey. But with the addition of Telx, in particular, our focus on content and cloud in that particular market is starting to add to the pipeline in a way that we hadn't seen before. So, I'm hoping that the pipeline is developing right now, will allow us to get to that good balance between supply and demand in New Jersey.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just markets where you're not seeing the strengths right now that you're a little bit more concerning?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, to go through strength of the markets. And as you know, Jordan, I look at that from a forward-looking pipeline perspective. We continue to see strength in Northern Virginia, incredible strength in Chicago, especially over the past few quarters. And in Dallas, continued support in Singapore, especially with Sing 11 (42:40), the new property coming online and maybe partially due to China demand moving over from the Mainland into the rest of Asia-Pacific. And then some continued strength coming out of London in the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content markets.","We do have a significant amount of those market ready, but more importantly, shell available inside New Jersey; and as I said, I'm looking that as an opportunity for us. And then we've identified a number of strategic assets where we've had opportunities to lease in the past and we've increased our marketing focus on those markets, so I'm hoping that our increased marketing focus will have a very positive effect, not just in those particularly strategic assets, but in our cash position as well.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jordan, just to add one thing. Going back to, I think your first question, I don't think we hit the nail on the head for what you were looking for. The cross-connects at Telx were over 55,000 just by itself, so Digital contributes about 5,000 to get over 60,000 combined. And on a year-over-year basis, that was about 7% growth in cross-connects on Telx standalone.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jordan, adding to the list of weak markets or weaker markets, you could probably put Houston on that list. And I think Phoenix is on the bubble.","Operator","Our next question will come from Richard Choe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. In terms of the interconnection revenue growth, should we see that ramping through the year? And is it going to be something that's more back-end loaded or the revenue is coming in right away? That's the first question.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","So, I just quoted you growth on actual cross-connects about 7%, I believe, the year-over-year rate growth is kind of closer to 8%, so it's combined pretty strong growth. I'm not sure, it's going ramp above that combined rate growth volume kind of in the mid to the high-teens, so I'm not sure that I can \u2013 I have a good read on the quarterly guidance, but we do see strong growth in terms of volume growth in the 7% range and rate growth are in the 8% range.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","And just to add on that, couple of things. We're now in a position to leverage the Telx product capability, on the Digital side, to monetize that at a higher level than we've done in the past. And we're now mining the data to who's connected to whom really to leverage the interconnection business and start scaling that and that will take a little bit of time, but it's definitely the SMACC focus that we're taking and the networking and the cloud providers are definitely interconnection-rich, as you see in the industry.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And just adding to that, Richard, I'd like to answer your question, so we're all going to jump in. In terms of timing, in particular, the revenue optimization procedure that Jarrett just described, we're expecting that to start to take effect at the end of 2016 into 2017.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, there's a decent amount of runway for growth on the interconnection side? It seems like it's just starting.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for circling back to me. I just had a couple of follow-ups. The first is coming back to Telx. I was wondering if you could share the churn assumptions embedded in your 2016 revenue target, or at least just remind me what the historical range has been there?","And then secondly, regarding the AT&T agreement with IBM to manage its cloud and hosting services, I'm curious if that has any bearing on your relationship with either customer and if that partnership includes the management of AT&T's NetBond offering?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. We're not giving guidance on the churn, but I'd say we're pretty much assuming in our projections that it was in line with historical averages. I don't want to give you all percentage, (47:11) but I thought it was like 0.6%, so relatively low. And then on your second question, I don't know if Matt, you would...","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. I'll be happy to answer that, Matthew. So, in the two agreements that you mentioned, the AT&T agreement, the IBM agreement. The AT&T agreement contains two main components and one of them is fairly far along; that's the reseller portion of that agreement. That has been significant and we've actually done joint trainings with our sales forces at our sales kickoffs and through \u2013 on multiple continents. And so, the progress being made on the AT&T side is fantastic.","And the progress on the IBM side is incredibly promising. We have a unique situation with IBM where we happen to have the core compute nodes located on our campuses. We happen to have colocation space and colocation experts in Telx right next to those core compute nodes. And we have the magic of Telx's interconnection as well as a number of products that are in the funnel to bring to market in the future to provide our customers with the ability to securely and privately connect at lower than 1.5 milliseconds, which is incredibly important for them, and we think that we are one if not the only folks who can provide that environment for our customers.","One small thing to clear up, NetBond is the second part of the AT&T agreement that we have; we don't manage NetBond as part of that process, but we do have a partnership with them, so that they can land NetBond assets on our connected campuses.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So, I was wondering of the non-SMACC verticals, if you had to choose maybe two or three that are showing promise for potentially outsized growth, what would they be? And then on the JV front, there's a couple of assets where you have a partial stake and I wondered if you had any thoughts of securing full economic and operating control of any of them? Thank you.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jonathan, thanks for getting back on the call. We certainly don't like to pick amongst the non-SMACC verticals, because we're very big fans of the SMACC verticals. But in particular, financial services for us, and to go one click deeper, financial technology, we think is one of the places that holds a lot of promise, not just for large scale deployments on our scale team, but colocation requirements on our colocation team and then multiple points of connectivity. It's actually probably one of the best cases you can think about, where these fintech companies have to connect to other providers, have to connect to other institutions and have to connect to consumers, so fintech within finserv is one of the exciting places that we found.","The Internet enterprises is another one of the verticals that we really like to have a focus on, not just because of our historical performance in those particular verticals, but because of the necessary growth that's coming out of some of the activities.","So, some of the both \u2013 the M&A activity that we see happening here as well as some of the divestitures creates for us an incredible opportunity. When one of our great customers decides to split into two large companies, sometimes we get double the opportunity. And I know I wasn't supposed to talk about anything inside SMACC, but we think the mobile vertical for us is one that's incredibly ready for us to continue to exploit, and with the expertise of Telx now on-board, we're well situated to be able to do that.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jonathan, on the JV front, really not much for me to report there; we have several great partners from different types of capital sources. There is no real activity underway there.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Andy, just a quick follow-up for you. The $0.03 of G&A outperformance, I guess you would call it, that you show on slide 13 of the presentation, what specifically drove that much G&A savings versus where you expect it to be?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I mean really the outperformance was just based on our internal estimates that kind of drove our underlying guidance. I'm not sure there's a one decisive thing that kind of calls out over any of the others, and I'm not sure all (51:42) that can be normalized into the go-forward projections either. It was a handful of things that kind of \u2013 going into a quarter where we acquired a company, went through integration, we definitely didn't think we'd come up light on the G&A front with overlapping teams in the midst of reorganizations, but we did it a little bit better than expected.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, it's actually Ross Nussbaum here with John Hodulik. A couple questions, guys. Obviously, the tone here, I think, has been pretty positive, but I guess my question is occupancy was down almost 200 bps year-over-year in 2015; it slid a little in Q4. You're guiding to kind of flattish for 2016 for the same capital portfolio. So I guess my question is, why isn't the occupancy rate of the core business trending higher given all the positive commentary I'm hearing here?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I think, basically we're looking at the occupancy going into the year, Ross, and seeing we have some renewals, we have some space that we've been seeing from coming back to us in the form of some PBB space, that was either dark space as a consequence of a former telco merger, there are some silver linings in that, because we're seeing some of our cloud service providers really engaging around taking that space. And we are just being conservative on our occupancy forecast throughout the year.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, if I could, your stock has obviously done quite well over the last four months or so. How does your, I guess, positive shift in your equity cost to capital here influence, how you think about additional acquisitions, and in particular, looking at, say, things like the Verizon or the CenturyLink portfolios? How do you think about cost to capital versus acquisitions and has that changed from the commentary, I guess, you had last fall, when you did the Telx deal and said you were just focused on integration?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Just let me go back to your first question. Because I think, I might have missed a piece of it. Just to make sure, we're all on the same page, the decrease in the total portfolio's occupancy by a 140 bps or so, as of this quarter, that was due to look through on Telx.","So, 11 or 12 locations were 100% occupied at 3Q 2015, and when then, we bought their business and they were not 100% utilized within their four-walls, that was a step down there. So, I just want to make sure, we didn't miss-communicate on that front.","Going back to cost of capital, the base plan, which we put out on our guidance, roughly seven weeks ago had sourcing usage plan that was funded through retained cash flow, a little bit from DSBO proceeds and CapEx below our 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA; while at the same time, funding a pretty large investment in our development pipeline, that's the base case plan, it doesn't require equity.","I think you could expect us to follow our past track record, if an opportunistic investment came about, whether it's some large scale increase in our development from landing a hyperscale deal or some M&A or other acquisition, we look to go the capital markets to keep our levered stats in line and equity is \u2013 time again been a part of that.","Operator","And our next question will be a follow-up from Colby Synesael of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","That response to that last question just begged me to ask one more. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation on whether or not you'll be interested in doing M&A this year or whether \u2013 wait to do something perhaps later on.","As it relates to the Telx acquisition and now that integration, is there a point where you will feel more comfortable doing a deal or is that time now? Just help us give some perspective on the timing on when you think you'd be ready to handle a fairly large transaction, considering everything else that's going on inside the company?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Colby. It's Bill. So, I think \u2013 and Andy said this in his remarks, but we think we've made really good progress there, on the Telx integration, we've obviously retained the talent that we thought was critical to retain. We have over $15 million of synergies there, coming into this year, which is great and we've established a joint go-to-market plan, and we've moved inventory from various Digital locations to Telx, both 365 Main, we're going to do that at 111 8th. And we've approved in our investment committee, the Telx side of Ashburn campus. So, all that's great. We're laying revenue synergies groundwork here for 2016, and we expect to realize that in 2017 and beyond.","I mean, I think what should be clear to you is, this is really a continuum. There is no clear point in time when you can say, hey, green light, we're ready. We make progress every day. We actually has a leadership team, we review that progress once a week on Monday, and there is work to be done.","But at the same time, we're open to look at other investment opportunities, other M&A opportunities and the criteria is what we've said from the very beginning, getting back to Ross's question, we wanted to be strategic and we wanted to be accretive. And of course, we'll finance it in a prudent manner, keeping the leverage neutral.","Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing comments.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our fourth quarter highlights as outlined here on page 18 of the deck. First and foremost, we closed on the acquisition of Telx and what was truly a transformational transaction for our company. Telx checked all the boxes for us. It was highly strategic and extremely complementary to our existing platform. It was accretive to FFO and AFFO per share in year one and it was prudently financed.","We reported fourth quarter results that were well ahead of the high end of our guidance range. The quality of our earnings is improving with the burn-off of straight-line rent and the contribution from Telx. Growth and cash flow is accelerating and we are poised to deliver double-digit growth and AFFO per share. We also took deliberate steps to secure our supply chain with the acquisition of a highly desirable land parcel in Ashburn. We also entered the Frankfurt market, a longstanding target.","Last, but not least, we also raised the dividend for the 11th consecutive year. We've grown the dividend each and every year since our IPO in 2004 and we remained committed to delivering superior risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders.","Finally, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution. That concludes our fourth quarter call. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to seeing many of you in Florida over the next several weeks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"6867":["Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  6, 2014  5:30 PM ET","Executives","John J.

The speakers on today's call will be Interim CEO, Bill Stein; Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; SVP of Sales & Marketing, Matt Miszewski; and Vice President of Finance, Matt Mercier.","In addition to our press release and supplemental disclosure package, we've also posted a presentation to the Investor section of our website to accompany management's prepared remarks. You're welcome to download the presentation and follow along throughout the call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that management may make forward-looking statements on this call.

Such forward-looking statements include statements related to the company's future financial and other results, including 2014 guidance and the underlying assumptions.

[Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon, and thank you, all of those who are joining us. I'd like to begin today by outlining our strategic vision for the company. We strive to enable our customers to build their future growth here, Digital Realty data centers around the world. We see IT as rapidly evolving from a cost center to a revenue generator. Corporate executives are widely coming to view data as a strategic asset. Data storage is a less critical function than the traffic and exchange of information. Against this backdrop, we believe proximity to major metropolitan areas such as London, New York, San Francisco and Singapore will take on renewed importance, not just for ultra-low latency applications, but for delivery of all matter of content to the broadest population bases with the deepest penetration of smartphones and connected devices. We are building a vibrant ecosystem that will enable our customers to exchange and transmit their data to myriad ultimate destinations as quickly and as efficiently as possible.","If we are successful at facilitating our customer's future growth, we will also be successful at maximizing the value of our 4-data-center portfolio, and creating meaningful value for shareholders in the process. Our global footprint is a key differentiating factor. Over 90% of the business that we signed in the first quarter was with existing customers. And no one in the industry can match our ability to facilitate customer growth on a global scale. We produce high-quality data center solutions, and our cloud and network-based partnerships are nurturing an ecosystem that will likewise lead to product differentiation.","This vision dovetails perfectly with our #1 objective of optimizing the return on our portfolio for driving improved return on invested capital through the lease-up of existing inventory. Matt Miszewski will have more to say regarding our progress on this front in his commentary.","We are also undertaking a review of precisely which properties constitute our core portfolio. We believe capital recycling represents prudent real estate portfolio management. You can reasonably expect to see us cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next several years. We expect to prune legacy, non-data-center assets, non-core markets and a handful of underperforming assets. Subject to our board's approval, proceeds will be used to shrink our capital structure on a leverage-neutral basis, which is to say, a portion of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt and a portion may be used to buy back stock, so long as we believe that the public market value of our portfolio is trading at a meaningful discount to its private market value.","We will also continue to explore additional joint venture opportunities, which may serve to provide greater transparency on the private market value of our Turn-Key properties, in addition to the Powered Base Buildings that seeded the joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors last September.","Our private capital initiative may also serve to demonstrate the significant value our development platform has created. Going forward, however, we are adopting a very disciplined approach in terms of taking on speculative development risk. For example, we now have the ability to deliver a data center pod in 12 to 16 weeks. So we no longer see the need to stockpile finished inventory, and we plan to transition to a build-to-order inventory program. Having a lease in hand before we build will enable us to reduce our risk profile, commit capital only for projects that meet our return thresholds, know our returns with certainty, and avoid accepting subpar returns under pressure. We offer a premium product and our ideal customer fully appreciates the value proposition that Digital Realty provides.","This discipline will likely cause us to pass on some deals. But we believe it will lead to a healthier industry dynamic, better returns for our shareholders and a better match between the product that we offer and the customer base that appropriately values our offering. In addition to discipline, however, we must be vigilant about meeting our customer's needs. We cannot just offer them any color Model T they want so long as it's black. We must pay careful attention to the market's evolving product configuration requirements and be sure that we are equipped to provide the product that our customers [indiscernible].","Finally, we aim to implement some subtle shifts in our corporate culture. First and foremost, we will place renewed emphasis on serving customers in addition to managing properties. In our business, customer focus and value creation cannot be separated. Increased attention to our customers' business needs and technological evolution will enable us to anticipate changes, market dynamics, as well as technological shifts, and allow us to continue to match our product to market requirements, ultimately increasing the value of our portfolio. We've also entered a new era of candid dialogue with all constituents, including shareholders, as evidenced by the recent steps we've taken towards improving our disclosure. We have assembled an incredibly talented team of professionals.","It is my mission to unleash the intellectual capital and creative energies of this reservoir of talent. One recent announcement that exemplifies both our efforts to unleash intellectual capital as well as our commitment to driving improved return on invested capital was Scott Peterson's promotion to Chief Investment Officer. Having closed some $6 billion in data center acquisitions, Scott is clearly one of the sector's most accomplished investors. But more importantly, he is also, in my opinion, one of the most astute. I could not be more pleased by Scott's well-deserved promotion.","And now, I would like to turn the floor over to him to provide further detail on our capital allocation strategy going forward.","Scott E. Peterson","Thank you, Bill. Over the past several weeks, we have begun to evaluate every single property in our portfolio as the initial step in an assessment of our long-term performance potential. The results of this analysis will help prioritize capital allocations, decisions -- capital allocation decisions, focus individual asset strategies, and will also help identify potential disposition candidates. The preliminary conclusions of this analysis are that we have a substantial portfolio and it isn't going to turn on a dime. Improving our return on invested capital will be measured in basis points and it will be achieved over time.","The only investment activity we closed during the first quarter was the contribution of a fully-leased data center for our existing joint venture with the fund managed by Prudential Real Estate Investor. This property is located in New Jersey and is fully-leased to a AA-rated financial services tenant with over 9 years of remaining lease term. It was contributed to the joint venture at a 7.1% cap rate, fully loaded for all closing costs and debt prepayment penalties.","In early April, we sold a small single-tenant building to the user for approximately $42 million. We expect to book a gain on the sale of approximately $16 million in the second quarter. The only notable third-party transaction during the first quarter was Amerimar's acquisition of 401 North Broad, an Internet gateway in downtown Philadelphia. This property reportedly traded at a high 7s going-in cap rate, which does not include an estimated $70 million of projected CapEx, which would put the cap rate solidly in the 5% range. This transaction was fairly complicated to underwrite given its age, prior use and ownership structure, and we believe it will be a fair comp for these types of assets. The common theme among each of these transactions is that data centers continue to become more widely accepted as a mainstream asset class and a liquid private market is developing for these properties.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski to shed some light on the demand curve and growth prospects data center investors are currently underwriting.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Thank you, Scott. As shown on Page 4 of our presentation, we signed leases totaling nearly $47 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $12 million direct lease with a former subtenant of a Powered Base Building in Santa Clara. The first quarter is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, and the fact that we were able to generate a third consecutive quarter of robust leasing velocity suggests that the business is gathering momentum.","We signed over $4 million of co-location revenue on the heels of a $7.7 million contribution in the fourth quarter of last year. And I am becoming increasingly optimistic that our mid-market segment should be able to deliver results within this range on a consistent basis. Cloud applications have been a major driver of our recent leasing activity, and the first quarter was no exception.","In addition, we also saw healthy demand from mobile, content and social media. We leased 5 megawatts of finished inventories during the quarter, but the ending balance was essentially unchanged from year end due to new inventory coming online and a Turn-Key tenant move-out in Los Angeles. We had another strong month in April, however, and have several committed deals that should enable us to make a further dent in our finished inventory balance during the second quarter.","The polar vortex did not have a pronounced effect on our operation, but we did have one large cloud requirement in Toronto that was touch-and-go to close by March 31 due to weather-related local government office closures. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow was able to stop the Digital sales team. And we closed that deal in the quarter. And I'm very proud of what the entire team has been able to accomplish together.","As you can see from the numbers at the bottom of Page 5, base rates for Turn-Key Flex leases signed were higher than they have been for some time. We do see pricing as generally stable to slightly improving, but the big number in the first quarter was primarily a function of market mix, reflecting higher rates at Asia Pac, which represented fully 30% of our leasing activity this quarter.","The chart on Page 6 is likewise indicative of stable to slightly improving pricing. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive, albeit just fairly, for Turn-Key as well as PBB, and GAAP re-leasing spreads were up by double digits across the board.","In addition to signings, lease commencements were also quite healthy. And as you can see from the chart at the bottom right of Page 7, the weighted average GAAP between signing and commencement remains reasonable at just over 6 months.","I'd like to pause here to highlight 2 data points related to the desired behavior incentivized by the new sales compensation program we rolled out at the start of this year. First, the book-to-bill cycle has stabilized at 6 months, with over 90% of the deals we've signed so far this fiscal year commencing within 12 months. Second, we have already seen market reduction in tenant improvement allowances, as well as rent grants and abatements, without any increase in comparable commissions. Now one quarter does not a trend make, but early indications are encouraging that the revamped sales compensation plan is already beginning to have its intended effect.","Moving on to Page 8. The key takeaway here is that the big blue bar called 4Q '14 contractual NOI is up by over $20 million since just last quarter, entirely due to leases signed in the first 90 days of the year. At a cap rate with a 7% handle, that represents around $2 per share of NAV.","Turning now to supply. The biggest change in the last 90 days is that all 24 megawatts of the shadow sublease space in Northern Virginia has been confirmed as available, up from 13 megawatts reflected on this chart last quarter. They have a very healthy demand funnel in Northern Virginia and very limited exposure. But the large block of sublease space, in addition to several recently announced competitive starts, could potentially pressure pricing in this market.","We believe our solutions should be somewhat insulated, hence, most of the available inventory is shared infrastructure product in contrast to our dedicated infrastructure offering. But we will be keeping a watchful eye on the supply-and-demand dynamics in Ashburn. I should point out that we do have a large lease in Northern Virginia with a financial services tenant that was signed at peak rent and is expected to roll down in the second quarter, which will clearly have an impact on our leasings, but has been fully baked into our guidance.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier, to take us through the rest of the variables affecting our financial results. Matt?","Matt Mercier","Thank you, Matt. We had quite an active start to the year on the capital-raising front. During the first quarter, we tapped the preferred equity market for the first time in almost a year. The issuance was met with solid demand and we were able to upsize the offerings and ultimately raise gross proceeds of $365 million. We were also able to price at 7 3\/8%, well below the range we had guided to previously. We also executed our second sterling bond offering, which closed in early April, raising gross proceeds of $500 million, 9.5-year paper at 4.75%, at the bottom end of the pricing range in our prior guidance.","Interest rate environment remains benign for the time being, and we are pleased to have turned out the substantial majority of our short-term floating rate exposure at what we perceive to be very favorable economics. Matching with the redemption of our exchangeable debentures, $261 million of the debentures were exchanged to common equity mid-April, which had the effect of reducing debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3 turns.","Credit metrics, shown here on Page 11, are pro forma for the following: first, the redemption and exchange of the exchangeable debentures; second, the sterling bond offering; third, asset sale that Scott mentioned; finally, the additional $65 million of preferred equity we raised under the reopening partial exercise with the greenshoe on the Series H, all of which closed subsequent to the end of the quarter.","You can see here, pro forma for those adjustments, net debt to adjusted EBITDA dropped 5x. Fixed charge coverage remains above 3x. With annualized adjusted EBITDA of over $900 million, we have more than $450 million of borrowing capacity while maintaining leverage below 5.5x. We do not expect to raise common equity on this year's remaining capital [indiscernible]. Asset sales may also be a potential source of capital.","Our guidance contemplates an additional dollar-denominated debt issuance, which could be either a dollar bond offering or a term loan. However, the timing has likely been pushed back from mid-year towards the year end, given the larger-than-expected preferred equity offerings, as well as the prospects of potential proceeds from asset sales.","Turning now to earnings. We reported first quarter core FFO per share of $1.28, or $0.10 above consensus. Roughly half of the analyst estimates and consensus appeared to reflect the severance charge for a former CEO and the other half do not. On an apples-to-apples basis, core FFO per share would likely have been $0.05 above consensus. As Bill indicated on our last earnings call, the timing and execution of our financing activities, as well as the incremental revenue expected from speculative leasing represented the primary wildcard in our 2014 forecast.","We are pleased to report we have made considerable progress on both fronts, having raised $865 million of capital previously discussed, and having reduced volumes of speculative leasings contemplated in our guidance by 50%. As a result, we have raised core FFO per share guidance to $4.80 to $4.90 a share. Solid leasing activity to date has largely derisked the low end of the range, but potential future asset sales and joint ventures represent additional wildcards.","But I'd also like to point out a few items to begin to bridge your own forecasts from our 1Q annualized core FFO per share to the 2Q through 4Q quarterly run rate applied at the midpoint of our range. First, as shown on Page 12, 5.9% blended coupons on the $865 million long-term capital we raised year-to-date is almost exactly 425 basis points higher than the all-in cost of our line of credit. 425 basis points on $865 million equals $37 million, or just about $0.07 a share per quarter, as shown on the chart. Second, joint venture contributions, the asset sale and the effect of 1Q expirations will be dilutive to the tune of $0.02 per quarter. Finally, operating expenses and overhead are both expected to pick up over the course of the year, which will reduce the run rate by another $0.01 per quarter. The upshot is that the core quarterly run rate is roughly $1.18 to $1.19 per share, essentially in line with the midpoint of the revised core FFO per share guidance range of $4.80 to $4.90 we've provided in the press release.","Shifting gears to operational performance. Our tenant retention was uncharacteristically low this quarter due primarily to a PBB move-out in Minneapolis, and occupancy slipped again as a result. However, we expect occupancy to begin to improve going forward. I would like to highlight 2 new variables with the assumptions underlying guidance that speak to our view of internal growth prospects going forward. The first is we are projecting portfolio occupancy at year end of 92% to 93%. Second, same-capital cash NOI growth of 4% to 5%.","This concludes today's prepared remarks. I would like -- I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator. We are pleased to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Toti of Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","My first question has to do with -- obviously, you touched on the retention rate and the occupancy as being connected. A question I have relative to the leasing statistics was across the board on both new and renewal leases, the terms or the lease length appear to be significantly shorter. Can you give us a little bit of background on maybe the composition that drove the shorter terms?","Arthur William Stein","So we think that we are living in an improving fundamental environment. So we're actually quite comfortable living with shorter lease terms. In the first quarter, we did have a number of leases with lower-than-average lease terms. But it really varies. So the current pipeline has leases that are also quite a bit longer than what you saw on the first quarter. And our mid-market initiative is designed to even out some of that lumpiness. I just want to remind you that the first quarter is our third consecutive quarter of strong leasing volume. And we saw very stable pricing in the quarter. And in addition, we saw very encouraging results from mid-market initiative, which as Matt said, we're expecting $4 million to $7 million a quarter of mid-market revenues. So to sum up, we think the first quarter demonstrates the continued strength of the overall demand environment.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Great. And then, my follow-up question, Bill, is just relative to your comment on increasingly looking at future joint ventures. Does the company have any outline as to the scope and the nature of those joint ventures? Or is it early days still?","Arthur William Stein","Well, it's still early days. We do have a potential joint venture on Turn-Key assets. We're evaluating that right now in the context of the larger capital recycling initiative. And we are looking at potentially using joint venture capital to fund our growth initiatives in Asia Pac.","Operator","Our next question is from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Terrific. So the press release refers to pricing being, I think, it said generally stable to slightly improving, and you mentioned the strength in Asia Pac. But if you could provide us more pricing color by region, including around the U.S., are there any particular standout markets, good or bad, right now?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. Thanks for the question. The pricing differential, and we did talk about sort of the standout piece and with the good deal of the Q1 leasing being in Asia Pac, and certainly is significant that the pricing in Asia Pac remains strong. We do see relatively stable pricing throughout the U.S. with some small pockets of potential increased pricing power in areas like New York metro, and I would say stabilized pricing power in the places where most of our new deals are landing, including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, for my follow-up, which is related, just regarding the supply by region that you provided back at the Investor Day. Are you prepared with any stats? Could you update on -- us on that in terms of excess supply? The number of quarters of supply by region? Or can you just give us a feel directionally for how much that's improved?","Matthew J. Miszewski","So certainly, I'd be happy to refer to some of the trends that we've seen in the first quarter, as well as sort of an update to where we are in -- from Investor Day. And I did make mention during my prepared remarks about Northern Virginia certainly as a standout area that has got some reported strength in terms of the supply that's out there. And I do want to make sure that we color this the correct way. The supply announcements that happened in Northern Virginia were primarily what we refer to as shared infrastructure supply as opposed to our dedicated infrastructure supply that we have in that same market. So the industry does need to mature to the point that it takes into account some of these product differentiations. But across the board, we certainly did see an increase in supply. As I just mentioned, in terms of pricing, we are not seeing the macroeconomic event that would suggest there would be pricing pressure in that market for us, as our pricing ability in Northern Virginia remains relatively strong. I believe, at Investor Day, we discussed a little bit about Silicon Valley supply as well. And all of these things need to be taken as a whole. Supply, of course, exists in Silicon Valley. And there were some announcements that would suggest additional supply. But we have seen, on our side, in my team, a demand curve that's actually shifting up and to the right. And so, that demand characteristic matches up with the supply that we currently have in that particular environment, which by the end of this half will be small to nonexistent.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. Yes. Just, first of all, it's another great quarter of leasing. And I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of either verticals or applications that you're seeing the demand come out of? And I guess, as a sub-question to that, just wondering how much of your leasing comes through an RFP process versus sort of an outgoing calling effort?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Happy to talk a little bit more about the leasing success and the vertical orientation, some of the leasing. We saw significant movement in terms of social media, the cloud being sort of a dominant part of the last 3 quarters of our progress, as well as some movement and some positive movements in terms of mobile applications, as well as content delivery. We believe that the progress in each of those areas in Q1 is indicative of the health of our ecosystem as we move forward. Each one of those has been identified as drivers of data center demand. But as we see us landing and capturing that demand, we think that bodes well for us.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And in terms of the RFPs?","Matthew J. Miszewski","So, yes, it's very interesting. I think we commented that 90% of our Q1 deals came from repeat customers of ours. And when we see repeat customers of ours, oftentimes, more than likely, we see those deals before they go out officially to RFP. So we see a good mixture of RFP-related demand, but we also, because of the relationships and the long-term relationships that we've had with our customers and the performance of our operational staff, we actually have a tendency to get some first looks prior to RFPs being released, then we have the ability to capture that demand pretty well.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. I don't know if I'm going to break some rules here, but I was wondering if you guys might tell us a little bit about how you're interconnected data center effort is going. And what kind of demand you saw for the bandwidth between your facilities?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. As you know, we are a big advocate of the digital ecosystem and that was -- the respect that I had for that process was based upon the promise of the digital ecosystem. During the first quarter, I got to see -- I was lucky enough to see the promise of that ecosystem now start to deliver itself in terms of actual results. And so -- and this was maybe a little less obvious in the prepared remarks that we had earlier. But we do believe that there's a shift happening in the data center market that used to focus on data storage as the highest-placed value, and now really focuses on the exchange of information as part of that value. When we started the digital ecosystem -- network ecosystem process, we had done it as a way to increase deal liquidity and to increase the size of those deals as they come out. We did see in Q1 some direct revenues that actually came out of that effort as well. So we're pretty happy to see the outcome be both direct and indirect to our bottom line.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Croson in Barclays.","Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Charles, standing in for Ross. So in terms of this retail push and taking that into context with the shifting to a more build-to-suit model, how does that work? Because I imagine that you're not building out an entire data center anymore for a few retail-based tenants. Can you kind of tease out how that all works?","Arthur William Stein","So the buy-to-order, if you will, is really more targeted at the enterprise market. And the middle market would still require that inventory be available. So that tends to be absorbed very quickly after signing.","Charles Croson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And, Bill, I apologize if you had mentioned this at the start of the call. I got on a little late. Do you have any updates in terms of the CEO search in terms of timeline, a potential short list of candidates?","Arthur William Stein","Sure. Well, the update is that the search has started. So a recruiting firm has been retained and the expectation is that the process will be concluded some time in 2014. But in the meantime, the board and the Chairman of the Board, in particular, has indicated that he's confident with the current leadership that's in place. And the board is really focused on finding the right candidate versus rushing to find the candidate in an arbitrary period of time.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Douglas of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Bill, maybe a follow-up on the last question. For the CEO search process, I mean, can you maybe talk about what criteria, if any, have been identified for that \"right candidate?\" And then, second question, maybe one for Scott. Just wondering if you can comment on where your visibility is on some of the asset sales as part of the capital recycling program. And maybe, what the potential magnitude of that could be this year?","Arthur William Stein","Stephen, the criteria is really what you would expect for the CEO of any public company, and particularly one that's in the data center space. So it's an individual that is experienced in data centers, ideally, specifically, real estate, as a subset, technology and finance. But let me -- I want to reiterate here though that the company is really focused right now on pursuing its strategic vision during this interim period. And that represents optimizing our return on portfolio, recycling our capital, as Scott will speak to, and unleashing the intellectual capital of the organization.","Scott E. Peterson","Part of the visibility on the asset sales, it's a little early in the process to speak to specifics on that. So we probably will have a better idea of some of the order of magnitude maybe in the next call. The general plan, though, is that we will sell the non-data center assets, the non-core markets, underperforming assets and evaluate the potential underperforming assets. And as Bill stated earlier, we'd expect to cull the bottom 5% to 10% of our portfolio over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the comments regarding sort of the more customer-centric focus today, which I think is definitely the right direction. In the past, the focus has been more on sort of standardization of processes and some of the scale benefits through the development program when you were -- was a bigger part of the story. I was just curious how you guys balance the benefits of that scale and standardization versus sort of more customized -- custom service-oriented solutions and maybe possibly more customized data centers.","Arthur William Stein","Sure, Vincent. So we think that it's possible to do both. So we basically build in blocks or modules. I think you've probably seen our presentations where you see how we build electrical rooms in Dallas, and it's been trucked up to our data center sites. So really, I think the issue is the level of redundancy that a particular customer might need. And we can adjust that through the assembly process, still maintain the cost efficiencies that we've achieved.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a follow-on to that question. I mean, as the industry continues to evolve and change, you guys talked about the supply in Northern Virginia being mostly shared infrastructure versus dedicated. I mean, are you seeing that sentiment change at all in terms of is there -- is the pool of folks that really just want dedicated versus shared as big as it has ever been? Or are you starting to see some of that barrier come down as people get more comfortable with the overall outsourced model?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes, that's a great question. And I would say that I certainly came in as a newcomer to the industry this last year with some of those same types of questions. I'd say that the past 3 quarters of very solid, dedicated infrastructure revenue that we produced is a pretty good testament to a strong and growing market out there for that particular type of product. But as Bill said, we can't keep our eyes closed to particularly new customer demands that are out there. We need to be open to that. And I think that the secret sauce moving forward is truly sort of getting the pieces that we have traditionally provided, that our customers have paid us for over the years. And coupling that together with what some of our partners provide to provide solutions that they're seeking in a new environment. And when we can do that, we find that the value that they're seeking matches well the value that we provide. And that's what we're going to try to do moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Bill, in order to avoid maybe a surprise next quarter, you already alluded to a lease with a financial services tenant that was going to roll down. Maybe, you could give us the magnitude of that roll-down. And how many more such leases that would be material we might see over the next year or so?","Arthur William Stein","Sure. Firstly, I want to emphasize, Bill, that rolldown is in our guidance. So there shouldn't be any surprise from that standpoint. And the -- we expect that rents could roll down in the 15% to 20% range for that lease.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Anything more over the course of the year that you think is going to pop up of that magnitude?","Arthur William Stein","No.","Operator","Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. I just have 2 questions. The first one being the 4% same-store cash NOI growth that you're projecting for the year. I'm just -- if you give a little bit more color on how you roll up to that number, because your occupancy, you're going to gain somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points. The mark-to-markets are probably going to be flat to modestly positive. I'm just kind of struggling a little bit how to kind of roll on that up to a 4% kind of same-store cash NOI growth number.","Matt Mercier","Yes, Tayo, this is Matt. Good question. So we've got 2.5% to 3% basically coming from -- we're talking about cash NOI growth. So we got 2.5% to 3% coming from just embedded rent bumps. And we've got probably 60 to 80 basis points from some of the expirations that we've talked about. And then, we also have another 2.5% to 3% coming from free rents of ramps that are burning off from the embedded portfolio, as well with some additional staggered lease commencements that were part of leasing we've done over the last year.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. That is helpful. And then, the second question is, one of your peers mentioned that they were actively working through the Facebook sublease in Santa Clara. Just kind of wondering, at this point, if you guys are doing anything with Facebook and where kind of things stand?","Arthur William Stein","Scott?","Scott E. Peterson","We don't make comments about individual customers, but we've enjoyed a great deal of success with Facebook, both as it started out a company and grew inside Digital's data centers. And we continue to see that progress moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I think you may have addressed this earlier, but the decline in guidance for spec revenue for this year that's just -- is that related to a longer-than-expected commencement lag?","Matt Mercier","No. I mean, this is a positive thing. It's actually -- the spec revenue we've cut in half. So meaning, we've signed up and expect to commence $15 million to $20 million of what we had in the prior quarter. So that leaves a -- or $10 million to $15 million, I'm sorry. And now, we have another $10 million to $15 million left for the year. But it's a positive.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","It's not a cumulative number?","Matt Mercier","It's not a cumulative number.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I was a little bit confused on that. Okay. But that helps. And then, I guess, a question for Bill or Scott, just on the guidance on cap rates. I guess, your max contribution could be $400 million, if I read that correctly. And your average cap rate that you're projecting is about a 7%, and I seem to recall that you guys have said that Turn-Key would be a big component of that, or potentially a meaningful component. And so, I'm just curious if that's the right inference that you guys think that a JV partner is going to pay basically a 7% cap for Turn-Key. And if that's not really much of a spread in cap rate over Powered Base, I'm just wondering if you can help us with the right conclusions to draw from what we're seeing in your guidance?","Arthur William Stein","Yes. I think that is a fair inference. And by the way, I want to go back to your question on leasing. The guidance was cut in half because of the leasing we did, not because we don't think we're going to do anymore leasing. I just want to make that clear. But we do think that -- I mean, I think, your analysis is correct that the 7-ish is probably the accurate cap rate to use on the Turn-Key for joint ventures. Scott, do you have anything you want to add?","Scott E. Peterson","I think that's probably it. Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First, I wanted to take a stab at the run rate that you ran through, Matt, on the guidance, starting out at $1.28, and then walking us down to $1.18 to $1.19. I guess what I didn't hear in there was any incremental contribution from the core growth that you're anticipating, as well as the impact of any new leasing in the speculative revenue. And I was wondering if there are offsets to those drivers.","Matt Mercier","Yes. Well, clearly, we have a backlog of NOIs we've shown. But the run rate's meant to project where we expect to be starting as of the second quarter. I think there's a couple of other things to keep in mind. First, as we've shown, we did have dispositions, but that's bringing down the run rate. And in addition, we have contemplated an additional capital raise in the year. So that provides some additional headwind that we could be facing, as well as our development program runs down. I think we've talked about in the past that there's capitalized interest that will be coming down. So again, this is just meant to project where we'll be starting as we enter the second quarter.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Just a follow-up, I think, Matt Miszewski, you mentioned in your commentary that the inventory remained relatively flat sequentially, as you brought on a little bit more inventory and you had a move-out in LA of a Turn-Key customer. So if you could -- so one, I'm curious about the nature of the move-out. But separately, can you just speak to the amount of inventory you would like to have available ideally going forward?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So I don't think that -- to the question, I don't -- we always sort of bandy about the conversation about what the optimal amount of ready inventory is. But given Bill's comments about the just-in-time inventory adjustment that we're going to make, given that we can deliver within [indiscernible], it becomes a little less of a pressing issue for us. We simply don't see the need for us to hold on to a significant amount of inventory because we're able to satisfy the customer's needs relatively quickly. And I think I may have talked about this at Investor Day, as well. So you may want to refer back to that. The move-out is an interesting story. It was about a 300-kilowatt move-out. And in order for us to do that -- really the organization that did that was consolidating their operations, and they did that out [ph].","Operator","Our next question is from Emmanuel Korchman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman, here, with Manny. So Bill, just had a question. As you think about when the board made the decision to make a change with Mike and let him go, you've titled this whole presentation in the supplemental, \"Turning A New Path Forward.\" I'm just curious, is this your new path forward that you've presented to the board? Or is Chairman of the Board and transition committee putting forth a new path forward?","Arthur William Stein","This is a new path forward that both I and the senior leadership team have created. And we presented it to the board, and we're presenting it to shareholders clearly, and we're going to be rolling it out to the employees as well.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so, how should we think about -- I assume, the board is thinking about a search process, both internal and external. And I'm not sure if you're raising your hand, or you have raised your hand. But I would assume, and if it is, if you're not the guy, and the new CEO comes in, they may have their own ideas about what path that they want to take, and their ideas about where they want to go. And isn't the board pigeonholing themselves a little bit? Or are you opening up investors to a secondary path forward when a new CEO comes into place, if you're not the person?","Arthur William Stein","Mike, well, I mean, I think these are pretty basic and fundamental in terms of a strategic vision. So optimizing a return on the portfolio, recycling capital, unleashing the intellectual capital of our workforce, is motherhood and apple pie? And I can't really see anyone else disagreeing with those initiatives.","Operator","Our next question is from Gabriel Hilmoe of UBS.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just going back to the spec revenue number for a minute, and what's been derisked so far. Are there any other moving parts in that number where you've added some additional spec relative to the $20 million to $30 million that you had in there before? Is that clearly here [ph], or has it truly been derisked, I guess, by 50%.","Matt Mercier","Can you repeat that? The first half was kind of lost.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, just on the spec revenue number, is it -- is the $20 million to $30 million, and I guess, now it's $10 million to $15 million, is that truly an apples-to-apples comparison? Or has anything been added on a go forward basis that's new spec revenue I guess?","Matt Mercier","I mean, that isn't apples-to-apples. I mean, just to be clear, it reflects what we expect to recognize from -- on a revenue basis from new leasing. It doesn't include re-leasing or renewal-type activity. So this is new incremental leasing. And at the start of the year, as we've noted, we had $20 million to $30 million expected from -- we expected to sign and commence from new leasing. And as a result of the strong first quarter results, we've cut that in half.","Gabriel Hilmoe - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I apologize if you mentioned this before, but how much of the leasing in the quarter was related to, I guess, the mid-market strategy? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that played out in the numbers?","Matthew J. Miszewski","I think, it's in there. But $4.1 million was related to colocation mid-market strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from George Auerbach of ISI Group.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Matt, you mentioned the pre-stabilized bucket has some assets moving in and out. Do you have a number for what the lease percentage would have been quarter-over-quarter had that bucket remained static?","Matt Mercier","I'm sorry, can you repeat that?","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. The pre-stabilized bucket, the $500 million of assets that's now 10% leased and was 17%. I know there's things moving in and out. Just trying to figure out what -- at year end, it was 17% leased, where would that have been today had you not sort of moved some assets in and out of that portfolio?","Matt Mercier","I don't have the ins and outs in front of me. I'm sure that's something we can follow up on.","Arthur William Stein","But, Steve (sic) [George], just to be clear, one of the reasons that percentage went down is that we took some properties out of that bucket that were signed and shown as leased last quarter, and were moved out because the lease has commenced. So that caused the percentage to -- percentage lease decline. And in addition, we delivered some new pods to the bucket as well. Those are pods at Melbourne and St. Louis. So in Phoenix, we commenced leases that have already been signed. They moved out of the bucket. We also -- I mentioned some leases in New York and, again, that bucket percentage will go down. But at the end of the day, this is going to represent our finished inventory. It has to be leased. So I think you would expect, but for properties that are signed but not commenced, that lease percentage should be relatively low until the lease has commenced.","George D. Auerbach - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. I guess I was just trying to think of some sort of measure, how you're doing leasing up that finished inventory? So I was just trying to figure out, as you went from Q4 into Q1, how much was done? And I guess, maybe, the question is, of the $500 million that's in the pipeline today, at 10% or 11% leased, on a same-store basis, where do you think that portfolio is on a lease percentage -- occupied percentage by year end '14?","Matthew J. Miszewski","So I don't know if I've got that exact number. But I think what you're going for, between Q4 and Q1, I'm always careful about the word I use, but we did burn about 5 megawatts of that inventory. And moving forward, we feel like we've got a target on burning even more of that inventory in Q2. I think that gets towards your question.","Matt Mercier","And just to follow-up. Most of that space is not in the pre -- is not going to be in the same capital pool. It's going to be in -- it's new space. And I think that I would refer you back to the 92% to 93% overall total portfolio occupancy that we're guiding to. We're at 92.1% to date. So clearly, that suggests that we expect to lease a decent amount of that pool in the remainder of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I was interested in the comments about one-size-fits-all. And I don't know if you answered it earlier or not. But you talked about, Bill, all Model Ts and being black, and so forth. And are you -- is there something different in terms of the technical specifications or parameters of the product around density or size that you were alluding to that's going to be different going forward? And then, my second question is, if you could speak to kind of the European market, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and so forth, and where you're seeing strength? And what kind of a competitive environment it is?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So great question about the product development that may be needed as we continue our customer focus moving forward. And you get right to the heart of what this senior leadership team over the past few weeks had struggled with and come to some conclusions about. We don't believe that there is a significant departure in terms of density and size, and what I call the building blocks of the solutions that our customers are seeking. The building blocks from our perspective will remain, space and power that we have delivered over time. They will also leverage our digital ecosystem in terms of the network deployments that we have made and that we have been able to leverage from some of our partners. And then, they will take some pieces from our partner ecosystem in the new Digital partner network, including items like managed services, cloud service provision, and the like, and they will be coupled together into solutions that our customers want. So in terms of what we need to provide from Digital's perspective, it remains in our wheelhouse. The density and size doesn't even change a whole lot. There may be a few things that we need to provide an individual market that maybe a little more dense or a little less dense, or a little larger, a little smaller. But the general facilities that we provide will continue to be the facilities we'll provide in the future for our customers. But the solutions will be different and will be tailored to their needs.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan -- a follow-up from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Reading a lot about data centers being built with no resiliency, no redundancies, so I guess, N, and obviously, the cost structure around that is a lot less. You guys have flexibility in terms of the redundancy that you can deliver to your customers. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any demand around that.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So great question, Jonathan. We see a lot of demand. And it really, from a resiliency perspective, plays the gamut. But the greatness of sort of our POD 3.0 architecture is we can deliver the components that our customers are asking for within the same time frame from market-to-market. So we had an example in 2013, where someone did come to us with a solid N requirement and we were able to deploy a data center solution whose cost profile met their price profile and met exactly what they were looking for in terms of resiliency. So I think that if there is anything changing, folks are moving more towards our incremental process so that they can actually address differing needs without addressing -- without significantly augmenting the cost to deploy.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session and conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John J. Stewart - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great, Thank you, Denise. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein; and Chief Financial Officer, Andy Power. Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson; Chief Operating Officer, Jarrett Appleby; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski are also on the call and will be available for Q&A.","Management may make forward-looking statements related to future financial and other results, including 2015 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to our business see our 2014 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. This call will contain non-GAAP financial information. Explanations and reconciliations to net income are included in the supplement package furnished to the SEC and available on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. So let's begin on page two of our presentation by recapping the guidepost for our strategic plan that we laid out, Investor Day in Ashburn just a few weeks ago.","Number one is achieving superior returns. We've always taken an investment management approach to our business and we remain focused on achieving the highest possible risk-adjusted returns at the asset level. This is entirely consistent with our emphasis on driving improved return on invested capital. And I'm pleased to report that we picked up another 10 basis points during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points. That's a remarkable achievement for a portfolio of our size.","Next is capital allocation. We believe that we've established a respectable capital allocation track record and we plan to build on that success. In contrast to the past 18 months, we expect to be committing capital to expand over the intermediate term. We intend to expand on our existing campuses, expand in existing markets, and grow opportunistically in new markets all subject to the caveat that prospective investments must be accretive to our shareholders.","We also intend to expand our product offerings. We are adapting our data center design to offer our customers a more agile solution. And Telx enables us to significantly enhance our colocation and interconnection offerings.","Finally, operating efficiencies. We are keenly focused on running this business as efficiently as possible. This includes emphasizing investment on our campus environments where we can achieve significant economies of scale. We are also focused on process improvement and leveraging technology to streamline day-to-day functions. As we identify opportunities, we expect to realize significant benefits from these initiatives over the next several years.","Let's turn the page to Telx. I'll begin by giving you a brief update on integration. Matt Mercier, who many of you know, led the first phase of our integration efforts through the closing of the transaction. Matt and his team led our efforts to formalize the combined organizational structure, define key business risks and objectives, identify bottom-up expense synergies while ensuring we maintain sales velocity and operational integrity, and he's done a great job for us.","For that matter, the entire finance and accounting and investment teams did a great job, successfully raising almost $2 billion of capital in three separate transactions, along with underwriting and closing the transaction.","The next phase of our integration efforts will be led by Chief Information Officer, Michael Henry. Michael has worked on many large acquisitions, most recently at Ericsson. His program is designed to ensure that we deliver the value we expect from the Telx acquisition, including product rationalization, go-to-market alignment and the overall customer experience.","I should also add that we recently brought on an interim Head of HR, whose organizational leadership experience includes helping to guide American Airlines through its $11 billion merger with US Airways. I think it's safe to say that we will benefit from Cindy's perspective during this transformational event for our company.","As you may recall, we've identified $15 million of expected cost synergies and we expect substantially all of these synergies to be realized in 2016. I know that you're all eager to see guidance including Telx and to learn more about the potential revenue synergies and how soon we can roll Telx out across our global campus network. In our view, it's far more important to get this right than to get it right now.","With that said, let me outline our priorities for you in broad brushstrokes. The first order of business will be leasing up the existing vacancy within the Telx portfolio. It may not be sexy, but it drops straight to the bottom line. The next opportunity will be to turn over to Telx the pockets of inventory within our gateway buildings where they already operate. This includes space like the property management office that we previously kept at 111 8th Avenue. The next step will be to have Telx take over our existing colocation business, notably including properties like 365 Main in San Francisco, which we believe Telx will be able to operate very effectively.","Next, we will turn to our domestic campus environments and look to build out a colocation and interconnection product offering on those campuses, notably including Ashburn, Dallas and Chicago. International expansion will be the final phase. Planning for each of these initiatives is already underway, although revenue synergies are likely to be realized beyond 2016.","Moving on to capital recycling. We don't have much to report beyond what Scott covered at our Investor Day three weeks ago. As he said, we have seven properties on the market, shown here on page four. We expect to receive upwards of $150 million in proceeds from these properties and we expect our capital recycling program to be substantially complete by the time we report fourth quarter results. We will remain patient, however, and we will continue to close when our value-added efforts and market conditions enable us to achieve the best execution for our shareholders.","Moving on to market fundamentals. As you can see here on page five, our recent leasing activity has been concentrated in our campus markets and with our target verticals, namely social, mobile, big data, cloud and content along with financial and IT services. In addition, strategically expanding our Global Alliance program is a top priority as we invest significant resources to develop a program of world-class partners who help our clients deploy their mission-critical IT workloads and Digital Realty facilities.","We are pleased to announce that during the third quarter, ClearSky Data and CompuCom became Global Alliance Partners joining our existing Technology Alliance Partners Program, including AWS, NaviSite, Rackspace, SoftLayer, Unitas Global and VMware.","On a panel at a recent investor conference, I made the observation that data center demand is stronger today than it's ever been in our 11-year history as a public company. I think you've seen that momentum reflected in the recent leasing activity reported by our publicly traded data center peers and you may have also seen that we essentially hit the high end of the range for our upwardly revised speculative leasing target for the full year.","Here's an interesting data point to demonstrate what I mean. Within the past five weeks, we have ordered 23 generators and have allocated 15 to projects scheduled for delivery over the next six months. Throughout the course of 2015 we've allocated between three to eight per month, so this represents a dramatic uptick in our level of delivery.","Along similar lines, I am very pleased to report that earlier this week we went hard on the acquisition of a land parcel in Ashburn in close proximity to our existing campus. This is one of the few remaining Greenfield sites suitable for data center development in Loudoun County. It will support the development of approximately 2 million square feet in the build-out of roughly 150 megawatts and will facilitate our customers' growth for the next several years upon completion of our existing Ashburn campus.","Turning to supply on page six. The big picture conclusion here is that most markets remain roughly in equilibrium and continue to gradually tighten. New supply in Northern Virginia ticked up during the third quarter, but we remain very comfortable with the leasing velocity in that market. We continue to closely match our new starts with customer demand and we continue to enjoy great success at healthy returns in Northern Virginia. Sublease availability in Silicon Valley continued to contract during the third quarter. Our view is that Silicon Valley has tightened considerably, consistent with third-party market commentary.","Finally, let's turn to the macro environment on page seven. Global economic growth has clearly decelerated over the past 90 days and monetary policy remains very accommodative. In addition, much has been written recently about a potential slowdown in the tech sector. From where we sit, however, the rumors of the tech-wreck coming back to the future have been greatly exaggerated.","For starters, cloud businesses appear to be some of the fastest-growing segments within the established, publicly-traded tech companies. In terms of a slowdown in the IPO market, it is certainly not uncommon to see a disconnect between public and private real estate market pricing. REITs periodically traded wide premiums or discounts to the underlying value of their portfolios and it doesn't seem unreasonable for private market valuations for tech companies to occasionally decouple from public market pricing. Valuation aside, however, one key difference is between the years 2015 and 2000 is that companies driving the Bay Area economy today have very legitimate business models, are generating significant cash flow and the drivers of the digital economy landing in our portfolio generally have very solid balance sheets with lots of cash and little or no debt.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our own financial strength.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bill. As we pre-announced at our Investor Day, and as shown here on page nine, we signed new leases representing just under $33 million of annualized GAAP rent during the third quarter. Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for over 70% of our lease signings during the quarter. Existing customers represented over 85% of our third quarter leasing activity and we added 16 new logos in the quarter bringing the full year to a total of 51 new logos.","On page 10 you can see the weighted average lag between signings and commencement tick backup to 5.4 months during the quarter from the record low of 2.5 months in the second quarter. This was primarily due to limit a remaining finished inventory on the shelves. Going forward, you should expect to see this measure hover around the historical average of about six months.","Turning to page 11, cash releasing spreads were positive across property types for the third quarter. In-place rents on the lion's share of our leases are now below market although we do still have several remaining above market leases notably in Northern New Jersey and Phoenix and individual leases can be large enough to swing the mark-to-market into the red in any given quarter.","On balance, however, we believe we have reached an inflection point and we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by market rent growth along with the steady progress we have made cycling through peak finished lease expirations.","Turning to our financial results on page 12, we reported 3Q 2015 core FFO per share of $1.32, $0.05 ahead of consensus. The outperformance during the quarter was driven by a combination of a few items including a large property tax refund in the west region. This refund maybe one-time in nature, but it reflects the operational excellence of our proactive portfolio management approach. In addition, the current year contribution from speculative leasing was ahead of plan, foreign currency translation represented a bit less of a headwind than expected and we did get a slight benefit from delayed timing on asset sales.","I would also like to point out the continued improvement in AFFO per share growth, specifically the non-cash straight-line rent and FAS 141 adjustments, both continue to trend down and our recurring CapEx spend was also down significantly this quarter. The lower recurring CapEx during the quarter is partially explained by seasonality, but in general, these trends reflect the improved underwriting discipline we've instilled over the past year and a half as well as consistently improving data center market fundamentals.","Please note that the AFFO includes $11 million of Telx transaction costs. Excluding these transaction costs, AFFO would have been $1.10 per share and our payout ratio would have been below 80%. The bottom-line is the quality of earnings is improving and the growth in cash flow is accelerating.","In addition, FX continues to represent roughly a 300 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top-line to the bottom-line as shown on page 13.","As you may have seen from the press release, we are raising 2015 core FFO per share guidance by $0.05. The upwardly revised range represents roughly 4% growth at the midpoint on our as reported basis and approximately 7% on a constant currency basis. I should point out here that our bottom-line FFO per share forecast includes the expected contribution from Telx, whereas the individual substance underlying the guidance reflects standalone results for Digital Realty only.","Please keep in mind that the Telx transaction just closed in early October. We are comfortable raising guidance while absorbing Telx into our financial forecast. We expect to give formal 2016 guidance early next year, at which point we'll provide greater visibility on the impact of Telx on our combined operating performance metrics. In the meantime, I can confirm that we still expect Telx to be roughly 1% accretive to core FFO per share in 2016, and roughly 3% accretive to AFFO per share.","In terms of Digital Realty's third quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy declined 90 basis points to 93.9%. As we stated for the past several quarters, the occupancy drive during the quarter was anticipated and we do expect occupancy to bounce back and finish up slightly by the end of the year. The occupancy decline was due to a few known power-based building move-outs, which impacted our tenant retention during the quarter as well, but I'd like to take a moment to provide some additional color on these non-renewables.","In our experience, data center customers have a high propensity to renew unless their core business undergoes a material change and provided they've taken occupancy for their space. The two largest non-renewals during the quarter have both been targets of M&A activity and neither had occupied the space for years. In addition, a significant portion of the space that was technically not renewed has either been a re-lease to sub-tenants or is currently under LOI to be re-leased.","Also shown on page 13, same-capital cash NOI was up 2.2% in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, same-capital's cash NOI would have been up 4.5%. For the full year, we continue to expect organic growth to trend to the high end of our 2% to 4% guidance range on a constant currency basis, but towards the lower end of the range on an as reported basis.","I'm pleased to report that we are on the cusp of a happy ending to the Net Data Centers bankruptcy. As you may be aware, Net Data Centers completed sales of East Coast operations last week, clearing the path to emerge from bankruptcy. Net Data Centers has elected to assume all of their leases with us in downtown Los Angeles and El Segundo with no change to the in-place rents.","They've remained current with us on all post-petition obligations throughout bankruptcy, and the only amount outstanding is roughly $1 million of pre-petition rent, which we have fully reserved. We expect to collect on the pre-petition receivable and reversed the reserve during the fourth quarter, which should represent upside of approximately $0.01 per share.","We mentioned at our Investor Day that we had begun the process of recasting about $3 billion of global credit facilities. I'm pleased to report that we have over $4.9 billion of commitments to the credit facilities today, including more than $300 million of commitments for a new seven-year term loan. We expect to tighten pricing and lower the cap rate used to value our portfolio for calculating total leverage and unsecured leverage under the loan covenants.","As shown on page 14, we expect to extend the maturity for the line of credit and the five-year term loan out from 2018 to 2021, and the new seven-year term loan would be scheduled to mature in 2023. We anticipate closing these facilities early next year.","As you can see from the left hand side of the page, pro forma for the recast credit facilities, we have very modest debt maturities through 2019 with no more than $200 million coming due in any of the next four years. In 2020 and beyond, maturities should likewise be manageable with a well-laddered schedule.","I would also like to note that we reached a milestone during the third quarter, with $1 billion of annualized adjusted EBITDA. Leverage dipped below five times as of September 30th, although we have since issued additional debt to finance the closing of the Telx transaction. Nonetheless, we expect to end the year below our target leverage of 5.5 times with the balance sheet positioned for growth.","In summary, we just capped off another very busy, but very successful, quarter and we are focused on maintaining our current momentum through the end of this year and into 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be pleased to take your questions.","Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. My question is regarding production and general leasing. So volume, which you disclosed to us at the time of the Investor Day and we've obviously received over the past couple of quarters, has obviously reflected a little bit of a lighter inventory as you guys have aimed to lease it up and do more profitable deals. But I guess, as you're integrating Telx, and I know it's early days, I'm curious about what a realistic leasing or production number may look like on a go-forward basis relative to legacy Digital.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thanks for the question, Jordan. This is Matt Miszewski. So, we would anticipate \u2013 and we're in the midst of actually baking the sales plan numbers for 2016, but we would anticipate similar results to what we've seen on a quarterly basis for the core DLR facilities and product sets with a slight uptick depending upon which region we're talking about and then a slight uptick with regard to the combination with the Telx inventory that's out there.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. But you wouldn't yet venture a guess in terms of what sort of growth, either top-line or on a quarterly basis, we should anticipate from a...","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","No, I wouldn't expect that.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","I wouldn't hazard a guess. And we'll make those comments in the next quarterly results.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Jordan, the plan is to have an announcement shortly after the first of the year where we will lay out the guidance for next year. That will include the assumptions for Telx as well as Digital.","Operator","The next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I was hoping you could talk us through how you're contemplating positioning the existing mid-market or colocation business as you think about consolidating Telx. There's clearly a meaningful pricing difference in that area versus where Telx space is being sold. And I'm just curious, as you contemplate your go-to-market for next year, how that product is going to be positioned with customers.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Matthew. Actually, it's a fantastic combination of the resources that we have currently in place in terms of the mid-market attack that we've been under for the last few years. And if you think about the new product set, it's okay to think about it in the following way as we get these definitions out into the market. The Telx facilities that we have and the Telx products that we have really satisfy a very concrete set of defined products fitting into that 0 to 300 kilowatt range, and then they have specific service levels that are attached to them.","If you think about the mid-market approach, the sweet spot for the traditional mid-market team in Digital Realty has been between that 300 kilowatt space and 1 megawatt space for our clients. We're certainly in the middle of doing a branding exercise, but right now we've got a major product that we've had historically, called the Scale product, at about 1 megawatt and above. If you think about that 300 kilowatt to 1 megawatt space as a mini-scale as opposed \u2013 we're not finished with that particular product definition yet, but mini-scale or mini-wholesale, you'd be on the right track.","So we'll be able to take advantage of the mid-market team that we fielded for the last year and a half, as well as a traditional Scale team that I have and the Telx team will fit right perfectly inside of our portfolio.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then just one for Andy, if I may. Talking about the increase in the signed to commencement lag up around five months, and I guess the expectation that we kind of stay at that level. You had been talking about an improvement in that area driving improvement in the straight line rent, in the pass-through to AFFO. As we think about our model, should we expect any change in that area going forward from the higher commencement lag?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Matt. So we ground that stat down as low as probably possible from a business perspective at 2.5 months. And it's really a product \u2013 you usually have to have a finished data center to go from a sign to commencement in that timetable. I think the more natural spot for that is closer to six months. I think you're going to see our straight line rents are non-cash and 141 suffering right around where they are today.","I think the other more meaningful part of that is not giving ramps upon commencement, meaning customers take over 100% of their space the day they commence their lease versus staggered commencements which results in a straight line rent adjustment and a gap between the cash and the gap. And we're continuing to push that and that echoes back to the underwriting discipline that's been instilled here over 1.5 years. So I don't think that stat's going to be changed based on this time to commencement.","Operator","The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good evening. Hey, Bill recognizing that the ink isn't dry yet on the Telx deal and you've got another one to chop there, but interactions out there with other dance partner. Any thoughts on what you might do next?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","What we're going to do next is integrate Telx. And I just want to repeat what I said in the remarks, Bill. Our highest priority is to successfully integrate this $1.9 billion investment. And so the focus is for the next two months on achieving the operating synergies and then rolling out through 2016, the revenue synergies. As far as additional inorganic growth, the criteria is as we've always stated, or as we've stated at least for the last 18 months which is to say we want anything we do to be strategic and complementary, and to be financially accretive as well as prudently financed. Yes...","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I was going to say given the recovery in the stock price, the valuation there, does that change at all your thought process on uses of capital?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","No. It doesn't. I mean if you think about Digital's history, we've been an acquirer of real estate and a developer of real estate. This is really our first major acquisition of an operating platform and we want to make sure that we do this right.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. And just add to that Bill, Scott here. We do keep tabs on everything that's going on in the marketplace and we're abreast of everything. But we don't want to lose sight of what our target is right now and that's getting Telx integrated properly and growing it within our platform.","Operator","The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. You mentioned the plan to commit capital and grow in new markets. Could you comment on the need to build out the sales force in certain markets post the Telx acquisition? What's the rough magnitude that we're talking about there and what's the potential timing?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Vance. This is Jarrett. We are in the process of reviewing their full pipeline and the customer. They've a healthy funnel in place. We will ramp up some level of resource and some market caps we've identified. But I think it's in the magnitude of five to 10 people, and to continue to grow. And again, you traditionally see some level of folks churn in your sales organization. So, I don't see any significant sales investment. All the underwriting was really consistent with what we did as part of the acquisition and the diligence we did.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And Vance, across the whole sales force, we do expect to see some interesting dynamics where the efficiency of each one of the assets that we have on both of the sales teams would be able to enhanced by the mere existence of multiple products. So we're excited about that and that does deaden the need for us to hire additional staff.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great color and then for my follow-up. Could you bring is right up to date on dispositions. How many are under negotiation, how many under contract and then what's the timing for bringing them through to fruition?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. I think the disposition program will be largely done by the end of the year here. We currently have one under contract that's going to close soon and we're negotiating a contract for others right now and then we've got a couple others that we are working on, just some value-add better sales outcomes projects on and so we hope to make some good progress on that shortly.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. So, a quick question on Telx, and as you think about potentially growing that platform outside the U.S. into Europe, and I wondered your interest level in purchasing divested assets not platforms, but individual assets in case anything were to become available as a result of the pending merger going on over there between Equinix and Telecity. And then, on the different data center design that you talked about, if you could just sort of give us your updated thoughts on what the implications are on yields that you hope to achieve in cost to develop as a result of the new design? Thank you.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah sure. So the first part is European assets \u2013 individual assets that may come for sale. We've got a long consistent history of acquiring assets like that; certainly keeping our eyes open and see anything that may come about as a result of that pending merger. We also are looking at some select individual assets out there as well. You know obviously, we try to maintain all of our principles as it relates to that, whether it's with respect to individual assets. We want them to represent good value to our shareholders and they have to be assets that fit well within our existing platform or portfolio, but to that extent, we'll keep an eye on everything that becomes available there.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And Jonathan on part two in terms of the new design, I think there's two components. One, we did see an opportunity to really open up more opportunities. So the first thing was more agility to drive service levels and innovate the product. So in terms of the return profile, I think we're just looking that we'll cover more of the market, particularly in the M+1 design or the different SLAs associated with that product and the yield implications.","And it also gives us ability to serve and not strand power for denser power solutions for those verticals and social, mobile, analytic, cloud and content. But again, our goal is to provide that high value to our clients and sell at the market rate which is what we're really focused on is serving those clients at the market rates.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. As we start to factor Telx into our model, I was hoping you can give us an update on what Telx's third quarter revenue EBITDA were, so we can start to think about that correctly?","And then also, you did lower your, I guess, NAREIT-Defined definition of FFO. Obviously there're some puts and takes there from the Telx transaction, but I was wondering if you could just walk us through what happened there and how that should perhaps change as we go into 2016? Thanks.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey Colby, it's Andy here. So we literally closed the transaction October 9th, so we've gotten preliminary read-outs on the numbers, but obviously we haven't had our team go through and scrub all the financials and get to a comfort level and we want to tell the public markets where we're coming out. Preliminary view is that that they're on track from a revenue and EBITDA standpoint. Nothing is changing with our expectations for underwriting for 2016 or pacing. We did commence literally in conjunction with the closing, we commenced the execution of our synergy plan.","We had a handful of executives depart on that day. We entered into transitional agreements with a handful of executives throughout the end of the year roughly and we've commenced on the rest of the expense plan which is expected to be done with and deliver on those synergies before the end of the year. That leads me to your second question. NAREIT definition doesn't add back the transaction expenses. So we will have transaction expenses associated with Telx and including severance they'll run through the P&L in the fourth quarter.","Colby A. Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC","And do you expect those costs to be done as we go into the first quarter, or could there be a little bit of bleeding into the first quarter as you relate to those things as well?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I think most of them will be done in the fourth quarter, the large majority of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Hey Bill, just want to go back to your comment about the demand being as strong as you've ever seen it, you mentioned the generator example. But I was just curious your development CapEx guidance did come down relative to prior. Just curious if you could provide some commentary on what was driving that? And then I have a follow-up.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, that's basically timing, Vin. The generators are a leading indicator and we would fully expect that the CapEx guidance will increase next year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So...","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","This is Andy, just before you ask your second question. It's just a timing thing when you release shelves, when you spend the money to construct. So we basically release the shelf a little bit later, so the bulk of dollars are going to bleed into the next year versus this fiscal year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. By that, do you mean so if it was $750 million to $850 million before, if you have a similar level for next year, does that mean we'll be sort of in the $1 billion-ish range just to make up for some of the timing?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I think it'll be closer to the high end of what we've put out in Investor Day, plus or minus $50 million.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jon Petersen of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks. Actually just wanted to pick up on development spending for next year. Obviously, it sounds like you guys are going to be more aggressive in terms of committing capital to expand, but to do that, does that mean you're going to increase the amount of spec development in the pipeline?","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I don't think so. I mean we're signing a lot of leases right now for space that doesn't exist. So I think you're going to see a decent amount of pre-leasing percentage on everything that we develop next year.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Okay great. And then, just one point on guidance that I'm a little bit confused about. So in terms of the long-term debt issuance, you're still saying $500 million to $1 billion. I know you did $500 million in June and then another $950 million which I assume gets put in with Telx, not part of this guidance. I'm just trying to figure out between now and the end of the year. Are we still expecting another debt deal?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","So the table on page 10, all of the assumptions from the slightly positive renewals down to timing on the debt, are all standalone, do not include Telx at all. So you don't see $1.9 billion acquisition, you don't see the $250 million preferred, you don't see the $740 million of equity or nor the $950 million of bonds. We are factoring the impact of Telx in our end results here. So we really think we'll achieve this core FFO per share including Telx for two-and-a-half months in the results. But the financings do not include it. We've completed $500 million of debt this year with a green bond. We're still evaluating the potential Eurobond before the end of the year. Now there's only so many weeks to the end of the year, so that may roll into next year.","Operator","And the next question will come from Manny Korchman of Citi. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Andy, if I look at your \u2013 sort of combining two pieces, your revised guidance as well as the walk to consensus, the $0.05 beat, I would think that the FX would probably replicate itself again in the fourth quarter. So was just curious why the top end guidance is going up less than the $0.05 that you beat by in the quarter, especially with FX repeating again.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Manny, the reason it's not up higher is that we're factoring a couple of cents, maybe up to $0.05, of potential dilution from Telx for the fourth quarter. That's not for 2016. Remember, we literally closed on 9th. Our assumptions for Telx 2016 include synergies being executed. We're working through that plan, but those individuals are still on the books. We have not consolidated our office space and haven't achieved some of those expense synergies. And it does include some of the underwritten growth, so there is some dilution, a couple pennies from Telx that brings down that high end. Does that make sense?","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure. And then if I turn back to the commentary on commencement timing. Does that mean that you're going to have less take-up of the pre-stabilized space as you develop more new space and that's why you're going to six months? Or is it just that new space magnitude-wise is just so much bigger than the stabilized space or the pre-stabilized space that will be leasing?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","I hope we don't have less take-up of the pre-stabilized stuff. That stuff's already standing there, so it should be easier to attack from a leasing standpoint. And we're very focused on that in our sales discussions in our investment committee. I'm just saying that 2.5 months was a very low time from sign to commencement and feels like from looking at the business over longer time period when you don't have lots of standing finished inventory, six months is a closer amount to a regular time period.","I think Matt wants to jump in and give more color as well.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah, Manny, thanks for asking a question to Andy that made him give me a cursed look. Our focus on the pre-stabilized space remains intent and I would say laser-focused as we've been saying around the table. And the history of the folks in my organization are such that that pre-stabilized space has become a pretty profitable target for us, so we're going to keep focused on it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","(43:02) in the prepared remarks, but could you give us a sense \u2013 you know what is out there that might be over market that's still in the portfolio that might need to be marked down, maybe magnitude or just some sense as to that.","And then I'd like to circle back to a question I had asked last quarter and just sort of get an update. But you guys have the opportunity to host the big cloud platforms from a large footprint perspective, but also really drive connections within the campus environment to the enterprises, obviously something enhanced through Telx. But I'm just wondering in terms of seeing the demand for enterprise to cloud, cloud to enterprise, seeing that develop, if you have any update or perspective on where we are in the cycle. Thanks.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","So, Jonathan, I think your phone might have been on mute for the first second when you chatted, so maybe just make sure we answer your full question. On the mark-to-market piece, two examples are Northern New Jersey, where we obviously have a heavy concentration of financial services. A lot of activity that would happen on the backs of the financial crisis where there was a very tight supply market and we delivered and signed pretty great leases. And in that tight market, some of those leases have rolled down historically and there's onesie, twosies in that market to come.","Another example is in Phoenix, off the top of my head, where we bought a portfolio. And when we bought the portfolio at the time, it had an above-market lease. We underwrote that, we factored that into what we paid the seller of that portfolio. And there's a lease or two in that market from that portfolio acquisition that will come through in the next year or two and roll down.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","And, Jonathan, this is Matt. The answer to your question on big cloud platforms and driving connections, that's exactly the strategy that we've been looking at executing before the Telx acquisition, but the Telx acquisition just makes it that much more crisp.","We've been having conversations \u2013 Jarrett and I have been having conversations with most of our major customers and all of the major cloud providers in the space. And very specifically, we've started to see an interest on their side to not just land the large cloud compute loads in our facility, which we've become expert at, but also making sure that there's available colocation space right next to that at extremely low latency and providing some direct connect facilities so that they can connect securely as well as with low latency.","So we're seeing increased demand, not just for the large cloud workloads to continue to land in our space, but to have those enterprise clients land right next to them in colocation space. In fact, I'm proud to announce that just late last night we were able to land another major cloud provider in our Chicago facility and that conversations have begun on just that structure.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","And just to build on that, Jonathan, I think what's really unique I think the industry is out there a lot with these cloud on-ramps and providers who are really going after the enterprise are providing cloud or managed services. What makes us really unique and different is our focus on the foundation and partners for the Scale. And we're seeing larger enterprises deploy right next to the compute engines and directly connect. So that is very much a unique pattern which makes us very compatible with partners who are focusing on the enterprise side of the business.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Bill, if you could, you mentioned the last five week statistic where you've ordered significant number of generators. Could you expound on that a little bit?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","We've only ordered the generators, Jordan, because we have clear visibility into the demand, which is to say that Matt's team has been busy signing leases, a decent amount of which has occurred at the end of the quarter so it's October business rather than September business.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, okay. That's fair. But it sounds like essentially it's correlated or related to a spike in leasing activity.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Perfectly correlated.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, okay. And then we've danced around the mark-to-market a little bit. But do you have a sense for what the mark-to-market looks like for next year? I know Andy just laid out the Phoenix one that could expire or mature in the next year or two. But if you're looking at the portfolio for next year, does it look like a positive mark overall or is it flat? How should we think about that?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Jordan, so we're still going through budgets for next year to give you the most up-to-date data. We're looking at the numbers, it looks like it's around flat across the entire portfolio. We're trying to push it into the positive territory. But these one-off exceptions which have reasons to it, not due to anything other than being a site of preference (48:43) or something we underwrote that are driving the down piece of it. So you're going to get a full picture when we put out our guidance at the beginning of next year.","Operator","The next question will come from Will Clayton of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks for the question, guys. I was just wondering, as you work through the four-stage strategic priority list on Telx, how should we think about the timeline capital intensity profiles and margin impacts of these different stages? And what are the targets or metrics that we should use to kind of hold people accountable for executing on strategic objectives?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Will. This is Andy. So out of the gates what we said before and what we continue to plan to deliver is essentially $148 million of EBITDA from the 20 Telx locations; $15 million of expense synergies, $10 million of it roughly flowing to the P&L. We expect to meet or outperform at all those metrics. Capital intensity, recurring CapEx associated with that 2016 plan is 20%-ish of that EBITDA. There's a little bit more of expansion CapEx outside of that. But obviously the expansion CapEx will have a massive EBITDA contribution in 2016. Anything beyond that we view as a revenue synergy, which we're putting and doing a lot of work towards and continue to develop throughout 2016; and we think it will be a small contributor to 2016.","And those are the examples that we've outlined before and some of which on this call, be it bringing Telx to Ashburn domestically, expanding their presence in some of our Internet gateways, tethering in certain assets, or eventually bringing the Telx product of colocation or connection to our international campuses such as a Singapore or a London. But I would say that's a more \u2013 we'll be doing a whole lot of work on that in the next 12 months to 18 months. But I don't think you'll see a ton of capital intensity or a ton of EBITDA contribution during that time period.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah, Will. Scott here. To help you out a little on that, if you look at the different stages of the priorities, they go from an ease of execution, but if you also look at them they go from a higher initial gross margin business and a lower capital intensity. So I think you see the initial stages will have better impact than the more capital-intensive, longer lifecycle later stages. So that's a good way to think about it.","Will Clayton - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about what you are noticing in terms of industry fundamentals today. You seem to have sustained momentum in leasing volumes. But also on the pricing side, where do you see prices on new leases and renewals over the next four or five quarters? And then how do you think about that relative to current levels?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Will. In terms of the industry fundamentals, of course, it is, as a real estate business, region by region specific, but we see the industry fundamentals as strong and growing in certain accounts. If you go back to the slide where Bill highlighted our focus on the SMACC accounts and the SMACC portfolio, we continue to see an increasing amount of interest in our facilities from the social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content providers, which suggests that there is a great deal of strength in the industry that we're going after to address.","The second piece is, if you think about the shift that we talked about at Analyst Day and the conversations that we've had, if you look at the historic approach that we've had in going after enterprises directly and the shift to go after those enterprises indirectly, that gives us the ability to have lower cost of sale and take advantage of the core competencies we have to hit the high-growth, high-potential SMACC workloads.","In terms of pricing \u2013 and I am going to turn it over to Jarrett in a little bit \u2013 but in terms of pricing, I continue to see that the discipline that we're exerting in our piece of the industry and the rest of the discipline that the industry has with regard to supply is having a positive effect on pricing.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","And just with the contract vehicles and the pricing, what's really interesting is you sell frequently \u2013 in this quarter it was 85% of our sales came from existing customers. We are adding 1,000 new customers that we can now sell a full suite of products. So I think both sales organizations are very excited to sell colo, connectivity and Scale; and we have to take advantage of that with the assets that we have as a combined company.","Operator","And at this time, we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for his closing remarks.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Denise. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our third quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 16. First and foremost, we picked up another 10 basis points of improvement in our ROIC during the third quarter, bringing the total improvement since the fourth quarter of 2013 to 130 basis points.","I would also like to point out that the 10 basis point improvement during the third quarter excludes the one-time property tax refund; and the 130 basis points since year-end 2013 likewise excludes the impairment charge we booked during the fourth quarter of 2014. These items would've added another 10 basis points each to the total.","As you know, we recently closed on the acquisition of Telx, which we believe will be a truly transformational transaction for our company. We beat third quarter consensus estimates by $0.05 and we raised guidance for core FFO per share from the prior range of $5.05 to $5.15, up to $5.12 to $5.18. In short, we continue to execute on our top priorities.","I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who were responsible for delivering yet another solid quarter, many of whom have been working around the clock on the Telx acquisition and integration. That concludes our third quarter call. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation.

Good afternoon everyone. The speakers on today's call will be CEO, Bill Stein, Chief Investment Officer, Scott Peterson, SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski and Vice President of Finance Matt Mercier.","In addition to our press release and supplemental, we've also posted a presentation to the investor section of our website to accompany management's prepared remarks. You're welcome to download the presentation and follow along throughout the call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that management may make forward-looking statements on this call. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Such forward-looking statements include statements related to the Company's' future financial and other results, including 2015 guidance and the underlying assumptions.

Questions will be strictly limited to one plus a follow-up and if you have additional questions, please feel free to jump back into the queue. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Stein.","Bill Stein","Thank you, John. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us. We had a very good year in 2014 and I would like to begin today by providing a quick update on the steady progress we've made towards our 2014 strategic initiatives shown here on page 2 of our presentation. First and foremost, we made significant headway leasing up our existing inventory during the fourth quarter. The improved utilization of our existing asset base has contributed directly to a meaningful uptick in our return on invested capital, which is up 60 basis points over the last year. Given the size of our asset base, this is a remarkable turnaround.","Scott Peterson will provide greater detail on our capital recycling initiatives in his remarks, but we have completed our comprehensive portfolio review and have identified assets that no longer fit with our strategy or investment criteria.","As disclosed in our press release, we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter on three underperforming properties to write them down to their estimated fair market value at year end. As we stated last quarter, the bucket of non-core assets includes some winners and these three properties are clearly the losers. But on balance, we continue to expect to recognize gains at least on par with any impairment charges or losses.","We began marketing for sale the first few non-core assets late last year. During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of one small investment and subsequent to year-end, we closed on the sale of a non-data center building in suburban Boston. We have clear line of sight to reaching the low end of the range for our dispositions guidance and we remain pleased by the execution we're achieving on the sale of our non-core assets. The implementation of our capital recycling strategy is resulting in steady progress towards our objectives.","The global alliances program concluded a successful year in terms of adding demand to our sales team's funnel. The channel program alone added $3 million of mid-market opportunities in the latter part of the year.","In addition to expanding our global cloud marketplace to include a broader array of cloud service providers, we have also expanded our cloud connect product to include services from partners such as Zayo to enable our clients to immediately connect their hybrid cloud. We saw the first orders for this new product within weeks after rolling it out. We're also seeing demonstrable demand from our alliance partners to leverage their sales force against the Digital Realty product offering.","As you know, the enterprise segment is our bread and butter customer base and cloud service providers find our portfolio to be highly desirable in part because they want access to our enterprise customer base. But this attraction is mutual and our global footprint, our scale and our cost structure represent significant competitive advantages for landing the intersection of cloud and enterprise within our global portfolio.","Moving on to inventory management. We pulled in the reins considerably on speculative development in 2014. As mentioned, we've made good headway leasing up our finished inventory and as our stockpile has dwindled, the risk profile of our development pipeline has decreased.","As you can see from the development life cycle schedule on page 34 of our supplemental, our active data center construction projects are currently 83% pre-leased. Given our position of relative strength, we're comfortable today building out small increments of capacity without a signed lease in a handful of select markets where we have clear visibility on demand, primarily Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore.","Turning now to our human capital. As previously announced, Jim Smith and David Schermacher will switch roles effective March 1. This rotation provides an opportunity for the further development of both of these talented executives.","I also believe that the new roles will play to their respective strengths. I expect Jim Smith, whom many of you know, to excel in a more customer-facing role. Conversely, no one in the organization is better situated to understand our clients' evolving technical specifications than David Schermacher, the current head of our technical operations group.","Our traditional Turn-Key design has served us well, but there's no reason we can't endeavor to improve upon our existing product offering and potentially reach an even broader addressable market. Neither Jim nor David will be married to existing processes or cost structures and both will bring a fresh perspective to their new responsibilities. I'm incredibly optimistic that each will be able to unlock significant value for our shareholders.","Likewise, I'm pleased to announce that Krupal Raval, whom many of you also know, has been appointed to the post of Senior Vice President of Finance for the Asia-Pac region, effectively functioning as our regional CFO. He began his new role in Singapore on January 1 and has already begun to have a positive impact.","Finally, let's turn to the macro outlook laid out on page 3 of the presentation. Rough three fourths of our portfolio is concentrated in the U.S. and the domestic economy remains a relative bright spot on the global landscape.","Clearly, the drop in the price of oil and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar are the most significant macroeconomic developments since our last call. In short, while GDP growth is beneficial to IT spending, data center demand drivers are secular in nature and demand continues to significantly outpace GDP growth.","The positive net absorption we have registered within our portfolio has been mirrored at the sector supply level and landlord leasing economics are consistently improving. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott Peterson for an update on our capital recycling initiatives.","Scott Peterson","Thank you, Bill. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of a small investment we made a little less than two years ago in a developer of data centers in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. We invested approximately $17 million and the sale generated net proceeds of roughly $32 million. Given our comparatively short holding period, we generated an unlevered IRR just over 50% on this investment and recognized a $15 million gain on sale in the fourth quarter.","Since this was a gain on investment, rather than a gain on the sale of previously depreciated real estate, the gain is included in NAREIT defined FFO although we have backed it out in our presentation of core FFO. In the execution of our capital recycling program, our team has been focused on maximizing proceeds for shareholders. We've allocated two investment professionals who typically work on acquisitions to oversee this process.","On our third quarter earnings call, we announced that we had identified an initial pool of nine assets for disposition. Of these nine properties, one has been sold, two are in advanced contract negotiations, one property was 100% vacant when identified, but our team now has it fully leased and it will be marketed within the next few weeks. The remaining five properties are undergoing similar value-add efforts which we believe will result in better proceeds for our investors.","During the fourth quarter, we determined to bring an additional eight properties to market. Once our business plan changed from hold to sell, three of these properties no longer cleared the impairment accounting recoverability test and we took an impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write these three properties down to their estimated fair market value as of December 31. While conditions are always subject to change, we do not expect our capital recycling program to result in any additional impairment charges at this time.","Of these next eight properties, five will be brought to market in the coming quarter, two need some additional leasing and the final property will likely be sold to a user if they continue to pursue it. We closed on the sale of our first non-core asset, a non-data center property in suburban Boston, subsequent to year-end. We sold this property to a regional investor for $184 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. The sale generated net proceeds of approximately $29 million and we expect to recognize a $9 million gain in the first quarter.","We reported last quarter that leasing activity on non-core properties had picked up considerably over the preceding 90 days. I'm pleased to report that we were able to finalize signatures on several key leases during the fourth quarter.","You may have noted from our supplemental disclosure package that recurring capital expenditures were up significantly in the fourth quarter. This was almost entirely due to leasing costs on these -- on the two leases at two non-core, non-data center properties, one in the Mid-Atlantic and one in the Bay area.","These two leases represent approximately $4.5 million of annual NOI and the average lease term was over 10 years. This leasing activity should generate significantly greater proceeds for our shareholders from the sale of these two non-core properties. And now for a real-time update on data center leasing dynamics, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Miszewski.","Matt Miszewski","Thank you, Scott. As shown on page 4 of our presentation, we signed new leases totaling approximately $46 million of annualized GAAP rent during the fourth quarter. Mid-market revenue accounted for over 10% of our leasing activity and this marks the fifth consecutive quarter that our mid-market segment has delivered a consistent contribution of between $4 million and $8 million. This segment has had the intended effect of smoothing out some of the traditional lumpiness in our quarterly leasing activity and we're making steady progress towards our goal of doubling the size of this business from 4% to 8% of revenues within a three-year time frame.","Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content were the major drivers of our leasing activity throughout 2014 and the fourth quarter was no exception. These workloads accounted for nearly 75% of our fourth quarter lease signings. In addition, existing customers accounted for nearly 90% of our lease signings again in the fourth quarter, but we also added 21 new logos in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 100.","Turning now to page 5. Cash rents on renewal leases were positive on average with a slight roll-down on Turn-Key leasing offset by positive cash re-leasing spreads on power based building renewals.","The chart on page 6 puts our full year lease volume in perspective. And while Turn-Key rates shown here at the bottom of the chart can be skewed by geographic mix in any given quarter, the full year results clearly tell the tale of a market rent trough in 2013, followed by the beginning of a recovery in 2014.","In addition to leases signed, lease commencements were likewise healthy. In fact, 2014 was a record year for lease commencements. The weighted average lag between signing and commencement held steady at five and a half months and has settled consistently in the six month range for the past six quarters.","We leased a total of 20 megawatts during the fourth quarter, almost half of which was finished inventory. And we generated 9 megawatts of positive net absorption within the finished inventory pool during the fourth quarter. As you can see here on page 7, we have made steady progress towards our objective of leasing up existing inventory. Most notably, we shrank the finished inventory balance in Phoenix by 4 megawatts during the fourth quarter. We now have just 2 megawatts of inventory remaining in Phoenix, a dramatic reduction from 11 megawatts as of our Investor Day in November 2013.","At the portfolio level, we now have 23 megawatts of finished inventory remaining, down 45% since Investor Day. Going forward, it is entirely possible that the reduction in our stockpile of available inventory coupled with tighter lease underwriting discipline may impact leasing velocity in future periods. However, we remain confident that our focus on profitable growth is translating to improved net effective leasing economics and better returns for our shareholders.","Turning now to supply on page 8. You can see graphically here what we mean when we talk about the rationalization of supply in the data center industry. We have consolidated the third quarter supply snapshot on the same page as the fourth quarter, which visually highlights the sharp reduction in availability within the Northern Virginia market.","The absorption of sublease space in Northern Virginia has been well-documented, but sublease availability in Silicon Valley came down a bit during the fourth quarter as well. A portion of this was the block in our Santa Clara portfolio, which we alluded to on our second quarter call.","We successfully negotiated a lease termination fee from the existing Internet enterprise tenant and we were able to immediately re-lease the space to a cloud service provider. The existing lease was a power based building structure, but the space had been highly improved by the former tenant and we were able to re-lease it at Turn-Key rates.","We will have to invest some of our own capital, but we expect to generate a very attractive return for our shareholders on this transaction. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Matt Mercier to take you through our financial results.","Matt Mercier","Thank you, Matt. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Digital Realty celebrated its 10th anniversary as a public Company. So I'd like to start here on page 9 and take this opportunity to recap the track record we've established.","Over the last 10 years, DLR has generated annualized total returns of 22%. This is the single best performance in the REIT universe over this time frame and represents over 1400 basis points of annual outperformance relative to the RMS.","We have generated mid-teens compound annual growth in both dividends and FFO per share from 2005 to 2014. We have also generated positive growth in both dividends and FFO per share every single year.","As represented in the chart on the top left of page 10, Citi Investment Research recently published a report titled Don't Forget About Those Dividends and identified Digital Realty as having generated the second highest compound annual growth in dividends per share within the REIT industry over a seven and nine year period. Perhaps even more importantly, this growth has been achieved with a low volatility. We're one of only 10 REITs among the 140 constituents within the RMZ to have increased the dividend each and every year since 2005. This is a track record that we believe warrants a Blue Chip valuation rather than the discount by almost any measure as shown on page 11, at which we trade relative to the REIT universe.","Similarly, moving on to page 12, we believe our balance sheet stacks up favorably relative to a Blue Chip peer group. It's worth noting here that debt to EBITDA improved another 2\/10 of a turn in the fourth quarter to 4.8 times.","I would also like to point out a change to the balance sheet presentation as of December 31, 2014. Five assets have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet related to our disposition program as Scott discussed.","While we're in various stages of the disposition process on a broader group of assets, these five were the only ones to meet the requirement to be classified as held for sale as of year-end. The accounting treatment is to collapse the net book value of these assets and liabilities of the properties held for sale into their own lines on the balance sheet. Divestitures aside, our investment grade credit ratings are supported by the diversification of our customer base as well as our geographic footprint. As shown on page 13, our exposure to the current hot spots is manageable.","We do have exposure to net data centers, formerly known as Net2EZ. However, we believe their operation at our El Segundo data center less than two miles from their headquarter is significantly cash flow positive. In addition, Net2EZ represents less than 1% of our total revenue. We have judiciously avoided exposure to Bitcoin mining credit. So we do not expect to see any impact to our customer base or rent role from the drop in the price of Bitcoin. We view the energy sector as attractive in the long run and we have identified it as an underpenetrated target vertical.","Oil patch customers currently represent less than 2% of our total revenue stream. However, though we have limited exposure in the near term. Similarly, we like the Houston market in the long run, but there's little doubt that the regional economy will be negatively impacted from the drop in the price of oil. Our exposure is limited, with less than 1.5% of our portfolio concentrated in Houston. In terms of oil, the direct impact on our cost structure from a $10 swing in the price of a barrel of oil is considerably less than a penny per share.","Moving on to foreign currency. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, the U.S. represents roughly three fourths of our portfolio. We're exposed to non-U.S. dollar currencies on the remaining one fourth of our portfolio. We manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective.","In terms of reported earnings, however, we're exposed to currency translation swings, primarily in the pound and euro. We indicated in early January that foreign currency translation was expected to represent an earnings headwind of a little over 1% and the dollar has strengthened further since then, particularly against the Euro.","It is important to keep in mind that while having a global portfolio exposes us to currency risk, it also enables us to satisfy the international data center requirements of global enterprises and cloud providers, which is a key competitive advantage. We remain comfortable reiterating core FFO per share guidance within a range of $5 to $5.10. However, if the dollar continues to strengthen and if we prove unable to collect rent from Net2EZ for the remainder of the year, then we would likely be trending towards the low end of the range. It is also worth noting that we expect the quarterly distribution of core FFO to be back end weighted, with the split roughly 48 to 52 between the run rate in the first half and the latter half of the year.","Moving on to operating performance. Portfolio occupancy ticked up another 20 basis points sequentially to 93.2%, the third consecutive improvement in occupancy. We do have several known move-outs in 2015, however, primarily power based building expirations on the West Coast. And we expect portfolio occupancy to dip in the first quarter and again in the third, before bouncing back to finish up slightly by the end of the year.","Our leasing activity's off to a good start in 2015 and we have whittled the incremental revenue from speculative leasing embedded within our forecast down from $25 million to $30 million in early January to $20 million to $25 million as we speak. This progress is one of the primary variables that gives us comfort reiterating guidance despite the foreign currency headwinds.","I would now like to take a moment to highlight some of the further disclosure enhancements we've made this quarter, as detailed on page 14. First of all, we have broken out construction in progress and land held for development on the face of the balance sheet. Second, we have provided new net effective rent disclosure on the leasing activity pages in the supplemental.","Third, we have disclosed IT load by property for the first time in the supplemental. Although please be sure to note we have presented IT load only for Turn-Key and colocation data centers, not for power based building footprint.","Fourth, we have also slightly rearranged our joint venture schedule to make it easier to arrive at cash NOI. Fifth, per NAREIT's request, we have included FFO guidance under the NAREIT definition in addition to our measure of core FFO. And finally, beginning in 2015, we will present a more stringent classification of property level CapEx.","The puts and takes of our prospective CapEx reporting are laid out on page 15 of the presentation. The upshot is that we will strip out all property level capitalized expenditures from the enhancements and other non-recurring CapEx category, which will then be comprised solely of capital spending on our network fiber initiatives and software development costs, primarily our DCIM or data center infrastructure management solution. This category previously included approximately $25 million of capital spending that has been deemed to be either discretionary in nature or related to non-core properties and has been cut out of the budget all together.","Roughly $40 million consisted of infrequent expenditures for capitalized replacements and upgrades which for all intents and purposes amounts to property level spending that should be classified as recurring CapEx. Conversely, recurring CapEx previously included approximately $25 million of first generation leasing costs which should be classified as development spending.","Taking a step back, it's important to note that we're not making any changes in accounting policy. These costs have always been and will continue to be capitalized to the basis of their respective building. We're simply adopting a more conservative approach in terms of the categories of capital spending that we deduct from FFO to arrive at AFFO.","We hope that you find these disclosure enhancements to be helpful. We aim to continuously improve the transparency of our financial disclosures and as always we welcome additional input from analysts and investors. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Bill for closing remarks.","Bill Stein","Thank you, Matt. I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks by recapping our 2014 highlights as outlined here on page 16. We leased a total of 67 megawatts last year, including 28 megawatts of finished inventory and we reduced the finished inventory balance by 20 megawatts. We improved our return on invested capital by 60 basis points. That does not include the benefit of impairments, by the way, which boosts ROIC by another 10 basis points.","We reversed the declining occupancy trend and finished the year up 60 basis points on the heels of three consecutive quarterly upticks. Same capital cash NOI grew 4% and we reached $1 billion of NOI. We put up 7% growth in adjusted EBITDA, 6% growth in FFO and 4% growth in FFO -- in core FFO, despite terming out over $850 million of long-term capital and selling or contributing properties that generated over $20 million of NOI.","We further de-leverred the balance sheet and brought debt to EBITDA down from 5.4 times to 4.8 times. We closed out the year with a $0.03 beat in the first quarter and finally, we delivered a 41.6% total return to our shareholders, outperforming the REIT index by 1100 basis points.","In short, 2014 was a very good year in terms of consistent execution on the strategic initiatives that we laid out early last year. We have work yet to be done, however and we will continue to update you on these objectives. In addition, we will look forward to sharing with you our top priorities for 2015 on our first quarter call.","I would like to thank the incredibly talented team of Digital Realty employees around the world who are responsible for delivering the success we achieved in 2014. And now, we will be pleased to open up the call and take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Schildkraut","The results look pretty solid here and I thought the commentary about renewal pricing in the fourth quarter was very positive. I think it was up 6% on a cash basis. But when I take a look at your November deck and your expectations for GAAP and cash rent renewal rates for the full year, it seems like the full year numbers came in a little bit lighter than you were anticipating in November. I was wondering if you might walk us through some of the puts and takes as we look at that presentation versus what happened at the end of the year. Thanks.","Matt Mercier","We continue to see market rents improving long-term and all of that is driven really by a more rational supply level as we walked through in the deck in the introductory remarks. We've talked over last year and during the last presentation about some of our above market leases. The majority of those -- important to remember, the majority of those above market leases have now been resolved. We expect in 2015 that those renewals will roughly be flat.","It's important to remember and we want to make sure we talk about this, that some -- there are some above market lease exposure that we do have in 2016. But if you look back at FY14, it was down about 0.9% and in Q4 was up about 0.3%. So we expect that the market rent improvements over 2015 -- in 2015 will help to mitigate our exposure and that goes back to our belief that the fundamentals in the industry are truly improving.","Jonathan Schildkraut","And as a follow-up then, just to confirm, looking at your guidance from the beginning of January to now, in both cases you guys are talking about positive rent roles on a cash basis. So you continue to be somewhat positively disposed to spot rate pricing. Wondering if you've seen any change in the marketplace between then and now, about six weeks' time period. Thanks.","Matt Mercier","In terms of January to now, I don't think we've seen any fundamental changes. We continue to see the fundamentals improving and we expect a slight improvement over the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes. Related to that last point, I just wondered about spot pricing and on a like for like basis, are there any differing trends that you're seeing by region for similarly sized requirements, say six months ago, 12 months ago, versus right now? And then on the mid-market growth, I wondered how much of that growth that you quantified came from new logos.","Matt Mercier","We do see some regional performance dynamics, stability in Northern Virginia, moderate to or slight to moderate improvement in Chicago and in Dallas. And in Asia-Pac, we see strong cash indications that our investment in Asia-Pacific in particular in Singapore and Hong Kong continue to have an upward trend for us. We see that stability.","I think in my opening comments, I made some remarks about both the amount of revenue that we see from existing and repeat customers, seems to be relatively stable around 90% from quarterly -- in terms of quarterly performance. And then we did add 100 new logos last year, which we think is a good coupling of growth from our existing client base and then new logos coming primarily from our mid-market efforts.","Jonathan Atkin","Right. And then the tenant type, there's a pie chart at the bottom of page 13 of the presentation and I just wondered, is there any particular vertical or type of tenant that you would see yourselves indexing more towards in the future?","Matt Mercier","Yes. So we try to think about it in terms of workloads for us and in workloads I covered a little bit about smack workloads. I do get entertained by the guys around the table here today using the word smack, but it's social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content.","We continue to see a significant amount of additions from each of those workloads. We do have a vertical focus as well. When you talk about the areas where we're incredibly strong and dominant, financial services continues to be one of those great verticals for us, both across the large enterprise space but also starting to pop up a little bit more in the mid-market space as well.","And then traditionally our IT Telco and cloud verticals remain extremely strong. You did hear a little bit of a mention of oil and gas in the preparatory remarks and energy all up. We consider ourselves to be underpenetrated in that vertical, but some of the activities and macroeconomic effects that are happening right now will tend to tip some of those folks to think a little bit differently about their data center deployment. And we would certainly expect that they would look at a provider like us as a way to resolve some of those interests.","And then healthcare, I would consider an underpenetrated vertical for us as well. And in healthcare we've seen a significant uptick last year and that continues again in Q1 this year. One of the verticals, our intention is to go after more penetration through our partner activity is the public sector vertical, which I've got a personal interest in. We've got some fantastic partners including Carpathia that is just one of the partners that we intend to go to market through to help us over-penetrate that vertical.","Operator","The next question will come from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vance Edelson","Could you give us your views on the recent Telecity merger announcement in Europe and whether that has any effect on your European strategy? Were you thinking of stepping up your European colocation presence there and might this news open any doors in that regard? Or do you see yourself as more conservative when it comes to any type of expansion or the evolution of this strategy in Europe?","Scott Peterson","Yes, Vance, this is Scott. My first comment will be regarding the announcement. We clearly -- we track all the public and private companies in our industry and we're going to continue to monitor this closely. Clearly, consolidation is appropriate as our industry evolves. I'm not sure if anybody wants to handle -- I don't think we're really thinking this is going to change our strategy and our penetration in that region at this time.","Vance Edelson","And then as my quick follow-up, with the pendulum swinging some between build to order, which you mentioned a few months ago you had transitioned to and now you're comfortable building out in small increments I think you said without a signed lease and in certain markets, is the pendulum going to swing more in that direction do you think in that more cities could become attractive for speculative builds? Or do you think this is just a near term opportunity and build to order becomes more dominant again going forward?","Scott Peterson","I think that given our abilities to shorten up the delivery time frames that build to order will continue to be a very significant part of our portfolio. But having said that, we're constantly evaluating markets for speculative development potential and as Bill said right now, there are a handful of markets that are appropriate.","If you were you to track that over time, you would see that it has changed and evolved over the past several years. So we continue to revisit that on a regular basis and we look at the supply and demand and investment potential in these markets. A we will make determinations as to where speculative development is appropriate based on our evaluation of those opportunities.","Operator","The next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Just wanted to go back to the question on the same capital growth, 4%. I think that was expected to be more like 4.5% to 5.5% as of last quarter. Just curious, is that mostly just FX headwinds that caused you to miss on that front, or was there something else going on? And just as a corollary, since the dollar has strengthened some more, there might be some puts and takes on other line items in the guidance, but does that suggest that you're tracking towards the lower end of the range for same capital growth for 2015?","Scott Peterson","So in terms of 2014, we're obviously pleased with our 4% growth in same capital cash NOI. There was a little bit of FX headwind in the fourth quarter as well as some additional unanticipated expenses, primarily some non-routine generator maintenance at some of our properties in the same capital pool that contributed to the -- to missing what we had expected. But again, we're pleased with the 4% growth for 2014.","In terms of 2015, we do conservatively budget and forecast for currency. We typically have a little buffer between where rates are when we go through our process and take a little haircut off of that. I would say at this point we're still comfortable with that range. But as we said overall, in terms of all the guidance metrics that if rates continue to deteriorate, that would obviously have an impact and push us down towards the lower end of the range.","Vincent Chao","Just going back to the disposition, I think last quarter the first nine assets, first bucket was talked about in the $260 million range. I think that was potentially to be sold in the fourth quarter. Just curious, should we be thinking about that $260 million on top of the current guidance for 2015 of $175 million to $400 million or is that just blend into the $175 million to $400 million for 2015?","Scott Peterson","It fits in that number, the $175 million to $400 million.","Operator","And the next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Just in regards to the leasing activity during the quarter, just a lot of it was non-technical space. Just curious what exactly that was.","Matt Miszewski","The non-technical space was primarily office space and I think we covered a little bit of the detail of that in the introductory remarks.","Matt Mercier","Scott talked about that related to the -- sorry, this is Matt, the other Matt. Scott talked about that related to some of the assets that are on our disposition list. So that relates to some leasing we did at some of the non-core, non-data center assets and related to some of the recurring capital that was talked about as well.","Operator","And next question will come from Colby Synesael of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Colby Synesael","Just two related -- a question and a follow-up. So as relates to the product innovation and connectivity, I was wondering if you can just give us an update on your current thinking there, perhaps what's evolved in terms of how you're thinking about building out that product set. And then the second question, a follow-up to that, as it relates to the mid-market success, I was wondering if you could talk about what particular locations you're seeing the most success with that right now. Thanks.","Bill Stein","This is Bill. We clearly had very good success for what is known as our 2N product which is our current offering and that's demonstrated by the very strong leasing results we've had this past year. But we also continue to evaluate the best ways that we can provide solutions to our customers' needs. And as needs change, we remain committed to partnering and providing the best solutions possible to meeting those needs.","So to sum it up, we would see -- I think what we're going to have two products out there, where one would -- actually, we could have a range of products, but we're going to have our traditional 2N product. We will be designing something that provides the flexibility to offer different levels of redundancy.","Colby Synesael","And that would be through a partner?","Matt Miszewski","Part of your question was I think regarding cloud and connectivity, the ecosystem products that we continue to work very closely on. I would say that you will see a heightened focus in 2015 on cloud connectivity products, both products that we manage directly as well as products that are managed by some of our fantastic partners that I mentioned as we move forward. And then our ecosystem and our Open-IX initiatives continue to be well underway and are seeing a great deal of success. And we now landed open Internet exchange operations on both coasts.","In fact, in the 365 main in the most recent installations in 365 main, we've now connected 17 customers directly, 14 of them are in provisioning rights now and nine are pending agreements. And these are the names you would expect, Netflix and the like.","So while we talk about that Open-IX initiative being long-term, we're starting to see the rhythm really pick up. And then Bill and I talk on a regular occasion with folks who provide advanced services such as remote peering and that's really an option that could help to accelerate or speed up that transition. So we're thrilled to see further adoption of our ecosystem products, Open-IX initiatives that we do through partners and then we will see some additional products moving forward.","To get to your mid-market question, there's a couple of answers to that. But our best performance from a regional perspective is currently coming out of our West Coast team and I know they're listening to the call, so hopefully they just cheered downstairs a little bit.","But the West Coast team is doing a pretty good job of performance. In terms of where that is landing, we're seeing a little bit of a mixture of landing places, both in the west, but also our fantastic asset management portfolio and sales teams in the Northeast have been doing a continual great job in the Boston and surrounding markets as well.","Operator","Next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler","Question regarding the recent consolidation that we've seen. So interaction in Telecity and Latisys recently, thoughts on the future, any uptick? This uptick in consolidation, do you think we will see a little bit of a land grab here? Do you think we will see further consolidation across the space as folks look to maintain or increase market share?","Matt Miszewski","We obviously looked at lattices. I think what you will see, what I think you're going to see is a fair amount of private companies that come to market. The public companies have some unique factors. And those factors are basically multiple related and cultural related. And you really I think need to have both to make it work and so it makes it really hard to predict what's going to happen on the public front.","But I do think that with the stock price is recovering in the public sector, you're likely to see more private portfolios come to market and the public companies would have bids for those assets. Scott, do you have anything to add?","Scott Peterson","I think that's spot-on. I think as you see the industry evolve, you see companies trying to expand their product and service offerings for their customers as well as their geographic footprint. So I think you will see that and I don't know if that would qualify so much as a land grab, if you will, but I think it's trying to be a more integrated solution offering to their customers. And I think it's probably, as I said of before, I think it's a reasonable thing to expect as this industry continues to evolve.","Matt Mercier","Jordan, I think you've got unanimity amongst the senior leadership team here at Digital, that we look at everything that happens in the industry, but there's two driving components. There has to be strategic fit. If there's strategic fit, it's something good to look at. But then the economics have to make sense for everybody as well and I don't think we've seen that alignment yet.","Bill Stein","Said differently, we're not going to do a deal just to get bigger. There has be a strategic rationale for it as well.","Jordan Sadler","Along those same lines, Bill, strategically you spent 2014 taking up inventory successfully, leasing quite a bit of it, improving the return on invested capital. What do you foresee and what's the strategic plan for the balance sheet going forward? Do you stay the course on the inventory which seems to be getting a little thinner, or do you build out a little bit more speculatively? I'm just noticing the CapEx guidance, the spending guidance for development is pretty flattish year-over-year.","Matt Miszewski","Well, we tried to address that earlier. I did in my remarks. But we plan to add some speculative inventory in our high demand markets and those markets are Northern Virginia, Dallas, Chicago and Singapore. So we will take speculative risk there as long as we have clear visibility on the demand.","Scott Peterson","And remember, right, 23 megawatts of finished inventory really represents about 5% of the total IT load that we've got out there. We made progress leasing it up last year. I think we're going to continue steadily making that progress and meeting the expectations that Bill helped set for these.","Operator","The next question will come from Jon Petersen of MLV and Company. Please go ahead.","Jon Petersen","I was hoping to get a little more color on your Southwest Mexico investment, redIT I believe is the firm you were invested in. If you guys were able to get a 50% IRR over an 18 month time period, curious why you would sell at this point. I assume it's a desire to simplify, but with returns that well, just curious to get more color on why you stepped away from that investment,. Also if you have any other investments in small data center companies like that you're looking to sell.","Scott Peterson","I think our only regret on that is we didn't have a lot more money invested in it. It was just a unique investment. It was a great way for us to get exposure and access to that market. As it turned out, a strategic buyer showed up with a compelling bid and it was really one -- we weren't really in a controlling position on that. It was one that was really hard to refuse. Hard to argue with taking a profit like that.","Bill Stein","And RedIt was a company that we had sold consulting services to. That was really how we got in the door in the first place there.","Jon Petersen","And then just a follow-up. I believe on the call you mentioned that in the first quarter and third quarter you expect occupancy to dip down due to power based leases. Curious if you can quantify a little more how large those leases are and what condition the data centers will be in as power based leases and what you will do in terms of re-leasing. Will you convert them into Turn-Key?","Matt Mercier","One of the assets in particular is downtown San Francisco CBG asset that we're looking at a couple different alternatives for that property. The other one is also outside of San Francisco, CBD and it's a property that we've had history of taking back shelf space which it will be when the tenant expires converting it to Turn-Key and leasing it successfully.","So I know that's the likely action plan for those -- the majority of that space that we've talked about. I think in terms of hit to occupancy, I'm quoting off memory here, but I believe it's roughly 15 basis points for each of those, 0.15% for each of those spaces.","Operator","Our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup.","Emmanuel Korchman","If we focus on the impairments for a second, looks like a couple of them you had completed redevelopments in 2011, 2012. One of them looked like a data center. What went downhill there that you got to a point where you had to take impairments on them even if you are selling them?","Matt Mercier","I think it was one where it was just part of an overly exuberant development program at the time and in those markets probably had fairly -- well, they did have fairly thin demand at the time. And so it was probably one of those projects that we wish we could have a mulligan on.","Emmanuel Korchman","And then forgive me if I missed, but did you give a revised backlog number since you don't provide a commencement schedule anymore in the presentation?","Bill Stein","No, we don't have a revised backlog number.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matthew Heinz of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Matthew Heinz","So appreciate some of the new slides you gave us around historical return metrics, valuations versus broader REIT universe. But I'm just thinking given the recent lift in public data center peer multiples, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on where we stand now relative to private market multiples and how those spreads might be changing or influencing how you think about the outlook for external growth activity once the efficiency initiatives have run their course.","Scott Peterson","A part of it gets back to what we said is we're always looking at opportunities and we try to evaluate them by is there a strategic fit, does it do something for our Company, but just as importantly does it do something for our shareholders. There have not been a lot of, as you know, a lot of big private market transactions over the last couple of years. Most of them have gone public.","I think the valuations have trended pretty closely between private and public right now, which creates a little bit of friction as it relates to trying to do accretive transactions. Will that change in the future? I have a feeling there will be some changes there. But with public market valuations being so readily accessible, the private market guys look to that to value their portfolio. And they don't really want to leave a lot on the table for the acquiring Company and their shareholders.","Matt Mercier","And sorry, just to follow up on the question that Manny had. If you look at page 7 in the presentation, the backlog we have right now is $108 million.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Schildkraut","I was just looking at your top 20 customers and there seemed to be some notable movements amongst those customers. I thought most surprising was to see Facebook jump up into the top five, especially since we've seen them do some subleasing in some other facilities. I was wondering if there was any incremental color you could offer around movements in the top 20 customers. Thanks.","Matt Miszewski","Sure. So we're always happy to see Facebook move up inside our top 20 list. We've had a historical fantastic relationship and that relationship continued in 2014, especially in Q1 in 2014. So in particular, we also are very solid behind the demand that that particular set of transactions has behind it. So we're very satisfied that their take in 2014 with us is a very long-term relationship in a market that is growing even faster from a social media perspective than is the U.S. market.","Other notable moves, of course we've expanded our exposure to IBM as part of their SoftLayer acquisition. And we welcome that continued movement and that continued relationship across the whole organization.","We were lucky enough to have a great relationship with SoftLayer as they started out and as they grew and as they were acquired we were able to strengthen our relationship with an existing client at IBM and now we're happy to rank them currently number two in the list. But the rapid growth is how we say rapid, so number one might be at risk in a little bit. But we're thrilled to have them amongst the movers and shakers in the top 20.","Bill Stein","Let me add to that. Let me add to that too, Jonathan. If you look at the IBM in particular, they're now in 16 locations with us around the world and that's something we're particularly proud of. I think next quarter you will see additional movement on this list and possibly some new customers of moving onto this and moving up pretty quickly.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead.","Bill Crow","Bill, I want to go back to the M&A discussion briefly. The INXN Telecity deal, our T&T guys think that would have been a great addition for your Company and a great position you to compete against Equinix. Maybe a negative for them. You said you looked at it. I'm just wondering what caused you not to pursue it or did you pursue it but you lost out financially or it's just not the right time for your Company to pursue something like that?","Bill Stein","First of all, Bill, this was really an off-market deal. So neither one of these companies was marketed to the broader data center universe. And if you think back on where we came from last year, it's only recently that our stock price has recovered and give us currency. We've been really focused on the five goals that I laid out last year and we've obviously made very good progress against that. But I think it's fair to say that while we've tracked really both companies, we felt that we weren't ready to take something on like that at that time.","Operator","The next question will come from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Atkin","Yes, so I was interested in the exposure to Houston and the oil and gas sector and are those 1.3 and 1.9%, are they mutually exclusive or is there some overlap there? And in particular, I think in a more fundamental level I'm just interested are you being cautious when you put that exposure on your slide or are there concrete signs and customer behavior that are leading you to take a more cautious stance?","Matt Miszewski","So to address the first, there is overlap between those two as you can imagine. There's a number of parties in oil and gas that are located in Houston. Those are, as of 12\/31, that is our exposure to both those sectors as laid out. I don't think there's anything else to add on top of that.","Scott Peterson","I think that Jonathan, the interesting part of our corporate strategy of diversification of the client base is something that shines here that we're not overexposed to any particular industry when they go through tough times for their own industry. But as I was stating, woe be me to suggest that under penetration in a vertical is a good thing, but under penetration in this case could potentially lead to opportunities.","So we certainly hope that the reduction in the price of oil allows some of the folks in the Houston area to reconsider some of the deployments they are thinking about making or some of the deployments they have made, especially if they're looking at the renewals. And they look at a data center operator that could provide them with a much lower total cost of ownership with their data center facility.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya","Additional question. Bill, just was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Board's mindset and how they're thinking about the replacement for the CFO role, specifically what they're looking for and if there's a sense of timing of how soon that could happen.","Bill Stein","Sure. Well, we've engaged a search firm and they've generated an initial list of candidates. So we're considering both internal and external candidates. I think we have very strong candidates in both categories. In terms of background, my bias here is to find someone who is experienced in capital intensive industries because of the need to have sophistication in terms of balance sheet management. And I think real estate would clearly give you that.","And I think Telco and some networking would do that as well. The advantage of real estate is that not only do you get balance sheet management expertise, but you also get hopefully connections or contacts with institutional investors in the real estate community.","In terms of timing, suffice to say that I hope this will be done in less time than it took to find the CEO. I would expect that since we're running the process here that that's what will happen. And I don't know that that we will have a new CFO by the time of the next call, but it would certainly be nice if we could from where I stand.","Tayo Okusanya","Just one quick other minor question from me. More of a numbers question with the same store NOI for the quarter, just a couple of big moves on the operating expense side especially with property taxes coming down so much. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better.","Matt Mercier","We continually look at our portfolio and find where we can work to get the properties reassessed. And we had expected to achieve a number of lower reassessments for properties in our same -- in the same capital pool. We didn't hit all of them but we got the majority of them and that's what's driving the decline in property taxes over the prior year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jordan Sadler","I wanted to follow up on the M&A discussion a little bit within the market. You mentioned I think, Bill, in response that you would look to do something that was more strategic. You wouldn't look just to get bigger. I'm curious how you would define strategic, if that would be by vertical or product or more geography.","Bill Stein","Really any of the above. So new markets, new products, new services, vertical expertise as well.","Scott Peterson","Jordan, as a follow-up, Jordan, we spent a fair amount of time looking at the lattices deal and we were short listed on that and had great respect for the team there and the Company. But it was one where the pricing was going to a point where it really wasn't going to be very compelling for our shareholders. And as a result, we weren't the most aggressive bidder on that.","Jordan Sadler","Okay. What we can take away from what seems like a hard look at the lattices deal is as opposed to last year when you weren't necessarily ready and you were more focused internally, today given the recovery in the stock and the currency, et cetera and in the portfolio and the ops, that you are more ready relative to last year?","Bill Stein","That's right.","Scott Peterson","Yes. I would agree with that. I think we always evaluate an opportunity based on how well it fits within our strategy, how well it fits within our current portfolio, what it does to enhance our company and our growth prospects and just as importantly is it a compelling investment for our shareholders.","Operator","The next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman. Bill, your talk about Telecity interaction, you talked about where your stock was last year and your desire not to get involved given your cost of capital. Given UK takeover rules and it's a nonbinding deal, that wouldn't preclude you from getting involved at this point, right, if you have the confidence in where your stock is and your cost of capital?","Bill Stein","That's true.","Michael Bilerman","So is that something that would be on the table post?","Bill Stein","Michael, as I said we're going to continue to monitor this transaction as it evolves very closely.","Michael Bilerman","And then just in terms of the backlog, I thought you said page 7 but I'm looking at page 7 and that's absorption of finished inventory.","Matt Mercier","I misspoke. It isn't in the deck. It is $108 million as of the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Trent Trujillo of UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross Nussbaum","It's Ross Nussbaum here. Sorry, I'm on the cell phone. The impairments that you took in the quarter, are those three assets, assets that are included in the held for sale bucket or were these re-evaluated separate from that?","Matt Mercier","They're in the held for sale bucket, that's what ultimately, I'm sorry.","Matt Miszewski","This is Matt. They are not part of the held for sale. Held for sale basically in order to qualify, we do the impairment analysis essentially as one of the first step. Held for sale usually comes along when you're much further along in the process and you've hired a listing broker and you have all your marketing materials. And so those three assets are not part of the held for sale pool.","Ross Nussbaum","But it sounds like you're contemplating closing of those later in the year.","Scott Peterson","Yes, they've been identified as properties for disposition they don't meet the technical qualification of held for sale, but they are on the list of assets to be disposed of this year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Emmanuel Korchman of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Sorry. I didn't realize it was only two and then you go. The question I wanted to ask was continuing a little bit on the impairment. You talked in relation to a question before that the impairments was because you are going to sell the assets so you have to go down and see what the value is relative to what you were carrying them were. Manny asked about one of the assets, you said we wish we could have taken a mulligan on that one, we wouldn't have made the investments that we did.","Have you guys gone through -- and I know impairment accounting is very different than NAV or asset value accounting, but I'm just curious if you have done a full analysis? And I know you guys have presented your NAV before, taking the NOI and just putting a cap rate on it, but I'm curious whether you've actually gone through and said well, let's value each asset as if we were going to sell it to be able to tease out whether there's any other issues like these three assets that would be in the portfolio on a mark-to-market sale basis versus a cap rate analysis on current NOI.","Scott Peterson","What we have done is we took all of the non-core, non-data center assets and we took any of the ones that we might qualify or characterize as underperforming or at risk of underperforming, because maybe short-term nature of leases, as well as any property or project that was going to require significant capital investment over the coming years. And we evaluated each one of those for its current investment potential to identify which ones we think we might have issues with, whether it is to sell them or we might have valuation issues. So yes, we did.","We have gone through all that. What we haven't done to balance all that out is we didn't go and then do a fair evaluation of properties like in Chicago where we bought that with $14 million of NOI and now what, do we have $72 million of NOI there. We probably created $600 million, $700 million of value there. I would say on balance if we did that fairly, the winners would vastly swamp any of the marginal players in that.","Michael Bilerman","And the effective cap rate on current NOI for those three assets would be what?","Scott Peterson","It would be below our current implied cap rate in our portfolio, quite a bit.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to John Stewart, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John J.

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. We had another very productive first quarter, characterized by solid execution against our strategic plan. In particular, we deliberately advanced our global footprint during the quarter, the second of the four guiding principles that we laid out at our Investor Day last October and is shown here on page two of our earnings presentation.","I'm very pleased to announce that we signed a multi-megawatt hangar lease with a hyper-scale cloud service provider in Osaka, totally pre-leasing phase one of our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for the fourth quarter of next year.","We also announced that we established a foothold in Germany with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt. We have begun the local entitlement process and we expect to be in a position to break ground later this year and deliver our first suite in the second half of next year subject to market demand.","As you may recall, Germany and Japan have been our top two target markets. And we're very pleased with our progress during the first quarter, particularly in a manner that is consistent with our overarching objective of delivering superior risk-adjusted returns.","We also delivered solid current period financial results. Andy will take you through the details in his prepared remarks but the out-performance during the first quarter reflects consistent execution on the fourth objective here on page two achieving operating efficiencies to accelerate growth in both cash flow and value per share.","As we have explained, we have made a conscious decision not to go up the stack or compete with our customers or offer managed services. Nor do we intend to directly market to the broader array of enterprise customers and incur the overhead associated with building out the massive sales force necessary to target corporate enterprise directly.","We aim instead to enable our partners to service enterprise customers upon the real estate foundation that we provide.","Our Partners and Alliances program continued to build momentum during the first quarter, adding Sungard Availability Services as a global partner. We are very excited about this partnership, as it highlights our strategy of targeting enterprise via our partners by combining our best-in-class infrastructure with our partners' best-in-class services.","We are in discussions with several other parties about joining our Partners and Alliances program and we have added more resources to the team to support the growth of the program.","In terms of capital recycling, during the first quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of the former Solyndra facility in Fremont, California to a core real estate institutional investor for $37.5 million or $108 per square foot at a 7.2% cap rate on our 2016 contractual cash NOI. We are still under contract on the national 4-property data center portfolio that we mentioned at our last earnings call and at our Investor Day. Due diligence is underway and we expect to close within the next several months.","Let's now turn to market fundamentals. As you can see, from the charts on page three, current construction activity represented by the green bars is most prevalent in Chicago, Dallas, and Northern Virginia. Given the sector's recent history, any uptick in supply bears watching carefully. However, absolute levels of supply should also be considered in context, which we provide here on page four.","First of all, current construction pipelines are generally concentrated in top tier national markets with high visibility on demand and pre-leasing levels are healthy. In addition, market vacancy rates within these markets are in the single-digits, and our own portfolios in these same markets are likewise north of 90% leased.","These markets have also been characterized by robust levels of leasing activity. And in each case, the level of 2015 absorption represents a multiple of two times to three times the level of current supply. Within the context of our own portfolio, we have delivered 38 megawatts of new product into these three markets over the last 12 months and our deliveries were over 94% leased on average. We would expect a similar level of leasing on our current crop of development projects upon delivery.","And now let's turn to the macro environment on page five. Global economic growth has stabilized somewhat over the last 90 days, although, the rate of growth still remains subdued.","Growth of total IT spending is likewise lackluster. As I said before, data center demand is not directly linked to job growth, household formation, or the price of oil and even the growth of total IT spending paints an incomplete picture. We have the good fortune to be levered to a subset of secular demand drivers that are both somewhat independent from and growing much faster than the broader economy as well as the broader IT industry.","Current industry trends are very favorable to our core strategy. Rather than spending more; CIOs, Chief Information Officers, are looking to stretch their IT dollar further, narrowing the focus to core competencies is the order of the day, and outsourcing of corporate IT function is being embraced as a more efficient model.","The rapid growth of cloud adoption is reflection of these same trends. IDC estimates that by 2018, 65% of companies' IT assets are expected to be located off-site in colocation, hosting, and cloud data centers, while one-third of IT staff are expected to be employees of the third party service providers. Similarly, IDC predicts that more than 80% of enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid cloud architectures by 2017.","These hybrid architectures require a colocation presence as well as close proximity to multiple clouds. Along with our partners, we provide the trusted real estate foundation for these deployments. The major cloud service providers are rapidly building out their compute note footprint to meet those demands. With our global foundation of data center solutions, we are uniquely positioned to support this rapid growth as we are one of the very few providers with the ability to meet these large scale requirements on a global basis.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy to take you through our financial results.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bill. Let's begin with an update on Telx here on page seven. Telx generated $92 million of revenue during the first quarter, representing 10% growth year-over-year. Revenues remain split roughly 50%-50% between colocation and interconnection. From its existing 20 locations and prior to expense synergies, Telx generated $38 million of cash EBITDA during the first quarter.","Telx continues to perform at or slightly better than planned on all fronts. And we remain on track to meet or exceed our underwriting targets. Over the past 90 days, the Telx team has been focused on a few key areas within the business. First is our customers, where we continue to grow and expand our key communities and verticals within our Internet gateways.","Second is cash flow where we've been focused on the development of a commercial management team to drive additional revenue. Third is systems; we are in the process of integrating systems between the two organizations which will include a combined customer portal.","With respect to expanding our customer base and nurturing our colocation ecosystem, we have emphasized the continued development of targeted vertical and communities. During the first quarter, Telx added 35 new logos, a 30% up-tick from the number of new logos added during the prior quarter.","In addition to our focus on cloud service providers, we continue to see growth within our Internet gateways and areas such as content, wireless, and mobility services, undersea cable systems, and many other verticals that drive connectivity growth. We have been successful in enhancing the appeal of our facilities by attracting numerous undersea cable systems. We announced the Faster (11:54) and AquaComms cable systems last year and we plan to announce the signing of an additional underseas cable system within the next few weeks. We expect these efforts to continue to drive interconnection growth and offer our customer base continued diversity and global connectivity options from within our facilities.","With regard to the commercial management team, we have been very focused on revenue optimization to ensure accurate and timely billing and collection for space, power, and connectivity within our facilities. This team has increased its focus on pursuing contractual annual rate increases from our colocation customers while within their term and we're working to consolidate licensee contractual agreements across our data center platforms.","With respect to systems, we identified our target IT architecture during the first quarter and we are working quickly to consolidate these platforms, but we want to be sure that we deliver a seamless customer experience before introducing additional complexity to our systems' landscape. We're making solid headway and we expect this effort to continue as a top priority for the next few quarters.","Finally, we recognize that a Customer Portal is one of the top drivers for improving customer satisfaction to our over 1,600 customers. Telx introduced a world-class portal over four years ago to improve service capabilities to drive revenue as well as functionality allowing customers to easily discover and connect to each other. We believe the self-service storefront capabilities in this system, Marketplace, will help retain existing customers while growing the installed base with new entrants seeking the benefit from this developing ecosystem.","We hope many of you will be able to attend Marketplace Live in New York City on September 22 where we plan to unveil several new additions and upgrades to the portal. In summary, while integration is still underway, we remain pleased with the progress and the performance to date.","Let's turn to our leasing activity on page eight. We signed new leases totaling $39 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, including a $6 million contribution from Telx for space and power. In addition, Telx contributed $8 million of annualized interconnection revenue bookings during the first quarter.","Social, mobile, analytics, cloud and content accounted for approximately 80% of our leases signed during the quarter and over 90% was repeat business with existing customers. The combined organization added a total of 41 new logos during the quarter.","The weighted average lag between signings and commencements was eight months, driven primarily by the pre-lease Bill alluded on our first project in Japan. We broke ground earlier this month and delivery is scheduled for next fall. Excluding the new build in Osaka, the lag between signing and commencements was five months, in line with our customary activity.","As shown on page nine, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced now stands at $90 million, the bulk of which is expected to commence this year. I would also like to point out here on page nine that in response to feedback from analysts and investors, we have provided a bridge to reconcile the prior quarter backlog to the $90 million current backlog.","Turning to renewal leasing activity on page 10, we signed a little over $50 million of lease renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed. The average cash re-leasing spread was up 2% with a positive cash mark-to-market on turnkey and colocation renewals, weighed down a bit by a modest cash rent roll-down on a relatively small sample size of PBB renewals during the first quarter.","As mentioned on previous calls, we do still have several remaining above-market scale leases, notably in Phoenix and in pockets of our East Coast portfolio, and we expect a couple of those to hit during the second quarter which will likely result in a cash rent roll-down during the second quarter. We expect to see positive cash re-leasing spreads in the second half of the year and for the full year we still expect to be roughly flat on a cash basis and up in the high single digits on a GAAP basis.","In general, we expect to see continued improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and the steady progress we have made cycling through peak vintage lease expirations.","Turning to our financial results on page 11, we reported 1Q 2016 core FFO per share of $1.42, $0.07 ahead of consensus estimates. Several of the initiatives we outlined at our Investor Day designed to drive additional cash flow from our properties and leverage our scale to achieving operating efficiencies are beginning to bear fruit. And the upside during the first quarter was driven by operating outperformance as well as interest savings. Specifically, $0.01 was due to outperformance from the Digital Realty portfolio and another $0.01 was due to Telx outperformance during the quarter; $0.02 were due to lower than expected overhead. And lastly, interest expense was $0.03 lighter than expected due primarily to the timing and the pricing achieved on the term loan in January and the Eurobond in April.","AFFO per share was likewise well ahead of plan, partially driven by the (17:50) FFO line along with further reductions in straight line rental revenue. Recurring CapEx was also down significantly, although this largely reflects seasonally lighter CapEx spending and we do expect recurring CapEx to pick up over the course of the year.","As you may have seen from the press release, we raised our core FFO per share guidance from $5.45 to $5.60 to a range of $5.55 to $5.65. We raised the projected EBITDA margin by 50 basis points, again reflecting the benefit of the operating efficiencies we have been able to achieve. This is reflected on the G&A line as well at the property level, and we raised both ends of the range for our 2016 same-capital cash NOI growth guidance by 100 basis points, from 0% to 3% to 1% to 4%, or roughly 2% to 5% on a constant currency basis.","Finally, interest rates on the term loan as well as the Eurobond, both came in tighter than expected and we have revised our financing assumptions to reflect the actual capital raised to date. The forecast does still include a potential $300 million to $400 million bond offering later this year.","FX represented roughly 100 basis points to 150 basis points drag on the year-over-year growth in our reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown here on page 12. Although foreign currency headwinds are abating somewhat, the U.K. represents our largest concentration outside the U.S. The dollar is currently stronger compared to the 2015 average sterling exchange rate, and our 2016 outlook contemplates a continued drag of similar magnitude for the remainder of the year.","I would like to remind you that we manage currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt to act as a natural hedge, so only our net assets within a given region are exposed to currency risk from an economic perspective. I would also like to point out that we completed our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April. We raised \u20ac600 million, further enhanced our international hedge and reducing our non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset exposure to less than 10%.","Finally, I'd like to point out that while our global footprint exposes us to currency translation exposure, it also enables us to satisfy data center requirements of strategic customers around the world, which we believe represents a key competitive advantage.","In terms of our first quarter operating performance, same-capital occupancy slipped 10 basis points sequentially. Same-capital cash NOI was up 4.3% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, same-capital cash NOI would have been up approximately 5%.","I'd also like to remind everyone that our 2016 same-store presentation is somewhat theoretical since we have elected to report same-capital results for 2016, as if our leases with Telx were still in place, given that Telx was previously a customer in 11 of our properties, most of which are Internet gateways that comprised a huge chunk of our stabilized portfolio.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on page 13. As previously announced, we closed on the refinancing of our global senior unsecured credit facilities in January. In the process, we were able to tighten pricing by 10 basis points, extend the maturity date by more than two years, and upsize the term loan facilities by 550 $million, including $300 million of seven-year paper.","As you can see from the chart on page 13, the refinancing effectively clears the left hand side of the maturity schedule. We have just under $300 million or less than 5% of total debt coming due before 2020.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we priced our inaugural \u20ac600 million bond offering at a 2.625% coupon in early April. Just to be clear, since it may not have been for everyone, 2.625% was the all-in pricing, not just the spread. We were fortunate to price within one-basis point of the all-time low in the benchmark eight-year mid-swaps rate and needless to say, we were pleased with the execution.","We presented the pro forma impact of the Euro bond issuance here on page 14 of the presentation, and as you can see the eight-year term fit perfectly in the one open slot in our debt maturity ladder in 2024.","Proceeds were used to refinance and term out borrowings on the line of credit and the current balance on the line is less than $100 million with over $1.9 billion of availability. Floating rate debt now represents less than 10% of total debt outstanding.","In addition, as you can see from the co-op box on the left hand side of the chart, the weighted average debt maturity is now 6.8 years, two full years longer than the weighted average maturity as of the end of 1Q 2015.","Terming out over $1 billion of long-term debt does have a dilutive earnings impact, but we believe locking in long-term fixed rate financing from a new source of institutional capital providers is proven financial management. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are maintaining our balance sheet well-positioned for new investment opportunities.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will be pleased to take your questions. Amy, would you please begin the Q&A session?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. First question was regarding the hyper-scale cloud lease, I guess you announced one that sounds like it will commence sometime later next year in Osaka, but just curious overall, the trend has been for pretty significant leasing across the board amongst your peers. You guys had an above average quarter relative to the last couple of quarters, but this is not \u2013 we haven't really seen a spike in overall leasing volume from you guys. Yet you do have some availability and obviously a sizable global footprint. Can you talk about what you're seeing on a hyper-scale cloud requirement side if there is more to do there or what have you?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes, hey, Jordan, it's Matt, and thanks for the question. In with regard to the quarter, of course, my team, my global team is very pleased with our most recent quarter coming in around $40 million kind of as you mentioned, not to mention the welcome revenue contribution of $8 million coming from our interconnection business. It is important to remember when we talk about the current leasing environment out in the industry that we aren't really new to this hyper-scale cloud game.","In fact, while we talked in the opening remarks about the one deal that was an anchor in Osaka, we have done more deals in Q1 with hyper-scale cloud providers as well. And we have been addressing this demand for more than a few years now successfully and during that time period as well as Q1, we captured multiple multi-megawatt requirements from various, not just one, but various hyper-scale cloud service providers around the world. And from our perspective, these requirements may be a little less conspicuous in our quarterly leasing results given the diverse nature of what has become a consistent $30 million to $40 million contribution of quarterly leasing activity.","So, for instance, this quarter, Jordan, about 30% of our signings came from the top three cloud service providers, about an additional 20% came from targeted cloud providers outside of those top three, and then a bit more than 30% came from our diversified stack of social, mobile, analytic, cloud, and content accounts. It's important that we keep in mind that in addition to our quarterly wins here in the U.S. we're also successfully landing requirements in our target global markets. Not simply in Japan, in London as well which tend to be comparatively bluer oceans, where our publicly traded domestic data center, read peers, may not have a dominant presence.","And the final piece of my response would be that, my team, as you know, remains intensely committed to strong leasing fundamentals beneficial to shareholders while we keep our eye on driving this growing hyper-scale demand.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, in terms of capital, I see leverage ticking up to 5.3 times debt to EBITDA and at the same time we've seen some of your smaller peers cap the equity market, given sort of the performance of the stocks and sort of the strong fundamentals seen in your sector. So, how are you guys thinking about equity here?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jordan, it's Andy. So the tick-up was 5.2 times to 5.3 times, but I think I got the gist of your question. So our funding strategy for the year remains the same, the base case is to fund our development with our retained capital proceeds from our asset sales and our debt raises, which are largely finished now.","With that funding strategy, we see our leverage throughout each and every quarter of the year between that targeted 5 times to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA, so right around target levels. In addition right now we have less than $100 million on the revolver. Now, if the facts change and if we see an opportunistic investment opportunity, we will certainly look to issue equity similar to we've done in the past.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. So I was interested in Japan and Germany and what you were doing staffing wise, whether it's sales operations or other as you have obviously done leasing in one market and are going to be developing in another?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Thanks, Jonathan, for the question. With regard to both Japan and Frankfurt, as you know, we have got an EMEA team as well as an Asia Pacific team and in Asia Pacific as we announced last quarter, we brought on a new Managing Director in Ted Higase to be able to help us make sure that we hit that market extremely well. His background in Japan will coincidently or maybe not so coincidentally help us out a great deal in making sure that the Asia Pacific sales team has a head start and being able to hit the demand in Japan.","Similarly in Europe, Wendy Will is our Managing Director for the EMEA team and has the ability to help that team hit new markets including the new markets that we see in Germany. We've got a sufficient staff and leadership employees in EMEA from a sales and sales operations perspective to be able to hit that demand quickly and we have been monitoring the demand pipeline for Germany for quite some time and we've got a significant buildup pipeline that we are ready to clear.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then on the topic of Germany, I think there was a big German bank that was in your top 20 customer list that I don't see this time around, so I was wondering given that situation, the more broadly, if there's any, commentary on churn and customers that are coming in and out of that top 20 list?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Jon, this is Andy. So that change in the customer list, you saw a German bank disappear and you saw HP Enterprises gain some exposure on our top customer list. So essentially that institution transferred over to HP and is essentially outsourcing via that route.","Operator","The next question is from Colby Synesael at Cowen and Company.","Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you. If I'm reading your disclosures properly, it looks like about $7 million of the leasing tied to TKF was tied to power enhancements. And I was hoping if you could talk about that a little bit, maybe what markets and if you had to do anything from an investment perspective to enable that and are those types of opportunities pretty prevalent in the business?","And then I actually just had a fairly high level question maybe more of an educational one for everybody on the call. Can you remind us what's happening with the GICS code change later this year and what if any impact you could see that having on DLR as a stock? Thanks.","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes, thanks and great question. And there was a good deal of leasing in particular in one of our markets in the Central region, one of our great campuses in Chicago, where it was power \u2013 we'll call it power enhancements, but basically driving additional density into the floor space that's already taken by an individual customer.","We think these are fantastic wins for us. From an economic perspective, they're fantastic for us, from a power perspective, they are very good for us, even from a relationship with utilities that we do business with, it increases the utilization of the power that's committed by those individual utilities and we do see density plays continue to play out throughout our portfolio where we can increase the stickiness of those individual customers in our facilities by bringing them additional power.","It's also a great signal that our customers are doing well. In this case, this customer's doing extremely well and is taking power at a rate that we didn't anticipate, but it actually ended up helping a great deal.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Colby, on your second question, and by far no one in this room is an expert on that topic, but essentially, the REIT sub-segment on financial exchanges is coming someone out of the shadows of being grouped with other financial services companies, such as the big banks and will be a standalone component of the indexes. There has been a lot of research reports out and market chatter with the thesis being that there'll be additional focus, attention and we hope capital inflows into REITs in general and especially in the Digital Realty stock.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Chao at Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hey, guys, just one follow-up on just \u2013 maybe a pricing question here. If you take out the $7 million of power expansion, it still seems like the base rents are going up a little bit here per square foot. Just curious if there's anything to read into that of if it's just quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, or it does seem like last few quarters we've seen a steady increase here?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Vin, it's Andy. I think you're just seeing some of the power usage may be inflating it a little bit. I don't think we've seen any rent spikes in any particular market. We think our rents are still running healthy and support our development yields of the 10.5% to 12.5%. We see rents on a comparable basis kind of staying flat to having very modest increases right now.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just another question on the pipeline, the development pipeline, I think it's ended total active development pipeline just under $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Where do you think that'll stabilize out? I mean, will this grow to $1.5 billion at some point or is there some limit on how much you'd grow that to? And then just on the yields that you're showing on that page, they seem like they're down from last quarter. I was just curious to get some commentary on that.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, Vin, the guidance yields are roughly 10.5% to 12.5%. It's really just a function of when you bring on new projects, how leased they are and if the initial yields are a little lower, it depends on the market. But all in all, we see the yields kind of still with our bogey.","In terms of the total size of pipeline, we haven't seen anything right now that's going to have a massive shift or increase in our pipeline. We still have that consistent amount of annual spend. The one point I would clarify though is, while we have $540 million of remaining spend for these projects, some of this is pre-leased, over half of it actually, and some of it is speculative. We're actually only contractually committed to finish roughly $380 million of that, so if the music did stop and there was oversupply delivered to any market, that would represent like 0.3 turns of debt to EBITDA, so our balance sheet leverage would still be in check. And as I mentioned before, we have $1.9 billion of availability on our revolver, so no crisis would ensue.","Operator","The next question comes from Jon Petersen at Jefferies.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","Oh, great, thank you. So, I just wanted to follow up on the hyper-scale lease that you guys signed. And I'm just curious what these conversations are like with these cloud guys. Obviously, you and your peers have been signing a lot of leases. So, I'm just curious when you sit down in meetings with them, is there so much demand that they're just scrambling to try to get as much space as they can or are these more strategic expansions, just trying to get into new markets and the business will grow into it? Just trying to get a sense of whether it is just one big wave, or whether this is just to meet the current demand out there and that's going to continue?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes, I think it is a little bit of a combination of both of those. And it depends on which one of the hyper-scale providers we're talking to and how far along they're in their planned execution and then what type of visibility they have into their own demand. And that really is a little bit different obviously from cloud service provider to cloud service provider. A number of them have had advance plans and it meets with their advanced planning. A number of them have seen a radical shift in terms of the demand coming to them and so in their hot markets which happen to line up with some of our hot markets, they want to occupy as much space and power as they can because they know that they will burn through it and utilize it.","So, it really does depend. I would say about half and half amongst the cloud providers in terms of the current large amounts of deployments that they're going through to hit their current set of demands, but also to make sure that they understand they can cover demand that they historically might have missed because they didn't have inventory in market.","Jonathan M. Petersen - Jefferies LLC","And I guess as my follow-up in terms of the decision they're making to lease space rather than build it themselves, obviously some of these guys like Amazon and Microsoft have the scale to do it themselves and they do. Is the reason that they're doing more leasing just because they need the space and you guys already have entitled space, so it's just easier or is there a strategic reason that they would want to be in a third-party leased facility?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yes, there's a few of them and you can see that a number of these folks have actually done some of the builds themselves in the past. I would say part of that past activity was because of slow changes to the multitenant data center environment to adjust to their needs. I think over the past six months they have been satisfied that multitenant data center providers like us have the ability to hit their needs and their capital is better spent focusing on the strategic imperatives that they have in front of them. So while they may have hit a gap with their own builds, they all have sort of come to the realization that leasing is something that they need to not just explore but execute on. Jarrett...?","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, and just to build on the architecture trends, we talked about multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. It's really important for these cloud service providers to have colocation and interconnection on the campus as well. So I think this is a trend that you're seeing, a value proposition that we can, that they LAN their compute engine and support the cloud, but then enterprises and partners can deliver private clouding connectivity right next door and that's a great value proposition.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Choe at JPMorgan.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Following up on that question, now that you've signed (40:08) in Japan, how should we think about the lease up rate going forward? And I guess along with that, in Germany, do you need an anchor tenant or is demand strong enough where you can kind of move ahead and the sales force is there and everything is kind of set there, demand wise to move ahead with that one?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. Hi, this is Scott. Good questions on that. Japan, that represents phase one and that's 100% preleased with that anchor tenant. So, future development there would be subject to additional market demand. Germany, we want to develop in conjunction with market demand, although there's a pretty strong demonstrated pipeline of demand in that market. So, I think we would feel a little more comfortable pushing forward a little more aggressively there.","Richard Y. Choe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I guess as a follow-up, there wasn't much leasing activity in Europe. Is that mainly due to a lack of inventory in that region?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Yeah. So, as you know, there's a different set of demand drivers inside that European market and you sort of nailed it on the head. In the places where we see the most amount of demand, we found ourselves out of enough inventory to satisfy that demand. So, in particular, in Amsterdam and in London, where we are currently swinging shovels or swinging hammers or a combination of both \u2013 I don't know if you're supposed to swing a shovel \u2013 but it depends on what you're doing I guess. But we are satisfying that problem in London and Amsterdam; the same thing in Frankfurt, where we did have demonstrated demand, but obviously we didn't have a presence there as well.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Heinz of Stifel.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to revisit the leasing results again, and I guess just trying to figure out, if you view the current run rate of about 70 to 80 megawatts annually is translating to an acceptable level of organic growth in the scale business? Or if maybe there's an elevated tightening of your underwriting standards that we should think about?","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","So, in terms of the leasing results, what we do every year and as part of the process of making sure that we understand what our commitments are for the year, we have a very specific leasing plan that we publish and work to and we're pretty satisfied with the leasing plan that we have in front of us right now. And we're pretty satisfied that we can hit the goals that we've set out, both internally and the goals that we've set externally.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","And Matt, this is Andy speaking. So, the underwriting and returns piece of the equation really \u2013 mostly applies to bringing on new supply, where we have to build either buy land or build from the ground up.","We've got a giant portfolio with pockets of vacancy throughout different markets, where it's not \u2013 whether the deal mix are underwriting hurdle, it's about marketing, finding demand and landing in locations. So, that settle the \u2013 underwriting is not always the governor for whether a lease lands or not.","Matthew Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, can you just give us some color on the 100 basis point increase in guidance for same-capital NOI? Is that being partially driven by the G&A improvement and kind of how does that reconcile against the lower pre-stabilized yield, is that factored in at all?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So, those are probably separate parts of our P&L, so same-store capital for NOI is not really pick up new development contributions. Reasons for same-store or our view of increased optimism on same-store drove the results in the first quarter and what we've seen going into the second quarter. I think that's both on the top line and the bottom line.","You mentioned the bottom line is really \u2013 on a NOI basis, it's better operations at the property level. So, I think if you look through our P&L, especially in the same-store side of it, most of our expenses were flat or potentially down in some categories. So, we're running the properties more efficiently.","And then on the top line, we did have some mark-to-market outcomes that were a little bit better than we planned, which is driving some of the increase in the same-store cash NOI growth.","Operator","The next question is from Manny Korchman at Citi.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. If we switch back to the Japan lease for a second, if we just think about the timing there, where they're not going to be occupying until essentially I guess early 2018 at this point touching by your development schedule, how did they think about the capacity that they need? And can we balance that against your comments about not building spec there. Do you think that you could sort of amplify the amount of leasing you could do, if you had the spec \u2013 product that are given unlikely inventory?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. So, hey, Manny, in terms of, just to clarify, actually I think the Japan lease will commence in late 2017. But, it's a good question, in terms of, is the demand that we're seeing not just with that particular and I assume your question applies to more than just the Japan deal and applies across the board with these types of deals that we're seeing. And how do the customers think about what their takes will be? And how do we respond to those?","We've got a really good process actually in place to understand the production capabilities that we have and how those production capabilities match up to what our customers really need, I'll talk about what our customers need. Then I'll turn it over to Jarrett to talk about the production capabilities that we have.","In terms of the way our customers look at this, they still sort of look at it as having a foot in each of these markets, in each of these buildings, in each of these facilities. That usually comes in the shape of at least one, what we used to call pod, but one scale oriented pod, sometimes two-scale oriented pods that they need in short order.","One is generally the size that they need upfront, and then they need to have visibility, so that they're not going to outgrow their needs, and they're not going to outgrow the co-lo needs that they know their customers are going to need in the hybrid cloud environment. And I'll have Jarrett answer the rest of the question.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And I think, Manny, to build on what we just said, I think we talked about at Investor Day, the new agile product that we're rolling out globally. Once we really design two options, the power dense option that you're starting to see and the base option, which is the agility for the client. As well as once we have the shell up, we then can deliver pods, as Matt was talking about, every three months to four months. So, it gives us a lot more agility as we see demand in that market. And so, I think when you pair that, you can sell into a market and meet different customer needs on that timeline.","Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Maybe a question for Andy. So, Andy, if I look at slide 11 of the deck, I guess that's a walkover from consensus to actual. Maybe two questions related to that, if you were to make that left-most column not consensus, but where your expectations were, would the steps sort of be the same, so did you outperform your own expectations as well? And then secondly, how much of this was the timing shift and how much of it is going to impact the rest of the year as sort of more one-time in 1Q?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Sure, Manny, this is Andy. I think that's your third question, but we're going to give you a pass today, because I like you so much. So, the $1.35 was roughly around our internal projections, so we're right in line, so everyone trying to \u2013 kind of these step functions kind of mirror what our internal results look like.","I would say most of these are flow through to the rest of the year, so Digital Realty NOI, Telx EBITDA. G&A, there may be some timing elements to it. Part of that's non-comp related travel consulting, fees like that.","So, if people exceed budgets in subsequent quarters, they're essentially using a budget, they didn't use in the first quarter. And then the lower interest expense, I mean that's a product of two things, the timing of when we did our capital raises and actually our execution on the capital raises.","The one thing I would caveat, it's not as simple as just taking the far right bar, and times it by four to get our full-year number. We do have some items that will reduce that full-year number and offset \u2013 are increases in revenue. One of those is that portfolio of datacenters that we have under contract and to sell, hopefully, in next month or so. That'll obviously be dilutive out of the gate when you sell $120 million-ish of assets that are income producing.","And then the second item is, we basically had the revolver balance at $600 million or $700 million for most of the quarter and then did a $600 million Eurobond. Subsequent to quarter end \u2013 and that was a fixed-rate eight-year piece of paper, which is obviously good for the balance sheet, locks in long-dated FX hedged debt, but is not as low as floating rate revolver debt.","Operator","The next question is from (sic) Jonathan Schildkraut from Evercore ISI.","Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore ISI","Just call me Jeff. Listen, thank you for taking the questions. So, I guess, I asked almost the same question last quarter, but I'm still very interested, and really understand about the progress to keep getting another quarter under the belt of having both Telx and also sort of large campus datacenters and the interplay there, particularly in driving the cloud enterprise ecosystem. So, I'd love to get a little perspective on how that's coming along.","And I guess as a sort of sub-question there, Jarrett gave some good color I think in an earlier response about why the hyper-scale guys are interested in your assets, given the ability to drive that connectivity there as well. But, I'd be interested I guess sort of on the opposite side as to hear about the enterprises coming into connect with the scale cloud guys.","And you did call out the $7.5 million of incremental interconnection fee that you were able to book off of Telx this quarter. And it would be good to get some perspectives, I don't know what it was in the fourth quarter or what it might have looked like a year ago, but is this a number that was in acceleration, in line et cetera. Thank you.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, (sic) Jonathan, this is Andy. I'll take the first part, and then I'll open it up to the team to answer.","The Telx update integration, what you call it, we're making very good progress, as you can see from the numbers in the Investor Presentation. We're on track and it has to exceed our expectations from our initial underwriting.","As previously mentioned on prior call about our investor committee improving Telx expansion under our Ashburn campus, we've now started the pre-sale activity and we should have the doors open there, come September I think you can expect some additional new market expansion done full \u2013 throughout the remainder of the year.","On the West Coast, well, we've been fortunate enough to sign a subsea cable, which we think will enhance our Telx \u2013 the attractiveness of our Telx footprint and our entire footprint in that market. We're also looking \u2013 we're expanding our footprint in Atlanta, where we've been very successful at 56 Marietta. So far so good, as it relates to Telx.","Just not to jump around, but from our interconnection revenue line item, we're tracking year-over-year on just that revenue component, north of 10%, I think it was close to 11%; and then quarter-over-quarter, I think it's well about 2%ish, just for interconnection revenue. And then, I'll turn it over to the team to answer your middle question.","Scott Peterson - Chief Investment Officer","Hey, (sic) Jonathan, Amy, whatever your name is today, really quick on the first part of your question, hopefully to give you a little color on what Andy said and some pretty concrete examples of where we see the combination really coming together quite impressively.","We've been to a number of events where we bring both teams together to address customers. I would say it started very actively with PTC, we've got ITW coming up and we've been at a number of events in between. And what's interesting is the reaction from our customers has been absolutely fantastic. So, not only have they thanked us for coming together, for giving them in essence, one throat to choke for all of their scale, co-lo, cross connect and other services' needs.","But we've seen a number of them actually start to change their own individual organization structure to come to us in the same way that we are now coming to them all in one. So, we've seen \u2013 I've now seen this last week, the fourth large cloud service provider make a decision to consolidate their network folks with their datacenter folks to make sure that they're coming to market the right way. So, I don't know \u2013 I'm not claiming credit, if that's because of what we did, but I'm letting you know that it's landing pretty well, that Telx and large campus together.","Let me get to the heart of what I think Andy turned it over to me for, which is why hyper-scale is coming into Digital Realty, in particular with our set of assets. There's a couple that Jarrett has talked about individually.","One is, first of all, we get hyper-scale, we've been doing hyper-scale before someone truly turned it hyper-scale, we've been doing large deployments and we've figured out how to make a fairly profitable business out of it from the beginning. So, these folks are comfortable, that we know what we're doing and that we've got the size and scale, no pun intended to have a good counterparty on the other side of the transaction for their large compute-node needs.","But they also know that their customers' needs more than simply the ability to provide cloud services through one datacenter, five datacenters throughout the world. They also need to have co-location availability, so that those folks have the ability to land what they cannot put in the public cloud, cannot \u2013 maybe put into a private cloud, we have to put into their enterprise class datacenter and then they need connectivity to bring them all together.","We just came from our client advisory board and several of them came to us and said, we love the idea that we can now get this at one organization. They're looking for ease. They're looking to take the complexity out of the IT transactions that they have in front of them and we are able to act as that vehicle would takes that complexity away.","I would say in the future, we've had some future-oriented conversations about where they're taking the business into the future with their platform-as-a-service offerings. And they are very interested in being involved with the company that has now 1,600 customers, many of them IT service providers, many of them providing the service component, they are putting together into the applications of delivering into the future and they want to be able to offer that to their end customers. And Digital is uniquely situated to be able to provide that value proposition where nobody else can.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I'm looking at your top tenants roster and I compared it to where you were in the fourth quarter and you obviously did quite a bit of leasing with your top 20 tenants between the level threes and the AT&T's and Verizon's, et cetera. I guess I'm curious what percentage of your leasing is existing customers versus new ones at this point?","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","I can tell you the stat from the first quarter \u2013 and the first quarter results from existing are upwards of 93% coming from our existing client base.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. The second question comes on the development pipeline side; it comes from page 34 of your supplemental. Again, the development yield, I guess, on the current pipeline is 10.3%; last quarter, it was 11.2%. And I recognize I think part of that decline, I'm guessing, is you've got Osaka in there for the first time. I assume that's a lower yield, just given interest rates in Japan, you're willing to develop that at a lower yield, I'd be looking for you to A, confirm that?","But B, when I look at the development yields in the U.S. and Europe those also came down a little bit. So I'm just curious, if there's some commentary on the development yields? And then the last part of the development question, the cost went up $10 million in Singapore, and you delayed it a quarter, if you just comment on that one?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Ross, this is Andy. So, you're right, I think the main driver's Osaka bringing down the yield. The other element, I would say is, if you bridge between the last quarter and this quarter, and I think we highlighted in one of our slides, we did deliver, I believe, 13.2 megawatts across Dallas, Chicago, Northern Virginia that was pretty well leased at an attractive yield. And we rolled on some \u2013 really the last phases of our Northern Virginia project before we have to move to our next land \u2013 and some other new phases in Chicago and Dallas, which obviously are less well leased.","And we include our underwriting estimate in this table until leasing actually comes in. And we typically outperform our underwriting, when we hit the leasing, you'll potentially see these yields go up. And then the other question was, Singapore timing...","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","And cost.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","...and cost. Maybe FX rates would be a driver there; I think we're either at budget or under budget there. I know we have the ribbon-cutting ceremony in May or June.","William Stein - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the ribbon-cutting's the first week of June for Singapore. We did stage it \u2013 first, we have some marketing efforts over there \u2013 but it is the second quarter and it's still scheduled for June.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Ross, my guess is FX related on the cost side, but we'll follow-up just to check.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jordan Sadler at KeyBanc Capital.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I was just hoping to follow up on the Telx run rate on the EBITDA. I guess I'm looking at the number from the deck and on a run rate basis it seems like you guys are running a bit ahead, maybe 5% ahead, of the $148 million. Can you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes or how we should be thinking about how EBITDA flows from Telx during the year?","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Jordan. So, as a reminder, that top row was our initial underwriting when we announced the transaction back in the middle of July, the key and repeated number, $148 million plus of cash EBITDA. We are, I would say, ahead of plan for just the first quarter. Some of that beat was on the expense side that may have been a little seasonal and timing related, the timing for the annual SKO, or sales kick-off and marketing and sales initiatives around that event, actually moved. Last year it was in the first quarter; we actually pulled it forward and did in December this past year. So, again, that's probably not a number you can necessarily just annualize to get the run rate.","We are ramping additional resources on the sales and marketing front there, but all-in-all we're making good progress on the revenue and the EBITDA line item and feel like we're on track to meet or exceed our underwriting estimates.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then separately, just in the partners and alliances program, can you maybe just give us a sense, how do you get \u2013 how are you confident in that program and the potential of that program or what gives you confidence, should I say \u2013 as opposed to the other route of sort of bolstering or building out the sales platform like some of your competitors have?","Matt Miszewski - Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Yeah. Thanks, Jordan. First of all, Bill and Andy won't let me build out the sales force to address that potential demand and I am happily compliant with not building it out. And just to be clear, right, it was \u2013 it clearly is a differentiator between us and other folks in this industry. So, it was not that we didn't have some trepidation in making the decision to address a large segment of the potential revenue in what amounts to an entirely different way for us as a company.","So, that was not without personal risk on my side, but also just a little bit of risk on our side, but it's a great question. How do we feel confident that it's going \u2013 two main components make me feel confident \u2013 and the first, it always starts with our customers. I think during the last earnings call we had just come from a meeting with one of our top five customers, and the reception from us having a conversation with those C-level folks and talking to them about not competing with them and asking for their support and signing up for the partnership program and being actively involved in helping us pass leads back and forth and being true partners, gives me a great deal of confidence.","And then secondly, nothing brings confidence like pipeline, especially in my particular world. And so, the guys this year said, in the first quarter have already generated $40.1 million in pipeline inside G&A to date.","Now, obviously we do not close all of that pipeline and we're starting small and learning, make sure we get it right and we are growing the program as we move it forward; added another program to the reseller partnership program this particular quarter. We'll continue doing that with some of our key partners moving forward. But nothing gives me peace of mind like having $40 million in pipe in a brand new program.","Operator","The next question is from Jonathan Atkin at RBC Capital.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. So just on Telx, when you made the announcement, you talked about some of the underutilized capacity out on the West Coast and it looks like you made some progress in Seattle if I'm reading the portfolio detail correctly, but less so in Santa Clara, and maybe just more generally, can you comment on where you're seeing success more versus less in the acquired assets.","And then, the other question I wanted to ask was just on recurring CapEx, and I think Andy mentioned it's going to pick up in the latter part of the year. What's driving that? Thanks.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jonathan, it's Andy. So, we're seeing, I would say, increases in our occupancy utilization pretty much across the board. I'd say from a utilization standpoint, we're kind on track with our plan moving into the 70%s now. And I didn't mention we had some wins that signed that I mentioned for the undersea cable actually hasn't flowed through the utilization just yet ,and actually will probably be something that's more attractive to draw (65:29) customers to that location.","I know we see a lot of demand pointed at our Telx location in Santa Clara. And we continue to see tremendous success, be it at Cermak or 56 Marietta in Atlanta, or the New York City Trifecta. So I can't tell you one asset is pulling far, far ahead in terms of percent change from another, so it's been kind of fairly broad-based.","And then your second question was about CapEx, I think it's really just timing related, as you can see, from our AFFO reconciliation, if you take those last three line items before our AFFO, they sum less than $26 million of recurring CapEx and commission and compensation for the quarter. But if you multiply that by four that's like a \u2013 just a $100-ish million of recurring CapEx. And we have affirmed our guidance table North of $145 million for the full year. So, I think it's just a function of timing and didn't want anyone to think that that lower number could be truly run rated throughout the rest of the year.","Jarrett Appleby - Chief Operating Officer","And hey, Jonathan, to give you a little more color on the West Coast activity. We've really integrated the efforts of the West Coast team that we have had historically at Digital with the West Coast team, especially on the business solutions side with the Telx Group and a number of the properties that we've looking at, end up having enough contiguous space to be attractive to the digital traditional sales methodology.","Now the challenge with that is the Telx sales methodology has a tighter turn, a quicker return, and a faster rate of adoption. The larger deals that we see going up against the Santa Clara facility, as well as the Seattle facility, as well as the Portland facility that we have simply larger deals take a little bit longer for us to close. But the cooperation is working exactly as planned.","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Stein for closing remarks.","Andrew Power - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Amy. I'd like to wrap up our call today by recapping our first quarter highlights, as outlined here on page 15.","First, we made significant progress towards extending our global footprint to our top two target markets with the acquisition of a land parcel in Frankfurt and the signing of an anchor lease on our first project in Japan.","We also made headway towards a strategic objective of achieving operating efficiencies to drive accelerating growth in cash flow per share. And we delivered first quarter results well ahead of our own forecast and $0.07 ahead of consensus. We raised guidance by $0.075 at the midpoint on the strength of the beat in the first quarter. And finally, we further strengthened our balance sheet with the success of refinancing of our global credit facilities in January and the completion of our inaugural Eurobond offering in early April.","In conclusion, I'd like to say thank you to the entire Digital Realty team, whose hard work and dedication is directly responsible for this consistent execution against our strategic plan.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Digital Realty 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Stewart, you may begin your conference, sir.","John Stewart","Thank you. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Digital Realty Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. The speakers on today's call will be CEO Mike Foust; CFO and Chief Investment Officer, Bill Stein; and SVP of Sales and Marketing, Matt Miszewski. By now you should have all received copies of our press release and supplemental. In addition, we posted a presentation to the Investors section of our website, which is designed to accompany management's prepared remarks. You're welcome to download the presentation and follow along throughout the call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that management may make forward-looking statements on this call.

Management's prepared remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Foust. Mike, would you like to begin?","Michael F. Foust","Thank you, John, welcome to the call everyone. The highlight of our third quarter for Digital Realty was our solid leasing activity. Our business has taken a turn for the better and healthy momentum has picked up across each of our regions. Data center demand is growing in the second half of the year, and we're quite pleased with the leasing velocity.","In fact, as you can see on the first page of our presentation, the dollar volume of leases signed represents the third highest quarter in the company's history and year-to-date activity already exceeds the full year of 2012. New leases include a healthy mix of new corporate logos, as well as expansions of existing customers to new facilities.","As shown on Page 2, the third quarter was equally strong in terms of lease renewals. I'm sure most of you saw last week that we completed 5 early renewals with Equinix. This was a mutually beneficial transaction, providing long-term operational certainty to a strategic customer. And from Digital's perspective, these leases contributed to the positive mark-to-market on renewal activity during the third quarter.","Cash rents on turn-key leases rolled down slightly, but represented an improvement over the past several quarters. We believe that rumors of data center rent roll downs have been greatly exaggerated. We estimate the mark-to-market across our Powered Base Building portfolio at 6% -- over 6% actually and the cash mark-to-market across our Turn-Key data center portfolio is roughly flat.","We are encouraged by the recent trends in pricing, as well as the leasing velocity. Despite the leasing highlights, third quarter financial results were lower than expected. Bill will walk us through the drivers behind our revised earnings guidance in detail during his presentation. But suffice it to say that primarily the combination of the noncash straight rent -- straight-line rent adjustment, delayed lease commencements and the near-term dilution from the joint venture we announced earlier this month has led us to revise our guidance for 2013 and to reset expectations for future periods.","We do believe that our revised outlook represents a realistic assessment and puts us in position to provide more accurate lease commencement forecasts going forward.","Turning now to Page 3 of the presentation. We are encouraged by the pickup in leasing velocity that we've seen in the second half of the year, and pricing has largely stabilized relative to last year. Furthermore, the solid backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced represents contractual obligations for future rental revenue and sets the stage for healthy growth and cash flows over the intermediate term.","As you can see from this chart, the backlog of signed leases translates to an incremental $52 million of NOI in 2014 and additional $38 million in NOI beyond that. We're also pleased to announce today that on Monday this week, we signed a 7-megawatt lease with a social networking company that had outgrown its existing colocation footprint. This one deal represents an additional $11 million of annualized GAAP revenue, and is tangible evidence that the momentum we saw during the third quarter is clearly carrying through to the fourth quarter.","The healthy backlog aside, we are taking proactive steps to address the lumpiness of our leasing activity, as well as the signing-to-commencement cycle. And Matt will walk through some of these steps in detail during his presentation.","In terms of supply and demand, as shown on Page 4, we currently are tracking an estimated 3-megawatt shortfall nationwide. Silicon Valley is the one major market in the U.S. at risk of significant oversupply, whereas demand has been particularly strong in Northern Virginia, as well as in Dallas.","Amsterdam, London and Frankfurt are currently the healthiest markets in Europe, and supply-demand dynamics are generally favorable across AsiaPac.","Over the past 2 years, Digital Realty has made significant investment in developing additional inventory to meet growing demand, and this accounts for some of the new supply you see represented in the chart on Page 5. We expect that this new inventory in our major -- active major markets will be largely absorbed by corporate enterprise and cloud services demand over the next 12 to 24 months.","In the near-term, however, the delivery of this inventory will continue to weigh on our return on invested capital. Lease up of existing inventory and driving improved ROIC are the top priorities across our organization. We fully expect to generate attractive returns on these new completions as we lease up our inventory and maintain our focus on consistent improvement on return on invested capital. In the near term, new development starts will be more measured and lease up of existing inventory will likewise be our primary source of near-term organic growth.","In late September, we formed the previously announced $369 million joint venture with Prudential's Core fund at an attractive cap rate. Aside from our return on this investment, which Bill will cover in his remarks, we believe that this transaction was an important milestone in terms of demonstrating the appeal of data centers from the perspective of a sophisticated Core investor. I would like to point out that growing acceptance of this asset class is a bit of a dual-edged sword. On the one hand, it has very positive implications for the private market value of our portfolio. On the other hand, lower return expectation on the part of Core investors do make it more difficult for us to achieve external growth through acquisitions of income-producing properties.","Consequently, while we remained active and will continue to underwrite almost every deal and portfolio in the market, our near-term investment activity is likely to be more consistent with our pre-2012 history, until some of our expectations readjust consistent with our return requirements and our investment alternatives.","During the third quarter, we introduced Digital Open Internet Exchange, which is running in conjunction with the Open IX initiative spearheaded by the Internet community here in North America. In short, we've committed to provide the data center environments for the new open Internet exchanges so that they can operate across all the targeted U.S. markets, for Open IX, as well as international exchanges that are expanding currently into the U.S.","Our facilities will provide the foundation for a successful initiative, and we're very excited to be a part of it. On a related note, the Digital Realty Network ecosystem continues to develop on schedule. And we are now seeing new leasing opportunities with specific network requirements that our ecosystem and Open IX, allows to solve for our customers. It's too early to quantify the near-term financial impact from these initiatives, but we believe they will significantly enhance the appeal of our properties to a wider range of tenants and, in turn, our ability to generate future NOI growth and enhance the value of our portfolio over time.","And with that, I would like to turn the floor over to Matt Miszewski for a deeper dive on our sales platform and leasing momentum.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. Let me jump right into the sales activity for the third quarter. It was a strong quarter for lease signings, and we continue to see positive momentum. In fact, this was the third highest quarter for lease signings in the company's history. Our year-to-date signings are about 40% higher than at this point last year, and as you see here on Page 6 of the presentation, already surpass full year 2012 activity.","As of today, we are at over 91% of the highest signings year in the history of the company with just over 2 months left in the fiscal, and all regions provided positive signings momentum in the third quarter across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.","And while this quarter's performance was solid, the future also looks bright. Our pipeline continues to see accelerating growth in qualified deals in North America, Europe and APAC with both healthy domestic and international components. We currently have over 2 million raised floor square feet requirements in our fiscal year 2014 pipeline. In addition, over the past 90 days, we've implemented a number of lead generation and nurturing tools to continue to build our already healthy pipeline.","In our first test of this system over the past few weeks, we are seeing solid metrics supporting our new content marketing, inside sales and digital demand generation programs, including impressive open rates on new offers, healthy new lead generation statistics and encouraging lead conversion rates.","In addition to this pipeline activity, we also closed a significant number of mid-market deals inside the quarter, including a rapidly growing cloud services provider in SingleHop [ph] in the Midwest, taking 1,500 kilowatts in our Franklin Park facility, as well as a well-known online travel advice company taking a total of 1,400 kilowatts across multiple locations inside our portfolio.","In our colocation business, we continue to see mid-market penetration in the quarter, including one of the globe's top enterprise private cloud providers, as well as the country's fastest-growing mobile cloud platform company in one of our Boston facilities. We also continue to add new logos at multiple properties and in multiple segments. Our unique build-to-suit project with ARM Holdings highlighted our commitment to environmental innovation, while our new signings with a global leader in virtualization technologies highlight our global platform as they took space in both the Dallas and the San Francisco markets.","We continue our new logo success in the financial services vertical with a national provider of diversified financial products in one of our Chicago facilities. And we also landed new leases with a true global software and cloud powerhouse in Australia and with one of the world's largest manufacturers of industrial engines, Cummins.","I'd now like to cover some of the organizational adjustments we have made in our global sales and marketing program since the beginning of the year. Programs I'll describe for you in a moment, including our mid-market and global alliance strategies, are expressly designed to shorten the signings-to-commencement cycles, as well as addressing our premium pricing support.","In addition, adjustments to our incentive compensation programs will focus on targeting existing inventory clearance to drive improved return on invested capital and continue to shorten commencement time line.","Turning now to Page 7. With regard to our new global alliances program, our customers are asking us to provide them with insightful guidance across all of their needed data center services, not simply space and power. By providing them with a comprehensive global alliances marketplace, we will be able to satisfy our customers' requirements, while providing additional revenue opportunities to some of our closest, existing and exciting new partners.","As pressures increase on our customer base, they need their data center decisions to be easier, and we hope to make Digital Realty their one-stop shop for a data center advantage. While Digital will continue to focus on its core strategic advantages, we will leverage our new partner ecosystem to provide high demand services, including managed services, cloud services, network services and more.","In addition, we will be providing guidance to our customers from their perspective, initiating a vertical go-to-market process across multiple industry verticals, ranging from financial services, cloud services and manufacturing to energy, health care and retail.","By focusing on our customers' needs as the primary focal point of our sales and marketing efforts, we believe we'll be able to more accurately fit their requirements and jointly create increasing value across the multiple segments from lead generation and nurturing into a growing level of customer loyalty, ultimately resulting in a solid renewal rate amongst our base.","As shown on Page 8, we have also developed a new focus on the mid-market segment as an area that holds great promise in terms of shortening our sales cycle, keeping stable our pricing advantage, compressing the average time to commencement and broadening our installed base across our global platform. We have also begun developing muscle in addressing the small and medium-sized business segment, with a lower cost-of-sale model that will allow us to continue serving this segment by leveraging a more aggressive demand-generation program and a scalable new sales force.","We are adding significant sales and marketing resources to successfully execute this multi-segment strategy. While we increase our focus on these 2 segments, it is important to point out that our large enterprise segment continues to perform incredibly well. Demand from that segment drove the healthy signings volume in the third quarter, including multiple purchases from one of the largest financial services firms on the planet now in multiple countries. We have also continued to see large expansions from global cloud services providers and have landed large enterprise logos as well, including a leading Japanese automobile manufacturer.","We expect that this segment will continue to be strong for Digital. We simply view the mid-market and small- and medium-sized business focus to be additive to our longstanding large enterprise program. The longer sales cycles in large enterprise accounts can now be balanced with a more complete program to address the mid-market and small- and medium-sized business segment. We expect that this segmented strategy will continue to close the gap between lease signings and commencements and help to smooth out revenue from quarter-to-quarter.","And as highlighted earlier, we also saw mid-market deals close across multiple verticals and across every geographic market we serve, including multiple new logos and deals that will commence in a much shorter time frame.","And now I'll turn the call over to Bill.","Arthur William Stein","Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by addressing the straight-line rent expense adjustment that Mike mentioned in his remarks. We booked a $10 million noncash true-up in the third quarter because we discovered that we had not previously remeasured the straight-line rent expense related to one of the handful of leasehold interests in our portfolio when we executed a 10-year early extension and modification of this leasehold in September of 2010.","The $10 million adjustment that we booked during the quarter represents a catch-up of the noncash straight-line rent that should have been recorded from the fourth quarter of 2010 through the third quarter of 2013 at a run rate of approximately $830,000 per quarter.","The entire prior-period adjustment has been included in reported FFO, whereas only the current period of $830,000 has been included in core FFO for the third quarter of 2013. Let me emphasize that the straight-line rent is always and everywhere an add back to FFO in the calculation of AFFO. So there is no impact on AFFO, regardless, for any period involved.","Since the annualized straight-line rent expense adjustment represents an immaterial percentage of net income in each of the affected periods, we believe that it is not material. Consequently, we currently believe that it is unlikely to give rise to a material weakness. We believe that our internal controls are adequate. We have since reinforced our existing policies and implemented supplemental policies to address this specific issue. We believe that we've taken the right steps and have fixed the problem. If we can better help you understand the nature of the issue or its resolution during the Q&A portion of today's call, we'll be happy to do so.","Moving on to our results. We reported third quarter FFO per share of $1.10 and core FFO per share of $1.16 compared to the consensus analyst estimate of $1.20.","Starting on Page 9 of the presentation, let me walk through the various components and attempt to bridge the gap from our third quarter results to the $1.22 we reported in the second quarter as a proxy for the consensus estimate. The first item to note is the $10 million straight-line rent expense adjustment for 111 Eighth Avenue in New York. The entire $10 million adjustment, or a little over $0.07 per share, is included in reported FFO. In contrast, only the current period portion of $830,000, or less than $0.01 a share, is included in core FFO for the third quarter of 2013.","Higher property taxes costs us a little over $0.01 per share this quarter, primarily due to additional county personal property taxes assessments in Santa Clara and in Texas. We believe these personal property taxes estimates represent double, and in some cases potentially triple, taxation since the counties charge personal property taxes but do not deduct personal property from a real estate assessment, and our tenants are taxed on their personal property as well. We will, of course, appeal these aggressive assessments, but in the meantime, we have accrued for the higher rates.","The second quarter also included $0.04 from a gain on an insurance settlement, as well as an extra $0.01 of catch-up from the first quarter for the change in capitalization policy announced on the last call. Finally, G&A accounts for $0.02 of favorable variance in the third quarter since our independent directors are awarded a fully vested equity grant in the second quarter of each year.","Adjusting the future run rate for each of these items gets you to the clean quarterly run rate of $1.14 to $1.15 or $4.60 annualized. This represents the base from which future growth forecasts should be framed, in our view.","Moving on to Page 11 and turning now to our outlook going forward. We are revising our 2013 FFO per share guidance to $4.60 to $4.62, down from $4.73 to $4.82 previously, and revising guidance for 2013 core FFO per share to $4.65 to $4.67, down from the prior range of $4.74 to $4.83. The primary variables relative to our prior forecast include $0.07 per share for the straight-line rent accrual on 111 Eighth, $0.01 per share due to the lower-than-expected acquisitions. The joint venture with the Prudential Core fund is $0.11 dilutive on an annualized basis, so we will see $0.03 of that in the fourth quarter and another $0.08 next year.","Finally, delayed lease commencements account for $0.06 per share. In hindsight, our sales forecasts for recognized revenue have been too aggressive. Our signings have been on target, but revenue recognition has not lined up with our projections. Nevertheless, as Mike pointed out during his remarks and as you can see, if you refer back to Page 3 of the presentation, the backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced does represent an extremely strong tailwind of contractually baked-in NOI that will come online over the intermediate term.","We are still in the process of finalizing our budgets for next year, so we are not providing formal guidance for 2014 at this time. But we have outlined the broad brush strokes for next year in the earnings release. Clearly, the pace of our earnings growth has moderated somewhat as our sector has matured and the size of our asset base has grown dramatically. Even so, we expect to deliver respectable mid-single digits FFO per share growth, even on a $13 billion asset base.","And now I would like to turn to our funding strategy and capital markets activities. As previously announced, we refinanced our global credit facilities in August, upsizing the line of credit from $1.8 billion to $2 billion and the term loan from $750 million to $1 billion. All-in pricing for the line of credit was reduced from 150 basis points to 130 basis points and all-in pricing for the term loan was reduced from 145 basis points to 120 basis points.","In late September, we formed a $369 million joint venture with Prudential Real Estate Investors, as Mike mentioned, at a 6.7% cap rate. Since this transaction has already been announced, I'm not going to dwell on too many of the details here on Page 12.","But I would like to highlight 2 numbers, mid-teens and 20, that I think have been largely overlooked with respect to this transaction. Specifically, we achieved an unlevered IRR of over 20% on the sale of our interest to the joint venture and we expect to earn a mid-teens return on our residual equity interest going forward. I also think it's important to note that the fee-stream figured into the pricing of the transaction. Said differently, the cap rate unquestionably would have been lower had this been structured as an outright sale rather than a joint venture.","We believe that this transaction represents very solid execution and achieved our objectives of maximizing the menu of capital options available to us, while minimizing the related costs and simultaneously demonstrating the appeal of our data centers to a core institutional real estate investor. Proceeds from the joint venture have initially been used to pay down short-term debt. And as you can see from the credit stats on Page 13, we maintain a flexible investment grade balance sheet. We do not expect to need to access common equity in 2014, barring any unusual portfolio or M&A transaction activity. We do, however, expect to raise preferred equity sooner rather than later, and may also revisit the corporate unsecured bond markets as well to take advantage of what we believe is an attractive low rate window. The front loading of these anticipated long-term capital raises is one of the drivers behind our below consensus outlook for next year. But we believe it is the prudent course of balance sheet management. I would also like to point out that our exchangeable debentures are expected to convert into common equity in April of next year and that conversion will improve the debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3 turns.","As indicated in yesterday's press release, our Board of Directors recently authorized a $500 million share repurchase to give us the flexibility to opportunistically buy back stock when the public market values our portfolio at a meaningful discount to the private market value. At present, however, we believe the double-digit yields that we are achieving on development still represent the best risk-adjusted returns available to us.","In closing, I would like to draw your attention to several enhancements that we've made to our quarterly supplemental package in direct response to feedback from the investment community on our disclosure practices. As you can see on Page 32 of the supplemental, we've added a new schedule with details on our land holdings, including acreage, as well as our cost basis. In addition to the leasing activity typically disclosed, on Pages 29 and 30, in our traditional schedule, we've modified the format and added the following new metrics: the initial stabilized cash rent per square foot for new leases; the change in cash rents on renewal leases; tenant retention; and rolling 12 months in addition to the current quarter's activity.","The presentation that we posted on the website to accompany today's call is a further step in the direction of improving our communication with The Street. We aim to continue to improve the transparency of our financial disclosures over time and we welcome additional input from analysts and investors in that process.","This concludes today's prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call back over to the operator and we will be pleased to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So my first question is really regarding sort of the guidance and how it is sort of not necessarily parallel to the leasing that was done during the quarter. So maybe just drilling down on leasing a little bit, can you maybe characterize what you think the leasing -- what will happen to the leasing volume over the course of the next 5 quarters? You mentioned the momentum continued in 4Q, but is it expected to slow materially next year?","Arthur William Stein","The signings are not expected to slow, but what we've been experiencing is a lag in commencements from signings, and that's really a function of the large enterprise customers. They're taking significant amounts of space. And there's a natural, I'd say impediment, to their ability to absorb all that space immediately based on just their needs. So that's taken down over a period of time. And that's the point of that backlog slide, is a lot of this business has been signed up but it will not commence for as much as 6 quarters away.","Michael F. Foust","That's right. So especially with the large tenants, like the one we signed earlier this week, where they're taking multiple pods, they'll phase in 1 or 2 pods at a time and that may take place over a 12- to 18-month period. And so then you have a delay in commencement for each of those phases as they lease in. But the income is there as you can see in that NOI build up. So the asset value and future -- near future cash flows and NOI will go up pretty significantly.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you think about bracketing what NOI growth might look like for next year?","Michael F. Foust","Well, if you look on Page 3 on the accompanying slide deck, we break that out for you, and I think in a conservative fashion. This is our -- and this is our backlog. So this slide represents actually signed leases and the contractual backlog that is already baked. So new leasing will be on top of that.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So, right, so this is no -- this $952 million for 2014 includes no new leasing?","Michael F. Foust","That's correct.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But that's not necessarily your assumption?","Arthur William Stein","Of course, not.","Michael F. Foust","That is correct. That is not our assumption. That is the minimum baked contractual without any of the good leasing that Matt and his team are doing.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the guidance, you said that you're looking to front-load some of this issuance? Any of the other levers where there's been sort of a conservative treatment so we could understand where the potential upside is here. Because obviously, being 7% below consensus with this initial guidance, it seems a little bit shocking to everybody, the stocks are reacting in that fashion. But it does seem like you guys have reset the bar somewhat. So any other sort of leverage you'd point to where you've tried to take the conservative route besides the sort of, that front-loading the debt?","Arthur William Stein","Well, there's a reduction in capitalized interest that reflects the reduction in capital expenditures. But to the extent that leasing demand merits it, there will probably be additional CapEx towards the end of year or there could be, which would affect the capitalized interest. Right now, there's about a 20% reduction in capitalized interest. I think the other thing to keep in mind, Jordan, is that the JV adversely affects the -- 2014 to the tune of about $0.03 a quarter and obviously, that's in 2013, but it's not in the next 3 quarters of 2014.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","On Page 34 of the supplement, you guys list about $561 million of construction in progress. How much of that is going to need to be spent in 2014? And if I'm understanding your comments from earlier, you guys are intending to fund this with debt and preferred, or are you going to need a second JV or some sort of other equity in order to fund that?","Arthur William Stein","I think that most of that's going to be spent next year. And we have enough liquidity on our revolver to fund that without any additional equity. You'll see in our guidance that we're assuming a preferred issuance. On the JV front, we are assuming up to $400 million of additional JV proceeds. But we don't need a JV to fund that construction program.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Mike, if you guys were to do another JV, is it also likely, given what you've demand-wise, to be Powered Base assets? And so sort of can you contrast institutional investor demand in a JV format for Turn-Key assets versus Powered Base given the sort of longer-term triple-net leases of those assets?","Michael F. Foust","If we were to do another tranche with a core investor, likely it would be -- it would have some Turn-Key in it but the majority would be Powered Base, likely. It's potentially that we would look at, at other types of investors who may be more core plus, who would look at Turn-Key assets. But right now, we have a limited amount -- number of properties that we would even contemplate at this point putting in a joint venture, and they'd be more geared toward core with a little bit of Turn-Key.","Arthur William Stein","Rob, let me add to that. The way we see ourselves using private capital next year would be to supplement our acquisitions program and enhance the returns on our retained equity. So if you think about the Prudential JV that we did with an 80-20 structure, just think about applying that to a future stabilized acquisition where we retain 20%. But instead of a market cap rate that is, say, call it 7-ish, just for the sake of argument, but it could be under 7, through fees we may be able to boost that into the low double-digits, if not higher, as we did with this JV. So obviously, making the opportunity far more accretive.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Manny Korchman is on with me as well. Bill, just to start with you, can you just sort of go in a little bit more on the development side just so we're really clear as to what's happening currently and into the future? You talked about $800 million dollars of projects that are expected to deliver in '13 at 10% to 12% yields. And I want to understand how much of that will be in the numbers by the end of the year in terms of that run rate? But then the disclosure for 2014 talks about $600 million to $800 million of spend, not necessarily what's getting delivered. And with about $561 million left to spend on the current development pipeline, that would indicate that you're really not starting any new -- or much new development next year at all. And I want to make sure we're thinking about that the right way.","Arthur William Stein","I'll take the second question first. So the capital that's highlighted for 2014 is the spend in 2014. But it's also likely to be close to deliveries as well. There may be some carryover into 2015, but predominantly 2014. And you are right. Most of what's been highlighted for 2015 is either to complete existing projects or it's to honor commitments that we've made to customers for leases that they've signed. So it's really to finish projects that have signed lease commitments. And as for the capital that is in the guidance for 2013 with respect to deliveries, virtually all of that is in the numbers except for whatever is to commence this quarter.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just sticking with commencements. Mike, this is not the first quarter where you sort of had a delay in commencements. If you go back to last year, there was, I believe, 2 quarters where you pushed things out. And I'm just curious what internally from a function perspective are you doing that you can't get ahead of this, because it's a pretty material changes each time in terms of that delay. And while I respect that leasing and the numbers are large, you do have a large portfolio suite, we would hope it would be growing. But why -- is there something internally that was off in terms of tracking this stuff? And I guess, why hadn't you gotten further ahead of it that we're now talking about further delays in that cycle?","Michael F. Foust","That's a good question. And I think part of the challenge is a lot of our customers -- it's not internal methodology and how we're leasing. It really has to do with the decision-making process with our customers. And these large customers, for the most part, this is their first outsourcing and the first of many. So we're working with them in a pretty close partnership. And frankly, in many cases, what their time frames for when they want to complete a lease and they want to get up and running, it has slid more than they thought, more than we thought. And clearly, we haven't been conservative enough in putting in more wiggle room in the time frames for when these deals get actually signed. And then that gets compounded a little bit because on these larger deals, the ramp up, when someone is taking 3, 4, 7 megawatts, you have typically an 18- sometimes even a 24-month ramp on that long-term lease. So I think it's that combination of really spearheading this growing trend for outsourcing, as well as the ramp up. And as Matt went into detail, our mid-market and SMB program, we look to bring in more customers in that middle range, where they'll take space and commence space much more closer to signing.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. And Mike, this is Matt. As you think about the topics that Mike just discussed, it's a natural maturing of the market. When we initially entered the large enterprise segment, we saw a little bit tighter lease-to-commencement time line. And we're starting to see that large enterprise segment mature and take a little more time in their deliberative process as they move forward. But the maturing of the market, especially in the mid-market accounts, is starting to bring that same pattern that we initially saw in the large enterprise now in multiple transactions in the mid-market as well. So we expect to be able to bring -- tighten up the spread between lease signing and commencement inside the mid-market space the same way that we initially did in the large enterprise space.","Michael F. Foust","And I think what will also continue to help that acceleration, the fact that we're doing more and more with existing customers as well. We're expanding in multiple markets, multiple continents, and those tend to be more good size, more bite-size solutions where they are commencing much more closely to lease signings. So I think we'll see that tighten as we do more and more of these expansions with existing customers.","Arthur William Stein","Mike, I'm going to add one more item to that, which is to the extent we are doing business with a customer that hasn't outsourced before, their process may not be as well defined and refined as some of the existing customers that are accustomed to outsourcing. So there can be fits and starts in this process and it could be -- and it is, frankly, a situation where the fellow with the company that's got the data center requirement's talking to our salesperson, and he is absolutely sincere that the requirement needs to be filled within a reasonably short period of time, and our customer -- and our salesperson believes that, too. But then it gets kicked around inside these companies to several different groups and several different levels. And you find that instead of 1 RFP, there might be 2 RFPs or even 3 RFPs, as the requirements go from IT to corporate real estate and back.","Michael F. Foust","But the good news is we are getting these deals signed and we have a good backlog, and that backlog is going to grow significantly over the next 1.5 years -- 1 year, 1.5 years.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stephen Douglas with Bank of America.","Stephen W. Douglas - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two, if I could. First, I'm interested in how you're thinking about the pacing of the buyback and kind of what the plan is there to balance that with the leverage? And then within the 2014 guidance, to what extent does that contemplate any buybacks? And then second, on the pricing front, I see the new disclosures on per kilowatt basis for the new leases signed. And I guess I'm wondering is there any kind of context you can put around kind of what the pricing for maybe last quarter would have looked like on that basis.","Arthur William Stein","Well, I'll answer the buyback question. There is no assumption with respect to a buyback in the outlook that we've given for next year. And as I said in my remarks, we consider the returns on our development deals, the 10% to 12% unlevered, to be superior to what the return would be in repurchasing our common stock. Now another point, quite frankly, is that we have -- basically, our capital is earmarked for our development program at this point. So our ability to repurchase common would be a function of raising alternative equity. As to the leverage, we obviously are very keen and focused on maintaining our investment-grade debt ratings. You saw on the statistics that we provided that we are in good shape in that regard. But I think if we were to embark upon a common stock repurchase program, it would be funded with either another preferred issuance or potentially a joint venture.","Michael F. Foust","And in terms of the lease rates as reflected for the per kilowatt, probably last quarter and this quarter are pretty consistent. I think we've seen pretty consistent pricing between the 2 quarters.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group, Inc.","I guess, 2 questions. I guess, first, on kind of the leasing front, if I think about the returns, Mike, that you're sort of talking about and Bill, this 10% to 12%, I guess, it's clear from kind of the way the numbers are penciling out now and the growth going forward that those returns are clearly not being achieved in kind of year 1 of these deliveries, which may have been sort of the old expectations. And I guess, I'm really trying to figure out is this a situation where year 1, these are 4% yields. Year 2, these are sort of 8% yields. And maybe by the third year of stabilization, these are hitting that 10% to 12%. Is that how we should be thinking about it?","Michael F. Foust","Well, yes, when you look at a project, typically it's going to be generally a 36-month process to reach stabilization. Sometimes it might be 40 months. So on an individual lease basis when we do our analysis lease by lease, we fully load all the costs and carry costs into that calculation on a lease-by-lease basis. And then that translates when we're stabilized on that asset, like any development project. In year 3, generally, you're going to be at stabilized or very close to, and that's where you're going to achieve your 10% to 12% unlevered returns.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group, Inc.","Okay. I think maybe part of the problem with estimates is people are giving you kind of these returns kind of day 1 when the project delivers and, clearly, it's taking kind of multiple years to get there, which I think just may be a modeling flaw. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to come back to the kind of the leasing, and you talked about the signings, but obviously, the commencements are falling short. And I guess I'm just trying to think through if a large office tenant kind of took a lot of space and somehow was phasing into it, or got free rent in effect, they would still start the lease kind of day 1 and would recognize ultimately the free rent as kind of a free rent payment. But it seems like in this case, the tenants are phasing into their space and the recognition isn't really starting until they are taking that down. And I guess I'm just trying to think what's different about this versus kind of maybe an office lease and kind of why wouldn't you be starting the leases but then have a larger free rent period?","Michael F. Foust","That's a really good question, and most of the time, what happens with these larger deployments is that because we're building pod by pod, the rent will commence on the pod that's built and being utilized by the customer. So in those cases, it phases in as they occupy pod-by-pod, as opposed to free rent, where customer is taking the entire facility and is getting free rent up front. So it's a little different nuance and the accounting treatment requires you to phase in pod-by-pod for those multi-pod customers.","Arthur William Stein","Just to add to that, Steve, so we would -- we commence upon both the tenant taking possession and Digital's obligations to the tenant in the construction process being met or fulfilled. So as Mike said, if there are multiple PODs, we need to finish the second, third, fourth POD, whatever it is, in order to commence the rent.","Michael F. Foust","And that reflects -- that phasing reflects the fact that for large customers, they just physically -- it's just physically not possible to take down and populate a multi-megawatt data center in 6 months or even a year depending on the size. It's just not feasible for anyone.","Matthew J. Miszewski","And Steve, that's part of why we made a decision to focus an increasing amount of effort on new market opportunities, because while we see the large enterprise exposure as something very positive to the long-term health of the company, we think that in the mid-market space, where the sizings for an ideal customer land is around 1 POD, it fits more directly with being able to commence within the fiscal.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So another question on underestimating the potential delays with the more complex customers. How do we know this is just a timing issue that surprised both you and perhaps the customer, versus any actual slackening of the need on the part of the tenants or at least the delay in their needs versus just the delay in implementation? So how do you know there's not some sort of temporary pause that some of your tenants are seeing in their own needs that's causing them to delay?","Michael F. Foust","That's a good question. And there's 2 -- actually 3 items that give us comfort that demand is really growing and the trend for outsourcing for both enterprises and cloud providers is growing. And first of all, one is the -- that Slide #3, that actually shows you the contractual backlog. I mean, those are signed leases that are commencing over the next short period of time. And over on top of which, new lease revenues will be added. Also on top of that are the signings and the growth in lease signings. So those represent real deals, real requirements that are moving ahead on a contractual basis. And I'd say third is our funnel of prospects that we're addressing directly today continues to grow at a pretty good clip over the last 2 quarters. So all those things give us a lot of confidence that the market for our facilities in our major markets is pretty healthy.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then lastly, regarding the straight-line rent adjustment, I guess what I'm not clear on is why was this one building ever treated any differently than the others? And how do we know there aren't more out there that could require adjustment?","Arthur William Stein","Most of our buildings are owned in feet. So this is 1 of 4 buildings where we have a leasehold and then we have another 7 ground leases. And I think what triggered this -- I mean, the reason we discovered this was that there was a cash bump in the modification in 2014. So cash rents paid didn't change from the original lease term through the initial period of this modification until 2014, which was when the original lease was scheduled to expire and then we added another 10 years to 2014 at an increased rent. So that's how it was discovered. And it's just -- we just don't have that many of them. So our team is obviously very accustomed to processing leases where we are the lessor and our customer is the lessee. Those leases, there are procedures that address that situation and the individuals in asset management, property management deal with those situations every day. This was a different situation. The procedure is still there to deal with the leasehold, but our individuals -- this is one of just a handful of situations where you would have an extension that needs to be reflected in our books and records appropriately, which it was not, and we admit that. We understand why it happened and we've taken additional steps to make sure that something like this doesn't happen again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Two leasing-related questions to start. First, do you think the delayed commencements further suggests that tenants have the advantage here in negotiating and setting the economic terms of data center leases? So that would be one. And then two, couldn't one argue here that lease signings as a data point just lost a lot of value as a leading indicator for your business? And if it's potentially a false-positive like it seemed to be in this case.","Michael F. Foust","No, I don't think so, Michael. Because if you don't have signings, you don't have future revenues. And the signings are very tangible, contractual-based cash flow that one can underwrite. So I don't think that's the case. And as we mentioned earlier, with the outsourcing being relatively new to a lot of these large customers, it's really the decision-making process and the fact that it is so important, they're entrusting critical facilities to Digital Realty, that it just has taken a longer time than our customers have contemplated and certainly than we estimated. I think we're in a much better position now to estimate and project when these leases will commence. But it certainly does not reflect a reduction at all in demand, and actually, our demand statistics and deals that we're tracking and pursuing have actually increased with Matt's group.","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes, and Mike, I think that on your question about who has the advantage on economics, we certainly do see a differential from market-to-market, and we don't see a connection between delayed commencements in the large enterprise segment and sort of tenant advantage in terms of negotiation. We haven't seen that come through in the -- in this fiscal year and we don't anticipate that coming through in 2014.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Toti with Cantor.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I hate to ask another question on lease signings, but we understand there's pretty significant pressure in the market for tenants broadly to sign new leases even when the lag in signing and commencement is long. Are you concerned that at this point you're pulling forward future demand that could result in weaker lease signings in '14 to '15?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes. So David, thanks for the question. We do see that pressure. We don't believe, given the 4 quarters looking forward pipeline, that we're looking at, that we're pulling forward deals into either Q3 or into Q4. We have a very healthy pipeline throughout the next fiscal year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then as part of that, and maybe I missed this earlier, but I'm having trouble connecting, I guess, the occupancy declines that we saw in the quarter to the sort of historically high signing. And, obviously, that's a function of the gap between the lease signings and the commencement. Do you expect that to close at some point given the sort of high volume in the quarter?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, definitely. I mean, we've seen a bit of a blip, in that we've delivered completed Turn-Key space into inventory that will be leased over the next year, as well as we had a couple of office leases in non-data center buildings that expired and we're at the very beginning now of re-leasing those in Fremont, California.","Arthur William Stein","One other thing I'd like to mention is that the 2012 third quarter same-store occupancy data included occupancy from the JV assets, which are obviously not in the Q3 2013 since we've -- those are now owned by the venture. I think in the future, we'll be adding a footnote to the disclosure to make that clear. But that was -- that contributed to the decline as well.","Michael F. Foust","Yes, those were all 100% leased buildings.","Arthur William Stein","Right.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If I may, first, in terms of the commencements and backlog, and I do appreciate the incremental disclosure on Page 3, but could you give us what the commencements number was for the quarter from a revenue perspective? And the backlog, what it is from of revenue perspective? So that way we can sort of tie it to the leasing activity and also the backlog that you provided on prior earnings calls. And then secondly, if I can sort of take us off the leasing path for a minute. I'd like to talk about your interconnected data centers and that initiative, and just give a little sense as to what the services that you're going to be providing? Are you just go to be providing dark fiber or is your intention also to deliver lit services?","Michael F. Foust","For the commencements in the quarter, we're looking at a little over $32 million of annualized GAAP rent and a backlog of almost $91 million of annualized rent.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And could you spread that out for us Mike? Last quarter, you gave us what was expected to commence for the remainder of this year and then '14 and then '15 and beyond. Can you spread that $91 million for us?","Michael F. Foust","Well, we have the actual lease rental revenue realizations that will be contributed on Page 3. We can probably provide something further on that. I don't have that table available right now, but I'm sure we could have more definition around that on kind of what the future revenue streams. Because these only reflect on Page 3 what is going to be realized in that particular year and not the long-term.","Arthur William Stein","We can give you that data at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.","Michael F. Foust","And also, Page 3 here is also NOI, it's not revenues. So we're really taking it down to the actual operating income at the property level for you in that, getting down to the bottom line. So obviously, those revenue numbers will be much larger, representing the future cash flows from each of those leases that will be commencing. You also asked about the network ecosystem, the Digital ecosystem. And that initiative is moving ahead actually quite well. We expect to have our major metros' dark fiber installed between our assets and back to the peering points, by the end of this year, January, February of next year. So we're very close to having those networks completed. And in some cases, providing lit wavelengths for customers that they can utilize as well. What this really allows us is for customers to utilize fiber themselves. It also, probably more importantly, allows the different carriers, metro and long-haul carriers, to land efficiently and effectively in our buildings to serve the customers in those buildings, and tied with the Open IX initiative, really allows all of our buildings in a metro to be connected directly with the major peering points and interconnection facilities, whether they're in a digital facility or whether they're in another location. And that's proven very effective already in customers in London, Silicon Valley and Virginia. And we expect that's going to really create more tenant demand from much wider range of customers than ever before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So first question just on pricing trends. When I do look at the pricing data for leases signed during 3Q, especially on a per square foot basis, it looks kind of lower than what we've seen historically. Just kind of curious whether that's all geographic-mix-related this quarter or was that more of a power density mix that's kind of making those numbers look somewhat lower than historical levels?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, I think if you look on a per kW basis, they're pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. I think some of it's market mix as much as anything, and the fact that some of our tenants are taking not necessarily lower power densities, though in some cases that is true. But they are taking ancillary space along with the data centers. So the per square foot number was a little bit lower because they're taking staging space, a little bit of office space and it all gets wrapped into that lease.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second thing, just when I take a look at the 2014 guidance and the capital raising activity, I'm still trying to get a sense of why the decision to try to do all the capital raising very early in the year, number one. And then number two, the whole idea of once all that's in place, leverage ratios continue to go up. You're still probably going to be below your self-imposed target, but how comfortable are you kind of moving above those targets and adding more leverage to the overall balance sheet?","Arthur William Stein","Well, the reason we're front-loading the longer-term capital, Tayo, is because we're concerned that we're in a -- that rates will go up at some point next year, that the long-term end of the curve will increase. I mean, it's come down about 50 basis points in the last month or so, and we think this is the time to strike before it goes back up. As far as the leverage ratios are concerned, so the preferred brings the leverage down clearly. The conversion of the debentures to equity, as I said, helps our debt-to-EBITDA by about 0.3. And then the growth in EBITDA as well gives us that capacity. So our forecast shows us right around 5.5x, give or take, over the course of the year. And we're comfortable managing to that. I would hesitate to commit to the equity, that we can take the leverage up until we have the appropriate discussions with the rating agencies. So I'll defer on that question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Could you give us the spreads on the re-leasing activity x Equinix?","Michael F. Foust","I don't have that x Equinix...","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","We're hearing the Equinix is a big number.","Michael F. Foust","On the Powered Base Building, they generally reflected kind of the midpoint of the Equinix. We had a couple that went down and a couple that went up in addition to the Equinix ones. But the ones that went down were not material overall.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So I'm sorry, if we pulled Equinix out, the numbers would be similar to what you reported?","Michael F. Foust","Yes, I believe so.","Arthur William Stein","Bill, let me go speak to that for one second. We do disclose the Turn-Key renewals on Page 30 of the sup and we disclosed that both on a cash and GAAP basis. And we have Turn-Key and Powered Base. Equinix is all PBB. And I think one point that I'd like to make about these Turn-Key renewals is if you take a look, the Turn-Key cash renewals are down 2.7%. But we show a rolling 12 quarters -- just on a cash basis, we show a rolling 12 quarters down 7%. So if you think about those 2 numbers, that would, to me, indicate a positive trend on lease spreads.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then sort of beat the horse one more time here on the commencements. When you sign a lease, you contractually assume there's a commencement date at some point. And it may be 1 year out or 2 years out. I guess I'm trying to get my arms around why on a very short-term basis, it would cause you to have to miss guidance in the quarter, for the quarter. I guess that's what I'm trying to get my arms around.","Michael F. Foust","Sure. So part of it is leases getting signed late in the quarter or getting signed in the next quarter. And frankly, we did not forecast conservatively enough to take into account kind of that slippage in timing. So while the signings are good -- are very good, we definitely miscalculated how quickly those deals would get signed within a quarter and if they slip from 1 quarter to the next.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hilmoe with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum, here with Gabe. Two questions. The first is what are you anticipating the incremental operating expense and G&A spend might be with regard to the expanded effort to target mid-market and smaller tenants. I mean, how much -- how many more bodies do you have to put in place to execute on that initiative?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes, so we've taken a look at the amount of increase that we would need on the sales portion of that expense. And the number of heads is roughly 1\/3 growth over where we are in the space today. So we are very wary of not trading too large a burden on our SG&A, but we do have to adjust significantly in order to meet the market.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you have a rough dollar estimate as to what that does from a dollar perspective to the payroll?","Matthew J. Miszewski","No, not yet, because we're also in the midst of a market that has -- is resetting its salary requirements. So we don't have the detailed information right now, until we get done with the -- with acquiring the asset.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the development commentary for next year, and just it sounds like the incremental dollars' best spent on development. But if I heard the earlier discussion correctly, it does sound like 2014 spend is mostly winding down the existing pipeline. I'm just trying to marry that with the very positive commentary we've been hearing all call on the signings and just the overall demand. Just why would the starts be -- why would there be limited amount of starts if that was the case?","Michael F. Foust","Well, we're in a good position of having sufficient inventory now in the major markets that we've targeted. And so we've gone through the last couple of years really ramping up our development program to meet that demand. And now going forward in 2014, 2015, 2016, we're in a really good position to lease up that space that we've been developing. And so we're ready to accommodate those customers because we have made the investment in our inventory.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the second question, just on the commencements and some of the sales initiatives that you're implementing, which sound positive. Just curious though, it sounds like the process itself is just simply more complex and that's causing things to be delayed, that's more for the larger users. So is the expected improvement in that commencement timing, is it more just the mix of the type of leases where you're getting some more of the mid- and SMB-type customers, which just naturally brings that down because they're easier deals? Or I'm just curious how the sales force really can impact that decision-making process if it's simply the complexity of the deals that are being undertaken.","Matthew J. Miszewski","I don't want to suggest that they're necessarily the easier deals, but the structure of the companies that we're targeting in the mid-market and SMB space means that there's a higher demand in those markets. So they will have -- they will be incented internally to commence quicker because there's a larger amount of external demand in their business space. And then the sizing of the individual deals makes it sort of a perfect fit for our POD architecture to be able to serve in relatively short time frame. So instead of taking out 8 megs, 10 megs of opportunity, if you're taking out an 11.25, we can roll that in relatively quick.","Arthur William Stein","I want to go back to Ross Nussbaum's question. Just to clarify on one point. So the incremental -- a substantial amount of the incremental compensation from the additional sales personnel will be capitalized in the form of leasing commission. So base salaries are relatively modest, and most of the compensation to that sales force is success-based. And that shows up as capitalized leasing commissions.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with MLV & Co.","Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Going back to leasing on your Turn-Key Flex space, the renewals, the weighted average lease term was only 2.9 years this quarter. Just wondering if we should read anything into that? Historically, it's been about 7 to 8 years. Is this just tenants renewing early and just tacking on a few years at the end of their leases, that really don't already expire for a few more years, or is the new reality is that tenants are only leasing 3 or 4 years at a time?","Arthur William Stein","I think -- well, you have 8 deals, so you just don't have that many deals. So I think that could skew it as well. If you look back on a rolling 4 quarters basis, it's 4.5 years with a larger data set.","Michael F. Foust","And you have a few colo deals in there as well that are more of a, by their nature, are shorter term when you have the colo renewals.","Arthur William Stein","That's right.","Jonathan M. Petersen - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the delay of commencements, just one more question. Just curious if you guys have the flexibility when you sign a lease and realize it's not going to commence until maybe 12 or 18 months from now, can you guys slow down the development spend on that? Or is it going to get developed at the same time anyway, and then you're just carrying it on your balance sheet until it gets occupied?","Matthew J. Miszewski","Yes, Jon, the structure of the POD 3.0 architecture does allow -- and our normal development time line does allow us to match up the actual deployments with the split of schedules as we know them. So if something is an 18-month planned rollout, we have the ability to rollout at staggard terms.","Michael F. Foust","And when you think about it too, it's not that the whole lease doesn't start for a year. You may get -- oftentimes, you'll get a portion of lease starts immediately or close to immediately, and then it phases in over 18 months. So you'll get portions commencing as you go through that 12- to 18-month time frame.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Art Massimiani with Federated Investors.","Art Massimiani","My question relates to FFO versus AFFO. Looking at the slide deck, you do a pretty good job of highlighting the new reset FFO rate. Whenever I look at the supplemental and you do adjusted FFO from there. First of all, you don't give guidance on AFFO, is that correct?","Arthur William Stein","That's right.","Art Massimiani","Okay. So if I look at it and just do a back of the envelope calculation, is the calculation for AFFO for the third quarter, would that be a good run rate, so about $0.89 a quarter kind of starting from this point?","Arthur William Stein","I think that the difficulty in providing guidance on AFFO and just using that as a starting point, relates to capitalized leasing commissions and capitalized leasing compensation, because that's going to be a function of what's signed in the quarter and what's commenced in the quarter. So I would discourage you from using the AFFO line at the very bottom of the page.","Art Massimiani","Okay. That being said, it looks -- could you then relate the lower guidance to what you guys -- how you guys are viewing the dividend going forward?","Arthur William Stein","Yes, the dividend is going to be a function of taxable income. So -- and I've said on many calls and with many investors that our dividend policy is to pay out 100% of taxable income. And the best proxy for growth and taxable income is AFFO. It's not FFO, because AFFO is cash. Having said that, we revisit our dividend level annually at the next board meeting. And we have a -- when we reported the JV, we indicated that we had a sizable taxable gain on the sale of those assets. And the IRS allows a REIT to in essence take some of the distributions made in a subsequent year and count it towards a distribution in the current year if taxable income comes in higher than might otherwise have been forecasted. So this year, our taxable income, because of the sale of assets, is higher than what we thought it was going to be when we set the dividend last year -- or earlier this year. So the implication of that is that we're going to be pulling some of our January 2014 dividend back into 2013 to satisfy the 100% distribution requirement. So having said that, what that means is that our 2014 distributions are starting out light because you can't count it twice. The only way we can meet our 2014 distribution requirement will be to raise our dividend to a level that gets us to a 100% payout of taxable income. We haven't determined exactly what that is, but that's our situation.","Operator","Next question is a follow-up question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A quick one, hopefully. On inventory, we've referenced this a number of times in terms of what's available for lease up. In some of your disclosures, obviously, occupancy disclosures by property, you referenced this. But I guess I'm trying to pinpoint a different number, which would just be total available inventory of Turn-Key versus PBB space that are available for lease up today. So completed developments. I know you point us to what's been completed in the quarter, but is there a spot in your disclosures where you have total available inventory for lease up?","Arthur William Stein","Yes, it's on Page 27 of the supplemental. At the very top line for each product type, it says, available. So for example, at the end of this quarter, we had 421,251 square feet of Turn-Key available and 161,000 square feet of PBB available. Do you see that, Jordan, on Page 27?","Jordan Sadler - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I do see that. That's perfect. And so anything -- and that obviously excludes anything in the development pipeline?","Arthur William Stein","That's just what's available today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick follow-ups. One was just can we just get a little bit more specific on the capital drag. If you think about almost $1 billion of capital raise, call it, a midsize rate when you blend preferred and the debt, you are talking about a $0.38 drag before you use that capital. So I'm just curious what you're putting in, in terms of the return on that capital, knowing that you have the $600 million to $800 million of spend and about $200 million of debt maturities. Clearly, the timing of when you do that and when you capitalize will offset some of almost the $0.40 drag of interest expense and preferred expense. So can you just be very specific in terms of what's embedded into 2014 guidance for that? And then the second question relates to this $90 million of NOI backlog. And it would be very helpful to understand what that backlog is attached to. And so there's a handful of things that are out there. You have $800 million of deliveries this year. You have a $1.1 billion current development pipeline. You have vacancy in your core portfolio. I don't know, I can't remember if it includes renewals, I believe, it doesn't. But can you sort of break out where that $90 million is attached to so that we can better understand the dynamics of what's left?","Arthur William Stein","Michael, let me handle your first question. So we are assuming that the preferred and the debt is in place for the full year 2014, for the purposes of the outlook that we gave you. We are not assuming any acquisitions. That capital is being used to retire short-term debt at basically a very low rate given where LIBOR is today. For planning purposes, we're assuming a preferred at 7.5 and a debt at 5%. So a little bit higher than what you have in mind. I mean, if you were to think of something that's a little more normalized, you might say well, maybe we would do these financings midyear rather than at the beginning of the year but then of course rates, we think, would be higher as well. I'm not sure if that addresses your question, but we're not deploying that capital incrementally into acquisitions and really, the dilution is a function of retiring short-term debt and replacing it with what we think is a more prudent capital in terms of its duration.","Michael F. Foust","And in terms of breaking out where the commencements and NOI is being delivered, it's really primarily from -- for 2014, from the product that's been delivered and is work in progress that will be delivered in the first half of the year. So that's primarily in large part from space that's built in inventory or currently under construction.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.","Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Guys, just curious on your mindset on capital allocation and your cost of capital. I think with today's share price action, this will take you certainly below your own, what I would guess is your own estimate of NAV. I'm just curious how -- even if that discount is not enough to make share buybacks attractive at this point, does it temper your enthusiasm for deploying capital into developments? Just curious how it affects your cost of capital versus capital allocation opportunity mindset?","Arthur William Stein","Well, the capital that's being deployed next year, Michael, is to finish projects that are very near completion. Some of them are physically complete, but we just need to finish the billing, and then it's to build out projects for which we have signed leases. So there's really not much discretion in that capital allocation.","Michael F. Foust","And it's going to generate, we think, still attractive returns relative to other uses of capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Schildkraut with Evercore.","Jonathan A. Schildkraut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering in terms of the backlog, are there any contractual outs for the customers that have signed up for these commitments? Are there circumstances where they can push out the start date or they can pull it forward for that matter?","Michael F. Foust","Really, there are no outs, other than in some cases if it's a build to suit, where if our development takes longer than planned then the commencement would happen later. But we don't anticipate that occurring in any cases. And so there are no outs in any of these leases.","Operator","And your last question comes from David Rodgers with Robert W. Baird.","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess, first on cost of capital, but thinking more from your customers' point of view. I know historically there's been a lot of discussion about oversupply in the market or competitive pressures out there, pricing at below market pricing. But I mean, what's been the impact since, let's say, 2009 and the financial crisis, of your customers' cost of capital getting substantially better and the impact of that on your returns versus kind of some of these other inter-market factors like new supply? And I guess, to tie into that, do you think that pressure, if in fact it's there, is abating at all?","Michael F. Foust","Well, the customers' decision to outsource data center facilities, certainly, they are looking at their cost of capital and they are realizing in many cases, if not most cases, that their investment opportunities are better investing in their own businesses rather than in the expensive data center infrastructure facilities that we specialize in. So it's really where customers set their internal hurdle rates and their internal return requirements. And I think we're seeing almost across the board, except for the Googles and Microsofts of the world, almost everyone else is saying, \"Hey, our internal hurdle rates are such that it makes sense for us to outsource.\"","David B. Rodgers - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as a second question, just to visit a topic I guess that was too often discussed earlier in the year, but with regard to obsolescence of the data space. I think a long time, your average lease term for first gen space that you delivered was about 11 years. It seems that most of the renewals that you're seeing, as you said, are somewhere between 2.5 and 4.5 years in total. That's kind of capping you out at maybe a 15-year total combined lease term, or 15 to 17. I don't know, is there any reason why there's kind of an inability to push above that on some of these second generation spaces? Can you give us any recent examples of combined first and gen -- first and second gen spaces that may be pushing beyond that hurdle to give us more confidence that there's not a big kind of capital spend in year 15 or so?","Michael F. Foust","Well, yes, certainly. I mean, there are 2 things -- I think you're looking at a pretty limited base of customers there from the Turn-Key just because of small number. If you look at combined Turn-Key and Powered Base Building renewals, those have gone out -- the Powered Base Building especially lately have gone out 10 years, 15 years. So those are -- have gone out, in many cases, very far. And what's interesting to know is that our cost on those renewals, even on the Turn-Key this past quarter, our cost per square foot was only $7 on Turn-Key and less than $2 a foot on the Powered Base Building, and -- which means, as a landlord, we're contributing very little capital. And on the Turn-Key, I can tell you, it's all leasing commissions. I mean, really none of it's going into TI or refresh, which really shows how long-lived these assets are, otherwise our customers would be asking us for a refresh capital, and that's just not happening.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Michael F. Foust","Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for taking the time today. And I want to thank our team for the hard work and everybody's attention. And I just want to emphasize the fact that our business is healthy, demand is growing and we expect to see really increased returns for our shareholders going forward here. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
