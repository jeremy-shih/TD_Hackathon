At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2016 guidance conference call. Earlier this morning we issued our Q3 earnings press release and some supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.","Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS Markit believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. Please keep in mind that the conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit's website.","After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Eric and good morning and thank you for joining us for the first official IHS Markit earnings call. We will review our Q3 results, provide you with an update on the excellent progress we've made in our integration work, and discuss some of the other highlights from the quarter.","Before we proceed with our comments today, I want to recognize and thank my IHS Markit colleagues in our offices around the world. Our merger of equals builds from combined strengths, but it is not easy and causes lots of change as we create an every better, stronger combined company. Our colleagues have embraced the integration process looking for every opportunity to improve upon the way we operate to ensure that we drive the highest level of customer delight and shareholder value. I am very proud of the colleagues of IHS who are working so well together.","Before we talk in more detail about the integration, let's speak to the high level financial results in the period which include revenue of $725 million, down slightly year-over-year on an organic basis when normalized for the timing of Boiler Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 37.1%, representing expansion of 490 basis points with core IHS margins expansion of 380 basis points year-over-year, and adjusted EPS was $0.45 up 10% over the prior year.","In terms of core industry verticals, transportation which includes our automotive, maritime, and trade and aerospace and defense teams continued to produce very strong organic growth of 9% for the quarter. Financial services organic growth, which includes our financial information, solutions, and processing businesses held steady at 3% as expected. In resources, our energy business continues to experience declining recurring revenue due to the headwinds within our markets.","However, our chemicals team continues to perform well and we're very pleased with the OPIS acquisition which is growing double-digit. CMS total organic revenue excluding the impact of Boiler Pressure Vessel Code was down 4% year-over-year due mainly to the loss of a large customer by RootMetrics due to an industry merger and the continued product rationalization within TMT.","Now let me provide more detail on our integration efforts. Lance is leading this effort, continues to be deeply involved in all aspects of the integration, planning, and execution. We've made fast and measurable progress and have a high level of confidence in our ability to deliver our synergy commitments.","As we discussed on our mid-July merger closing call, we partnered with BCG and we began integration planning back in the spring. So we were well-positioned to start executing as soon as the merger closed. Our ability to drive quick success is based upon us establishing a strong corporate culture, one that captures the best of both legacy cultures. We will succeed on this on all levels.","We've conducted an initial culture survey shortly after the merger closed with very strong participation across both companies. The results confirmed our belief that the two legacy cultures are very similar. We've introduced a new vision, mission, and values our colleagues and are building on that to further embed a strong consistent culture serving as the foundation for our future success.","Our initial cost integration efforts are focused on shared service and corporate functions where we have significant overlap. We've also taken this opportunity to fine-tune spans and layers across the organization. The completion of this work will leave us with a company that is more efficient, able to make corporate decisions, and to execute even faster. It will provide our colleagues with better visibility and access to our senior leadership levels, increasing their ability to impact our company's success.","We've also made good progress on revenue synergies. We've identified targeted financial customers for new revenue opportunities of IHS products including energy and economic country risks, and have launched sales enablement processes and training programs. It is early; however, we are encouraged by our progress to date. We look forward to providing you updates as we get further along with the integration.","Lastly, I'm very pleased to announce IHS Markit is the name to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the fourth year in a row. I am proud of our scores. We had three measurement areas that were scored in a 100 percentile of companies. The three areas are Talent Attraction and Retention, Materiality, Corporate Citizenship and Philanthropy.","We also scored in the 95 percentile for Human Capital Development. Given that we are a people-based business and that people are only sustainable competitive advantage, these scores show that we are directing our efforts and investments in the right place. My congratulations to our IHS Markit colleagues on their commitments to focus globally.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Jerre. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that IHS was the accounting acquirer [ph]. Reported results include Markit from the date of the close, July 12, so Q3 includes approximately 1.5 months of Markit.","We have included Markit's year-over-year pro forma, organic FX, and acquisition revenue for the Q3 stub period in our financial services revenue growth calculations and have included the remainder of Markit's stub period revenue as acquisitive revenue growth. We believe this is a useful way to show the true performance of the overall business. For transparency purposes, we have provided supplemental material that includes historical market organic growth on its legacy calendar year basis and on the IHS November 30th fiscal year basis.","Now for the results. Revenue was $725 million, an increase of 30% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBTIDA was $269 million, an increase of 50% and margin expansion of 490 basis points, and adjusted EPS was $0.45, an increase of 10%. Relative to revenue, we continue to see trends similar to those discussed on the last few calls. Total revenue growth was 30%. Organic revenue was down 1% for the combined company normalized for the prior year $8 million BPVC revenue. Acquisitions contributed 35% and FX was negative 2%.","The organic revenue decline of 1% includes core IHS organic of minus 2% normalized for BPVC and core market organic growth of 3% for the stub period. Recurring fixed organic was minus 1%, recurring variable organic was 3%, and non-recurring organic was minus 5% normalized for BPVC.","Looking at segment performance. Transportation growth was 17%, which included 9% organic, 9% acquisitive, and minus 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring growth and 9% non-recurring growth. We continue to see very strong growth in our automotive business and stable growth in the other transportation businesses.","We remain confident in our auto businesses' ability to continue its high single to low double revenue growth rate due to the numerous growth drivers that we discussed in our Q2 earnings call. These drivers include continued penetration and new products within the used car portion of the auto business, and within the new car portion we expect to continue to benefit from innovation around a number of key trends, including new automotive technologies, global regulatory pressure to curb fuel consumption and emissions, the increasing use of digital marketing and recall activity.","Moving on to resources, revenue declined 3%, including minus 12% organic, 10% acquisitive and minus 2% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of minus 10% recurring and minus 21% non-recurring. Our non-recurring revenue continues to be impacted by lower software sales. Energy consulting revenue was $11 million which was down $2 million versus the prior year. However, we are encouraged by the increasing level of bookings late in Q3 and near term opportunities in our pipeline.","In Q3, on a constant currency basis, our resources organic subscription base, which represents the annualized value of subscription contracts, declined $19 million and through the first three quarters, the sub bases declined 8% on a base of $700 million. The Q3 subscription-based decline was primarily from customers reducing their geographic coverage, the long tail of America\u2019s smaller independents experiencing a higher than normal cancellation rate and customers deferring to renew software maintenance.","We continue to expect to see losses in our resources sub base in Q4, albeit at a lower rate than Q3. Despite oil prices beginning to stabilize, companies continue to operate in a budget constrained environment and recent global events have caused additional market uncertainty.","As we discussed in our Q2 call, there continues to be volatility in demand requirements for oil, and earlier this month the IEA announced a slight reduction in their 2017 demand forecast. We are now forecasting the annual average price of oil in the low 50s in 2017, which is down several dollars per barrel from our prior forecast. We do believe that a more stable price environment will lead to a slight increase in capital spending budgets in 2017 primarily in the U.S.","We believe this dynamic should allow our sub base growth to be flat in 2017 and organic revenue declines to modestly improve from 2016 levels. We expect organic revenue growth to return in 2018.","CMS revenue adjusted for the negative impact of BPVC declined 6%, which included minus 4% organic, 0% acquisitive and minus 3% FX. Financial services which is comprised entirely of the legacy market business had pro forma revenue growth for this stub period of 4% including 3% organic, 5% acquisitive and negative 4% FX.","Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring fixed, 3% recurring variable and 10% non-recurring. Organic growth for the Information business was 3%. The growth in the quarter was impacted by the movement to IHS fiscal reporting as June 2015 had very strong growth due to higher levels of non-recurring revenue within our indices and pricing and reference state of businesses.","We expect improved growth in Q4 and for the fiscal year we expect to finish within our 4% to 6% long-term growth target range. Solutions growth of 6%, benefited from double-digit growth in the enterprise software and a number of our managed service businesses including tax solutions and regulatory compliance and corporate actions.","Growth in our WSO franchises slowed as loan AUMs have stabilized following healthy growth in 2015. Our processing business delivered flat organic revenue growth driven largely by strength within the loans processing business as the leverage finance and syndicated loans market was very strong.","Our derivatives processing business experienced revenue declines with lower rate volumes due to uncertainty over central bank policies. Overall for our financial services segment, we continue to expect our organic growth for the year to be 3%.","Turning now to profits and margins, Q3 adjusted EBITDA totaled $269 million, up 50% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.1% and represented margin expansion of 490 basis points. Margin expansion included core IHS expansion of 380 basis points, an additional benefit of 110 basis points from inclusion of Markit's stub period results.","Regarding segment profitability, core IHS has strong margin improvement in Q3 as we entered the year at a lower cost base due to the transition to our business line operating model and simplification and reduction of our centralized marketing, sell support and shared services cost structures.","Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $89 million with a margin of 39%, up 160 basis points versus prior year due primarily to the margin flow-through from high revenue growth.","Resources adjusted EBITDA was $94 million with the margin of 44.9%, up 300 basis points versus prior year due to segment cost reductions over the last four quarters, aligning resources to current business opportunities.","CMS adjusted EBITDA was $33 million with the margin of 25.6%, up 580 basis points last year due to cost reduction efforts and margin lift versus prior year due to BPVC in Q3, 2015. Financial services adjusted EBITDA was $65 million with a margin of 41.4%.","In the quarter, we recorded a $105 million of acquisition related expenses including $80 million of advisory and banker fees. As a reminder, when we announced the deal, we noted that the cost to achieve synergy expense reductions would be approximately 1.5 times the synergy expense amount.","Our effective GAAP tax rate was negative 44% and our adjusted tax rate was 25%. The GAAP tax rate and tax benefit was driven by the GAAP net loss in the quarter which was impacted by acquisition related costs, higher stock-based compensation and the tax efficient capital structure. The adjusted tax rate benefited from the tax efficient capital structure and declined approximately two to three percentage points versus our prior adjusted tax rate.","Q3 weighted average diluted share count for adjusted EPS was 349 million shares, which included approximately 1.5 months of market diluted weighted share count. We expect that 2016 fully weighted average share count of $319 million and the year end diluted share count to be 440 million shares. Please refer to page seven of the supplement for additional detail.","Turning to adjusted EPS, Q3 increased to $0.45 per diluted share, a $0.04 or 10% improvement over the prior year. The GAAP net loss of $32 million or EPS of negative $0.09 was primarily the result of $105 million of acquisition related costs consisting primarily of deal-related fees as well as the higher level of stock-based compensation expense.","Q3 free cash flow was $100 million and represented a conversion rate of 37%. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $467 million and represented a conversion rate of 56%. Cash flow was negatively impacted by merger-related fees paid in the quarter of approximately $60 million. Excluding these fees, the trailing 12-month conversion would have been 63%. Going forward, we are expecting free cash flow conversion in the mid-60s, excluding deal-related fees and merger related restructuring expense.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was $3.3 billion, and we closed the quarter with $201 million of cash. Our gross leverage ratio was 2.5 times and our net leverage ratio was 2.3 times. We repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares in the quarter for $157 million at an average per share price of $35.06 and expect to continue to purchase shares in the open market while continuing to operate in our targeted two to three times gross leverage ratio.","Our Board recently authorized the $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which will be used to meet our previously communicated capital return commitments in 2017. Relative to 2016 guidance, we are reiterating our previously communicated guidance with the following revisions to our stock based compensation and GAAP tax rate.","For stock based compensation, we are now expecting a range of $195 million to $205 million, which is $25 million greater than our previous range due to higher than anticipated additional expense from revaluation of market outstanding stock options and acceleration of certain share awards associated with severance activities post merger, as well as the conversion of legacy IHS PSUs caller SUs [ph].","In terms of tax rate, we are now expecting a GAAP tax rate of approximately 5%. This is lower than our previous rate due to the now higher anticipated stock compensation expense and the timing of merger-related expenses. We expect an adjusted tax rate of 25% to 26% consistent with the July call.","In terms of 2017, we plan to provide guidance in November. However, when we announced the deal in March, we provided financial expectations for the combined company including 2017 adjusted EPS growth of 20% over the midpoint of IHS' 2016 adjusted EPS guidance given on our Q1 call of this year, and a share buyback of $1 billion in each of 2017 and 2018. We are still committed to delivering to these targets.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jerre.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Todd. I am pleased with our Q3 performance given the energy industry challenges and continue to feel very positive about our leading assets and market position.","Our transportation segment continues its strong results led by our auto business performance which we believe will continue to produce strong results through market cycles, and we are comfortable with the outlook of our financial services business. Finally, we are off to a very strong start with the integration of two companies.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.","Peter Appert","Thanks, good morning. So the margin performance at legacy IHS has been very impressive. And I'm wondering Todd or Jerre, how far along in the process are we in terms of getting the benefit from these changes you've made, and I am thinking that maybe margins are going to be a little bit more difficult going into 2017 in the context of the revenue performance you're seeing?","Jerre Stead","I'll start. Peter, great question. Thank you and Todd will pick up. We are very proud of the progress we've made. The 370 basis points improvement in Q3 puts us at a record margin on EBITDA. We\u2019ve still got a lot going on and we may not see 370 basis points improvement, but we'll continue to see strong improvement as we go forward.","Also keep in mind because we will report of course the segments, so that you could see the changes as we make them. Keep in mind that part of our commitment into 2017 is the beginning of the dollars of synergy expense reduction that we'll enjoy in 2017, 2018, and then into 2019. Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. When we look at 2017, Peter, we do see continued margin levers that are available to the company. Certainly, on top of the list we talk about the synergies and initially focused on corporate insured services in those areas and really moving forward very aggressively with those and actioning that toward the latter end of Q4.","When we look at the commercial areas, a number of levers that have continued to be available relative to best cost to consolidation of data centers, we now with this deal have more data centers, more consistency in terms of the technology framework within the two companies, continued synergies in terms of or opportunities from a sales force efficiency perspective.","And then you hit on the revenue growth certainly in a lower revenue growth environment, important that we're really managing those levers very aggressively. We also -- when we look at the parts of the business that are growing at a very high level, those are areas that we have opportunity to deliver incremental margin and we made investment decisions that we'll continue to evaluate the trade-off between investment and margin delivery.","Jerre Stead","Thanks, Peter. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone.","Jerre Stead","Hi, Bill.","Bill Warmington","So I was just going to ask you to give us an update on the revenue synergies. You've talked about $100 million potential there and you've talked also about some of the buckets that would potentially would go into, three buckets in terms of some unique IHS content that you could sell into market and a couple of other buckets, and I'm particularly interested in hearing about how KY3P is progressing?","Jerre Stead","Okay, Great. Bill, thanks. I'll start, Todd can pick up again. We now get actually daily and weekly updates of the revenue that's in the pipeline that is being, as I said, focused on moving our - particularly our energy products and also our economic country risk products into the financial community and very pleased with those.","We'll see those - they're actually ahead of the plan that we put together. The $100 billion is an exit number in 19 as you know. We'll see the other two pieces pick up as we move into early 2017. Todd, you want to pick up on the last piece of this question?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. Well, as you said Jerre, the initial focus is really primarily cross-sell of IHS products into financial services, teams are driving a pipeline that we review daily. We also see opportunities, Markit products entire IHS customers, the enterprise data management, the analytics product offerings, when you ask specifically about KY3P, I mean that\u2019s a business where the Markit team continues to add customer accounts to that and we certainly see opportunity from bringing industry customers into that platform, to date that has not been a primary focus area at this stage.","Jerre Stead","Yes we are trying to get the quick thoughts.","Thanks Bill, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. I know it\u2019s early, but you didn\u2019t mention any impact of Brexit in your comments and I am specifically wondering if you\u2019ve seen any impact on Markit\u2019s business or any of your legacy IHS business as well? Thanks.","Jerre Stead","And I know, a great question Jeff. The answer is no, with one exception. Obviously the pound is down about $0.08, it is in fact I think it was under 130 yesterday. If you look at the guidance we gave at the July announcement, we were anticipating about $10 million revenue hit because of currency, it was actually about $15 million this last quarter. Other than that, no we have seen nothing that would have any impact on our business going forward. Thanks Jeff, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital markets. You may begin.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys good morning. I guess a question on the resourced business, that business the organic growth rate subscription overall deteriorated sequentially again and I guess, what are you hearing from customers, Todd? You expressed the view that you could likely see the sub space flatten out next year, I guess what gives you the confidence data, what are the prospects that you see a wide number of customers again renew for less in the key upcoming season? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","Good question Gary, Todd picked it up, I\u2019ll close it. We see the primary correlation to us is really the spending of the energy companies and the capital spending on projects. And really what we have seen in energy, we\u2019ve seen in Asia, EMEA, we have seen improvements in those markets and feel like there is a clear path to bring those into a flat sub base territory.","Americas has been more challenged, but we do see forecasts for a small uptick in spend next year, a more stable environment, companies having cycled through this for a couple of years and so, for us the key will be to really be able to move Americas into that flat territory. And we think it\u2019s not going to be a perfect market, but we think it will be improved enough and customers have made enough strategic changes at this point that they are in a lot more that they will be able to make as we move into 2017.","Jerre Stead","Only thing I would add is actually what Todd said, will give you that indication hopefully in the Q4, into Q3 our non-sub consulting pipeline was active. That will be a very good indicator for us that it\u2019s starting to ship. And then as we\u2019ve said with our bookings we will, when we see them flatten out and hopefully move positive that will be the indication that says, we\u2019re starting to move back.","We said that and Todd mentioned that looking at probably $52 a barrel next year which is down four or five from what we said last time. It is interesting as you probably saw IEA reduced $100 million barrels a day by 100,000 in their forecast and they hit the oil market by I think three bucks the next day a barrel. So, still very volatile, but the critical point is what Todd said. Yet this industry is driven by annual budgets and as we see that evolving, we\u2019ll do our best to give you the color of what we expect to see as it flattens out in 2017. Thanks Gary, next question. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah Gubbins with Bank of America. You may begin.","Sarah Gubbins","Good morning, thank you. In financial markets you recently signed PIMCO 2, your customer offering and I\u2019m wondering if that started to lead traditional buy side clients making them to move and also I believe that Markit had started to raise pricing particularly in the Information segment and I'm wondering if we should expect that to be much of a contributor to growth in 2017?","Jerre Stead","Yes, and I mean Todd, yes, please...","Todd Hyatt","On the pricing Sarah, Markit talked about a 3% price increase, it is really a muted benefit this year because many of Markit's contracts are longer term in nature. So that will really cycle in over the next couple of years. But we do see it on a long-term basis as being an opportunity to drive further market growth.","On KYC, I mean the program continues to have a number of good operational wins, so there are now 13 banks signed up on KYC and announced a strategic partnership with Dow Jones, 700 clients at the top co levels. So operationally we're happy with the progress that Michelle and team continue to make on the KYC platform. Thank you.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Sarah. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Michael Cho","Hi this is Michael Cho for Andrew. It's a question around the Engineering Workbench product, can you give us some update on if there is new sales coming on or what are you seeing for this product? Thank you.","Jerre Stead","No good question, I will start and Todd will pick up. The answer is yes, we set out 3.5 years ago to evolve a business to where we were, and ever smaller piece of our total revenue was based on royalty and that's \u2013 this is the year of the introduction of the Engineering Workbench with the new product offerings. The new product offering is early yet, but very strong and it will continue to be strong in the months and years ahead. So we feel good about that. Todd, do you want to add more?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I would add Jerre. I mean there are \u2013 there is a good pipeline. We had several good wins particularly in Q2. Q3 we didn\u2019t have the same level of activity, but we do like the way the Q4 pipeline is shaping up and for us it's about getting the customers on to the Workbench and selling them the additional products and services that Jerre talked about.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, great question, next.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may begin.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning gentlemen. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the visibility you guys have on the energy business, so you pushed the recovery out to 2018 from 2017 and maybe just going to next quarter, I think it is one of your bigger renewal quarters and maybe some color there?","And just on the non-recurring business, the software sales I guess that's understandable. What I'm trying to get at is, is that something that will come back, meaning do they have to use your product or are they finding alternate ways to use other products?","Jerre Stead","Thanks Manav. I'll start and Todd will pick up. I think two or three things, one on the software sales there is two pieces, one is the licensing and that has been postponed eventually. Customers are going to have to make the decision and will, we see early indications of that. The bigger short term return is that some of the smaller customers have actually cancelled the annual maintenance fees and that will come back and in fact the way to think about that is, those come back will end up picking a couple of years of the maintenance fees up because they can't go too long without that. So that part will come, that is a small piece of the total though. Todd, you want to pick up the...?","Todd Hyatt","As far as visibility, we do look at energy on a customer basis, so we have visibility as we look out in Q4 and on into Q1. I had said in my comments that we will see improvement in the sub-base reduction in Q4. We do see a path to move this business into a flat sub-base range in 2017, but it does continue to be a volatile and a challenging environment, but certainly our sales teams we're managing this thing at a customer level in a very granular fashion.","Jerre Stead","All right, two additional comments, one I think you all saw the 44.5% EBITDA margin on resources, our highest in history. I look forward very much to the day that the revenue turns positive which it will, particularly in upstream in the future. And when you've got that kind of margin base, we're going to see a great couple of years. I just want to clarify, we did not push out recovery into 2018. In fact what Todd said is, we're stable and expected to be flat or marginally up in 2017. Thanks Manav.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may begin.","Jeffrey Meuler","Yes thank you. On CMS how are you viewing the growth rate organically both in terms of normalized once we get past the consolidation at a RootMetrics customer and the product rationalization? So what is the normalized organic growth rate and then what is the growth rate over the next year or so, while you're facing those headwinds?","Jerre Stead","I will start and Todd will pick up. Historically the key D&D business has been 5% to 5.5%, 6% organic growth business even in downturns year-over-year, so that is a solid base. What we have gone through this year with TMT has been and we've talked about it before as we moved from 1200 products to 300 products, moved from about 35% subscription base to about 65%.","So, we look forward to seeing that improvement move into 2017. We are in the process of finishing the integration with TMT and RootMetrics, feel good about that. It was a significant 500 basis points of improvement year-over-year from a margin standpoint, not to where we want to be in total CMS, but improvement. Then finally ECR, I'm very positive about as we integrate that into the historical business and strength of the Markit business under Adam Kansler. So I feel good about those and I think we will see the progress in 2017. Todd anything?","Todd Hyatt","On the normalized, we see a normalized sub growth in CMS of 3 to 4 adjusted for RootMetrics, the all-in because of the code becomes more difficult to look through, but all in low single digit growth. Longer term as Jerre said, product design historically has been a 5% type business and we don\u2019t see any reason that, that as we get through the TMT product transformation that we can't get back to that level.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, good question. Next?","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. You may begin.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi guys, good morning, thanks for taking that.","Jerre Stead","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","I wonder if we look at the Info business, your financial services segment, given puts and takes from sort of macro and volume considerations as well as pricing moved and then also possible synergies, can you speak to what you would view as the long-term structural organic revenue growth in that business?","Jerre Stead","I will start and in Todd's script today he talked about returning to a 4% to 6% organic growth level. I think we feel very good about that at this point. Todd, you want to add?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, what I think my answer and Jeff talked about and we're certainly committed to having a business that will deliver at that level.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Ato Garrett","Hi, good morning guys.","Jerre Stead","Good morning Ato.","Ato Garrett","Just one question thinking about the business overall in terms of what the impact might be from a interest rate hike, whether that might drive a spike in process revenue is the greater trade volumes due to price changes and whether that might impact the CapEx budgets a little bit within the resourced division or even within transportation with a lot of manufacturers, can you help us just think about, if we did see a rate hike this year and possibly for the one next, where do you think the biggest puts and takes be across the business?","Jerre Stead","It's a great question, therefore Todd gets to answer.","Todd Hyatt","I think in financials, I think it would probably a net positive because probably at some level of volatility and improve overall volume levels and I think that is probably the biggest driver that we would see in financials. In the core legacy IHS businesses, I don\u2019t see a big impact from interest rates going up. I just, I don\u2019t see that a rate hike would flow through to the business in a material way.","Jerre Stead","No, I agree Todd that, especially if you think about upstream and energy because as that\u2019s gone through the cycle, the interest rate is insignificant compared to supply and demand, that\u2019s primary cost. Thank you, good question. Next?","Operator","Our next question is from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I realize you guys a little bit away from giving guidance, but I wanted to get your high level thoughts on some of the strong margin expansion that we\u2019ve been seeing particularly in resources. Todd, I think you had said that this level of margin expansion probably wouldn\u2019t continue at Q2, but we saw even stronger margins this quarter. As some of the revenue starts to stabilize or starts to grow and as you look ahead will resources margin expansion be more limited or pressured, just wanted to get your thoughts there? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","Well, I mean Peter hit on this earlier. You certainly, long term you need to have the revenue growth to continue to expand margin long term, but we have done a good job in resources of rebalancing the resourcing to the revenue levels that we have particularly in the non-subs part of the business. And I think and really from the time that the Jerre came back, well over a year ago we\u2019ve been very focused on operational efficiency. And for me probably, the primary contributor to the margin that we've been driving is tied back to the commercial operating model.","And it is this efficient aligned model that allows business leaders to make resourcing decisions with sales, marketing, product development, product management and really aligns the incentive structures around that. So, we at a corporate level we\u2019ve certainly identified the levers that are available to the business leaders and I went through those in answering Peter\u2019s call. We see continued opportunity to drive improvement in margin from those initiatives.","Jerre Stead","And the only thing I\u2019d add to that is, remember that we had committed publically to a $125 million of synergy cost savings as we go out of 2018. So, you will see a piece of that each year and that\u2019s a significant number if you think about the cost base that revolving from it.","And lastly, we\u2019ve committed that we'll continue in the legacy IHS to develop the 100 basis points improvement year-after-year and the same thing is true in Markit. So, not the 490 basis points or 370 basis points this quarter, but significant upside improvement for years to come.","When we announced the deal, we said we expected to see us evolve into, after adjustment for the accounting changes, evolve into a low to mid 40s all in way out in the future, so we\u2019re committed to that and expect to see it. Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may begin.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning. This question is for Todd. Todd, can you talk a little bit about the cash tax ex benefit for the Markit deal, what kind of cash tax rates should we expect and then over next several years, when does the company finish using the tax related benefits and which are helping the conversion ratio from EBITDA the free cash flow?","Todd Hyatt","So that the lens that we provided is that the adjusted tax rate would be in the low to mid 20s and that\u2019s what we provided at the time we did the deal. GAAP tax rate will be well below that and I talked about the reasons for that on the call. We do look at cash taxes in the near term being at the lower level than the income statement tax rate. So, what I will say is, we will provide more color on cash flow and cash conversion in November, but we certainly expect to have a cash tax level in 2017 that will be at a level that on a percentage basis is below what we\u2019ve seen in the current year.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, you talked about maintaining your earnings outlook that you originally talked about when you announced the merger, but its sounded like resources is going to take a little longer to recover. So, what should we think about as the main driver of that growth, is it margins or the buyback?","Jerre Stead","Well, there is a whole series and I\u2019ll have Todd comment on them, but let\u2019s not that - I just said our margin for resources is 44.5% historical high last quarter. So, the great job we\u2019ve done with cost control and also the commitments we\u2019ve made publically to the synergy revenue and synergy cost savings is a big piece of it. Certainly, the buyback that Todd reconfirmed today, $1.17 billion and $1.18 billion and the fact that we\u2019re currently buying will also pick up the tax piece Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, that I mean the levers that we have I think we've detailed these in the past. So we\u2019ll certainly be aggressive around the synergies, and for couple of reasons. One, financial benefit, but I think the other one is operationally, it's much better to execute and get that behind so that we can focus on running the business.","So, there is the synergy lever. There is also a more efficient cash structure from a capital perspective. There is flexibility around share buyback. And operationally we have a level of confidence that commercially we will be able to improve the underlying margins in the business, so those are really the big things.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning.","Jerre Stead","Good morning, Toni.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks, your commentary on resources is a little worse than you had previously communicated and CMS and financial services growth seem pretty light this quarter, but the guidance implies top line growth to reaccelerate organically in the fourth quarter and so I\u2019m just wondering what really the main drivers are for that reacceleration?","Jerre Stead","Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I mean I think that Q4 will be largely in line with lot of the trends we\u2019ve seen in Q3, but in terms of some of the non-subs we see some opportunity to accelerate growth in certain parts of the business in Q4. I referenced that the pipeline that we have in consulting around energy and we have opportunities there that we think provide a path to improve the overall revenue performance.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Toni. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Andre Benjamin","Hi, good morning.","Jerre Stead","Good morning.","Andre Benjamin","Yes, my question on the financial segment, I was wondering if there is any update on how the company is thinking about the anticipated shift of OTC derivatives in Europe and how you\u2019re thinking about any discussions with regulators or proactive pricing changes with the customers?","Todd Hyatt","You are talking OTC derivatives in Europe, Andre?","Andre Benjamin","Assuming I would thought.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I mean I think generally speaking, we don\u2019t see it at significant impact in 2017. We see that being a later 2017 into 2018.","Andre Benjamin","Yes, 2018.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Andre. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. You may begin.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling for Hamzah. I\u2019d a question \u2013 we have a question about the for contract renewal cycles, can you give us a sense of the resource business and how much of your overall business is in multi-year contracts?","Todd Hyatt","We don\u2019t, multi-year for resources, Jerre? I would say resources multi-year maybe 20% in dollars that's what we've talked about in the past. Markit generally has a higher level of multi-year agreements than IHS Legacy has had. Automotive we have a number of multi-year as well.","Jerre Stead","Correct, some three, four years. Thank you, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm","Yes, hey, good morning.","Jerre Stead","Good morning.","Alex Kramm","Just coming back to the financial services just for one minute, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about the third quarter and some of the reasons for the noise there, and then if you could just reiterate the four to six longer term, but can you just talk about the near term a little bit in more depth? It seems like still a lot of stress in the financial services industry, both buy side and sell side, so what should we expect in the really near term in the next couple of quarters in take? Thank you.","Todd Hyatt","Well the information, legacy information part of financial services, we continue to feel very good about. And we continue to have good solid growth in pricing and reference data in the indices area, the IBOX under management has moved up to $115 million. That fiscal year movement did have an effect of making Q2 look a bit higher than it would have been on a legacy calendar quarter basis and Q3 being lower, but that we're very confident that we will see the information service growth improving Q4 over what we saw in Q3 processing very much volume driven and we did have the improved volumes in the fixed income area in Q3.","So, I think, depending on volumes, we will see processing at or slightly below where it was. Solutions, particularly some of the enterprise software deals are very lumpy and in the world of financial services a lot of those are really timed for December. So we're certainly aware that, with the move to November year end, we may see a bit of an impact in that area as we report our Q4.","Jerre Stead","Which says Q1 will be a great start, we hope. Okay. And thank you, next question.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Boyer for closing remarks.","Eric Boyer","Just before you do this Jerre, I want to close just as a reminder to everybody, Lance and I first met on December 4th. on March 21st we announced the deal. We closed it on July 12th, fastest, this is the fourth merger vehicle I've done by far the fastest. Seven weeks later we closed the quarter, we just reported on and I am tremendously proud of the progress we've gotten 80%, 90% of the noise out of the way including all the work with BCG, et cetera. So as we move into fourth quarter and into 2017 we've got great momentum. We've got great progress going on in total and I look forward to, one the guidance we will give you in mid-November for 2017 and then reporting Q4 results in 2017. So, great job, a lot of people working very hard. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Yes, we thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Eric Boyer","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 2016 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q4 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.","Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS Markit believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit\u2019s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website.","After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Eric. Happy New Year and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. We will review our Q4 results, provide you with an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on our integration work, and discuss some of the other highlights from the quarter and the year. 2016 was a remarkable year for IHS Markit, as we merged two world-class organizations at record time. This was done while executing upon the day-to-day work of delighting our customers and delivering solid financial performance in Q4 and 2016.","Now, let\u2019s speak to the high level financial results in Q4. Revenue of $874 million, up 1% year-over-year on an organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $338 million with margins of 38.7%, representing an expansion of 510 basis points with legacy IHS margin expansion of 300 basis points year-over-year; adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 9% over last year. I\u2019m pleased with our financial performance in Q4, which included some flow through for merger-related benefits earlier than our original plan.","In terms of core industry verticals, transportation, which includes our automotive, maritime and trade, and aerospace and defense teams continued to produce very strong organic growth of 11% for the quarter. Financial services\u2019 organic growth, which includes in our financial information, solutions and processing businesses performed well with 4% organic growth. In resources, our energy business continues to experience declining annual contract value due to headwinds, primarily within the upstream energy market. However, our chemicals and OPIS teams provided strong performance. CMS total organic revenue was down 3% year-over-year.","Let me provide more detail on our integration efforts. Since the merger closed in mid July, we\u2019ve been executing against our integration plan and are very, very pleased with our progress to-date. On our November guidance call, Todd spoke to our expectation of an accelerated amount of cost synergies that we now expect to achieve in 2017. Our initial cost integration efforts are focused on areas where we have some of the most significant overlaps such as shared services, corporate functions and facilities. We\u2019ve also made good progress on revenue synergies. We\u2019ve identify targeted financial customers for cross-sell of IHS products including energy and economic country risk. As expected, these are areas in which we have had early success. We\u2019re off to a strong start and we look forward to providing you future updates.","I also want to provide a few of our business segment highlights that were accomplished in 2016. Within transportation, we had a great year of innovation-driven revenue growth in auto where we have found new ways to support our customers in areas such as recall solutions, digital marketing, vehicle compliance and performance, and technology and components analytics. We also successfully integrated CARPROOF, which extends our market leadership of vehicle history reports across North America.","Within our aerospace and defense business, we signed the largest contract in the history of that organization. In resources, we strengthened our leadership position by helping our energy customers manage through the uncertainty resolving from the worse downturn in recent history. We also successfully integrated the acquisition of OPIS, which extended our resources value chain into downstream pricing intelligence. And our chemicals business had yet another solid year with strong organic growth and a focus on margin improvement. Across financial services, there were a number of notable achievements. Within information, we continued to strengthen our indices franchise with key wins within our index administration business and ETF AUMs exceeded $100 billion.","In addition, our bond pricing business completed the major wins with the world\u2019s largest asset managers and distribution platforms. Our enterprise software business launched new hosted and managed service offerings that have short implementation time and have increased customer satisfaction. Within consolidated markets and solutions, we launched the Engineering Workbench that will drive the future strategic direction of the product design business. The TMT business, we made good progress on too with the rationalization of lower revenue non-recurring products and created larger recurring revenue product bundles. This is improving underlying cost structure and should improve revenue retention. Our ECR business completed an important migration of consolidated country risk capabilities to our Connect platform and expanded market penetration of our proprietary scenario at our Global Link Model.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Jerre. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that IHS was the accounting acquirer and as such Markit results are being consolidated in IHS\u2019s results as if it were an acquisition. Reported results for Q4 include combined IHS and Markit for the full quarter. Reported results for the full year include Markit from the date of close, July 12, so full year results include approximately 4.5 months of Markit results. We have included Markit\u2019s year-over-year organic revenue growth and FX revenue impact in our revenue growth rates for the post close stub period and have included the remainder of Markit\u2019s stub period revenue as acquisitive revenue growth. We believe this is a useful way to show the true performance of the overall business.","Now for the Q4 results. Revenue was $874 million, an increase of 57% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBTIDA was $338 million, an increase of 81% with margin for 38.7% and margin expansion of 510 basis points, and adjusted EPS was $0.48, an increase of 9%. Relative to revenue, we continued to see trends similar to those discussed throughout 2016. Total Q4 revenue growth was 57%; organic revenue growth was 1%; acquisitions contributed 60%; and FX was negative 3% headwind. The organic revenue growth of 1% includes flat legacy IHS organic growth and legacy Markit organic growth of 4%. Recurring organic growth was 1% and non-recurring organic declined 1%.","Looking at segment performance, transportation growth was 18%, which included 11% organic, 9% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring growth and 14% non-recurring growth.","We continue to see very strong growth in our automotive business and stable growth in the other transportation businesses. We remain confident in our ability to continue to drive strong growth in the autos business due to the numerous growth drivers that we have discussed on prior calls, including continued penetration of new products within the used car portion of our auto business. And within the new car portion of our auto business, we expect to benefit from continued innovation around a number of key trends including a large number of new automotive technologies, global regulatory pressure to curb fuel consumption and emissions, and the increasing use of digital marketing and recall activity.","Moving on to resources, revenue declined 1% including minus 9% organic, 10% acquisitive, and minus 2% FX. The organic revenue decline was comprised of minus 10% recurring and minus 3% non-recurring. Our consulting revenue was flat versus prior year. In Q4, on a constant currency basis, our resources to annualized contract value or ACV, which represents the annualized value of recurring revenue contracts, declined approximately $11 million, which was an improvement compared to prior quarters. For the full year, the organic ACV decline was approximately 10% and the year-end FX adjusted ACV was $620 million, excluding the OPIS.","As previously stated, we expect continued ACV pressure in Q1 due to several multiyear agreements that will have some renewal pressure in the period. For the full year, we continue to expect our ACV to be flat. We are now forecasting the annual average price of oil to be in the high 50s in 2017. This more stable price environment will lead to more favorable capital spending budgets in 2017 than we have experienced over the past two years. This dynamic should allow our organic revenue growth declines to modestly improve from 2016 levels and we expect organic revenue growth to return in 2018.","CMS declined 6%, which included minus 3% organic and minus 3% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of 1% recurring growth and minus 20% non-recurring growth. CMS was impacted by the loss of the significant customer contract in our RootMetrics business and the continued product rationalization within our TMT business. Our product design business continues to growth in the low to mid single-digit range.","Financial services revenue growth was 1% including organic revenue of 4%, 1% acquisitive and negative 4% FX.","Organic revenue growth was comprised of 2% recurring fixed, 11% recurring variable, and minus 15% non-recurring. Information organic growth of 4% was an improvement on the 3% revenue -- organic revenue growth delivered in Q3. Our indices business delivered double-digit organic revenue growth as ETF AUMs remain robust and our index administration business performed well.","In addition, our bond pricing business completed some major wins. Our processing business delivered 9% organic revenue growth; this was largely driven by the loans processing business as the leverage financing and syndicated loans markets were strong. Derivatives processing had negative organic revenue growth due to lower credit volumes but did see higher rates volumes in the quarter due to increased Markit activity. Solutions revenue was flat year-over-year impacted by negative organic revenue growth within the enterprise software due to a strong prior year comparison following a recognition of non-recurring software license sales.","Our managed service businesses had a solid quarter with double-digit growth within our digital and regulatory compliance products. Solutions organic revenue growth is expected to improve in Q1 due to improved levels of non-recurring software license revenue.","Turning now to profits and margins, Q4 adjusted EBITDA totaled $338 million, up 81% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.7% and represented margin expansion of 510 basis points. Margin expansion benefitted from legacy IHS expansion of 300 basis points, and the inclusion of Markit results.","Regarding segment profitability, legacy IHS had strong margin improvement in Q4 as we entered the year at a lower cost base due to the transition to our business line operating model and simplification and reduction of our centralized marketing, sell support and shared services cost structures.","Transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $101 million with a margin of 42.8%, up 320 basis points versus last year due primarily to margin flow-through from high revenue growth.","Resources adjusted EBITDA was $92 million with the margin of 43.3%, up 110 basis points versus last year due primarily to segment cost reductions over the last four quarters, aligning resources to current business opportunities.","CMS adjusted EBITDA was $36 million with the margin of 27%, up 300 basis points versus last year. Financial services adjusted EBITDA was $125 million with margin of 42.9%.","In the quarter, we recorded $41 million of acquisition related expense. Full year 2016, we have incurred approximately $161 million acquisition related costs of which $90 million related to advisory and banker fees from the merger and $60 million related to cost to achieve merger synergy targets, including employee related severance and retention and contract termination costs, primarily related to our facilities consolidation initiatives.","Stock-based compensation expense was $61 million, our effective GAAP tax rate was minus 7% and our adjusted tax rate was 24%. And turning to adjusted EPS. Q4 increased to $0.48 per diluted share, a $0.04 or 9% improvement over the prior year.","Q4 free cash flow was $115 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $491 million and represented a conversion rate of 50%. Cash flow for the year was negatively impacted by restructuring and acquisition related costs paid in year of approximately $140 million. Excluding these costs, conversion would have been approximately 64%, in line with our long-term objective of the mid-60s.","Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end debt balance was $3.4 billion, which represented gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.5 times and a net leverage ratio of 2.4 times, and we closed the quarter with $139 million of cash. In the quarter, share repurchases were $341 million or 9.4 million shares, an average price of $36.28. Additionally, we completed the Markit initiated ASR from December 2015, receiving 1.1 million shares.","Our Q4 diluted weighted average share count was 432.9 million shares and our full year diluted weighted average share count was 316.3 million shares. Our year-end fully diluted share count was approximately 430 million shares. As discussed on our 2017 guidance call, we are planning to execute $1.2 billion of share buybacks in 2017. Relative to our buyback strategy, we executed a $250 million ASR effective December 1, 2016. In addition to the ASR, we plan to repurchase $200 million of shares in the open market during Q1. We expect to use a combination of ASRs and open-market share repurchases throughout 2017 to execute against our full year repurchase target.","Moving to full year financial results. Total full year pro forma revenue for the combined Company was $3.451 billion, which represented growth of 5% including 1% organic growth, 6% acquisitive and minus 2% FX. In terms of reported financial results, which include 12 months of legacy IHS and approximately 4.5 months of legacy Markit, revenue was $2.735 billion, which represented 25% all-in revenue growth including flat organic growth, 27% acquisitive and minus 2% FX.","Revenue growth for the transportation segment was 18%, which included 10% organic, 8% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. Revenue for the resources segment declined 3% including minus 9% organic, 8% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. Revenue for the CMS segment declined 2% including minus 2% organic, 2% acquisitive and minus 2% FX. And revenue growth for the financial services segment for the stub period was 2% including 4% organic, 2% acquisitive and minus 4% FX. Pro forma organic revenue growth for the full year for the financial services segment was 3% including organic growth of 5% for information, 4% for solutions and minus 1% for processing.","Turning now to reported profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $988 million, up 42% versus year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.1% and represented margin expansion of 420 basis points. Margin benefitted from legacy IHS expansion of 300 basis points and the inclusion of Markit results. Stock-based compensation expense was $204 million and included additional expense from revaluation of Markit outstanding grants and acceleration of certain share awards associated with severance activities post-merger as well as conversion of ISH [ph] PSUs to RSUs. These items will continue to impact stock-based comp expense into 2017 as the accounting for stock-based comp amortizes expense over the life of the equity investing period.","In terms of actual share issuance activity, we expect to issue 5.5 million RSUs and PSUs in 2017, which at the current share price equates to stock-based compensation grants of approximately $200 million, which will be amortized over the vesting period of the awards, generally three years. In 2018, we\u2019ve planned to reduce RSU and PSU issuance to 4 million shares which at the current share price would equal stock-based compensation grants of approximately $150 million.","In terms of taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate was minus 4% and our adjusted tax rate was 26%. The negative GAAP tax rate was driven by impacts from the merger of tax benefits related to merger costs, acquired tangible assets and the merger capital structure. Most of these impacts were excluded from our adjusted tax rate. The adjusted rate did benefit from the merger of capital structure. Finally, adjusted EPS was $1.80 per diluted share, an increase of $0.20 or 13%.","We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance which we provided on our November 14th guidance call. In terms of highlights, this guidance provides for revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.56 billion. This represents 2% to 4% organic revenue growth, negative FX impact of approximately $50 million, and acquisitive revenue of slightly less than $20 million from the CARPROOF and OPIS acquisitions; adjusted EBITDA of $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion, which represents margin of 39.4% at the midpoint and adjusted EPS of $2.02 to $2.08.","Just to remind and help you with modeling, CERAWeek has moved from Q1 in 2016 to Q2 in 2017 and the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code will be in our second half results this year. Prior year\u2019s CERAWeek revenue was approximately $15 million at relatively high incremental contribution margin. Boiler Code revenue is approximately $10 million and is relatively low margin.","As discussed at the time of the merger announcement, IHS Markit is well-positioned to drive attractive shareholder returns given our financial scale, substantial cash generation, return on capital strategy and revenue expense and tax synergy opportunities. This combination creates a very attractive financial lens.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jerre.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Todd. I\u2019d like to thank all our colleagues who have worked tirelessly over the past year in getting us to this point where we hit the ground running in December, the start of our very first fiscal year as a new company. Moving forward, we expect to benefit from improved energy markets and are focused on investing to grow the top line of our businesses to provide continued shareholder value-creation. We look forward to further discussing our strategies for IHS Markit\u2019s exciting future at our Investor Day on April 26, in New York City.","And now, Todd and I are ready to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. The margin performance continues to be very impressive, Jerre. I\u2019m wondering is it possible to break out for the fourth quarter the year-to-year improvement? How much is a function of the initiatives? They\u2019ve been in place for a while versus the early flow-through from synergies. And then related to this, I\u2019m just as always interested in your confidence and the sustainability of margin improvement from a fundamental perspective, given how much you\u2019ve done already?","Jerre Stead","Yes. No, we\u2019re backwards, Peter. Thank you. I\u2019ll have Todd answer the first part of your question in a minute. High degree of confidence; when we announced this on March 21st, we said we expected over time to get ourselves to the mid 40s margins. If you look, we actually have three of our four business segments at 43% this quarter. So, we are making great progress, and I have a very high degree of confidence of that including ongoing productivity. As you know, the business model works so well and as we see organic growth in the future increase, we are going to see those margins continue to increase after all the synergies are in place by 100 basis points or more. Todd, do you just want to talk about the breakout?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. Peter, I think in terms of the initiatives that were in place, I mean legacy IHS has driven this 250 to 300 points throughout the year. As we have closed the merger earlier than we originally anticipated, we certainly got ahead of some of the initiatives relative to the merger cost opportunities. So, I think in rough numbers, I\u2019d probably attribute somewhere on the order of $5 million to $10 million related to that early start gave us couple of cents, several cents in the EPS line, and Jerre referred to this, certainly helped in terms of the over performance. Importantly, as we entered the year, the commercial guys, very focused on continuing to drive margin in this 100-point range and then that coupled with the additional synergies that we\u2019ve talked about from the deal, I think provided clear path to drive to the level of margin expansion that we talked about for 2017.","Jerre Stead","Just one quick wrap up on that. I\u2019m very proud of all of the business leaders and all of the support service leaders. We\u2019ve made great progress, continue to be ever more productive. Thanks, Peter. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","First question, just the resources, or two part question I should say, the resources bookings trend. Can you give us an update on how things have gone in the key yearend selling season? And Todd, if I heard you right, you alluded to still some renewals that you expected to be a bit worse in this season. Did I hear that right? And then just a last piece of that, what is the IHS in-house energy research team; how are they thinking about E&P company CapEx for 2017? We\u2019ve seen a lot of idea -- obviously that\u2019s a key leading indicator in a lot of forecasts for -- all over the map, what\u2019s your view? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","So, the sub base in Q4 was down $11 million. I talked about Q1; we do have a handful of really call the last of multi-years. So, in general, multi-year is not a huge percent of energy, but it\u2019s probably 25% to 30% of the contracts. So, we\u2019re really cycling the rest of those in Q1. And we know that there will be some pressure in Q1, probably order of magnitude, think of it in the context of what we saw around Q4. As we look ahead and we really do look at account at a relatively granular level, we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at for the remainder of the year, as we look at the large accounts and really the cycling of those. And we are seeing some easing in the pressure at the tail, sort of the reductions, small levels of reductions but end up becoming a relatively large number.","So, looking ahead to Q2, we feel like we\u2019re well-positioned to drive to the flat level and then accelerate from there. As far as CapEx, probably the big change as we last talk about it is we do see increasing spending in North America and the U.S. So, we see capital spending levels there, certainly well in the double-digits in terms of percent increase. Rest of the world, our experts still see, I think a relatively flattish capital spend for 2017.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","I just want to start with a comment, which was to congratulate you on the year-over-year organic revenue growth improvement in all four divisions; that\u2019s unusual to see. So, the question is whether you\u2019re seeing any -- actually two-part question. The first is on the synergy targets for 2017 in terms of the costs and revenue. We have talked in the past about $35 million for costs and $15 million for revenue; your thoughts on how that\u2019s tracking? And then the second part is whether you\u2019re seeing any change in demand from clients for the KYC and KY3P based on the discussions around reduced regulation or financial services?","Jerre Stead ","Thanks Bill. Todd, pick up on the last part and then I\u2019ll pick up on the organic growth.","Todd Hyatt","I think on KY3P piece, we continue to see good traction in that and I think importantly really good commercial relationships with important financial partners in that area. But that\u2019s not going to be a net positive contributor for several years. But it is an area that we\u2019re investing in. And I think we do see an opportunity for that business longer term. I think KYC is a platform that we continue to evaluate opportunities to scale that platform. Once again, we don\u2019t we see that being a near-term contributor to the financial results.","Jerre Stead","I\u2019ll pick up from there. In fact, you and I talked about that very that very thing on the way over this morning. To the first part of your question, Bill, just for clarification, we actually gave guidance of $10 million of synergy revenues in 2017. We feel very good about that at this point; we track -- actually I give a report daily. We\u2019re seeing good traction, particularly as we sell historical IHS products into the financial markets just with great account management participation. And we\u2019re starting to see flow-through of Markit products into the IHS businesses, so we feel good about that. We feel very good about the synergies from a cost standpoint, as I mentioned earlier. Couldn\u2019t be more pleased, the effort that everybody has done that led by Lance doing integration work and supported by the rest of us is very much on target. And the guidance, the question was asked when we gave the guidance we were at $35 million or better. Todd gave a range and I think that applies now that we\u2019re north of the $35 million, probably up to $45 to $50 million in 2017. So, we feel very good about that. And then finally on the organic growth, just one thing I\u2019d remind everybody of, make sure you pick up on what Todd said. We actually have $50 million negative headwind on currency in 2017. So, despite that, I think we\u2019re quite positive today across the board of seeing that midpoint of the guidance that we\u2019ve given for organic growth. Thanks Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. You gave us some data about retention in your resources division. I was wondering if we can get some similar anecdotal data about retention in your other three major divisions. Thanks.","Jerre Stead","Please put him back on operator. Let me make sure what question on retention, which part of retention are you referring to? Can you put him back on operator, please? Okay. I\u2019ll assume then that you\u2019re talking about our renewal rates. And the renewal rates are very high with our thousand largest customers in the high 90%, in fact even including the resources business. And the recurring business and our financial services business is equally high. So, we feel very good about that. Retention rates of customers is high, very high. And you\u2019re right, Todd said we\u2019re seeing the resources at the end of the chain, the tail if you will of the smaller one, that too stabilizing. Sorry, if I misunderstood the question. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Jerre. Could you go over in more detail the revenue dynamics around fourth quarter solutions, which major products are growing, which are dragging, and then be more specific about that tough software comp you talk about year ago?","Jerre Stead","Yes. We\u2019ll have Todd pick up on that.","Todd Hyatt","So, Andrew, I think we saw in the solutions area and continue to see that the Markit On Demand product performed very well, CTI Tax performed very well, Counterparty Manager, so the regulatory compliance products, I think there were -- the WSO software, good grower. There were some tough comps in some of the software products, so tougher comp on EDM and analytics. EDM was still a grower; analytics had a really difficult comp, so a bit of a drag there. We did feel good about the sales in December and we do expect to see improvement in that solutions growth rate in Q1, which I referenced on the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","Just follow-up on that. The financial market solutions segment, just remind us roughly, how much of that revenue is non-recurring or license and on the recurring piece, how is client retention and how has it been trending?","Todd Hyatt","We don\u2019t report on the recurring, non-recurring in this legacy sub segment. I mean, we\u2019ve always looked at it in legacy Markit in an aggregate manner. Just to provide a bit of color, I would say that the split is probably 60-40\u2026 ","Jerre Stead","55-40.","Todd Hyatt","55-40, somewhere in there. And I think the customer retention continues to be very strong in the items that are -- the renewal or the continuing software service like the WSO area, the Markit On Demand area.","Jerre Stead","I\u2019d just add to that. One of the great things with the businesses we\u2019ve merged them is indeed that renewal or retention of customers, we provide really critical products, must have products that are very sticky and help our customers in every way. So that\u2019s a great strength of our business. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","First, just two parts, one is just basic one. Todd, the $620 million FX adjusted CV, I guess what is the FX hit to that number, just trying to see if we have the right comparables? And then, if you could just help us understand in the non-subscription piece of your auto and energy businesses, like what is the mix of the different non-recurring pieces in there, just to help us try and understand what the potential for recovery that would be especially on the energy side as things improve?","Jerre Stead","Thanks, Manav. Do you want to pick up the first part?","Todd Hyatt","Can you go through the second part of that question, Manav?","Jerre Stead","I\u2019ve got it.","Todd Hyatt","Okay. So, the FX in year on the $620 million was $10 million? And that was it. ","Jerre Stead","So, non-subs, Manav, on auto, a significant portion of that is on recall that has done well and will continue to. The recalls is a good piece of that and then one-off projects also are strong, as Todd mentioned and continue to be. Your question on energy, upstream if you will, is a very good one. If you think about it being an early indicator, Todd said on script that the consulting was flat year-over-year, very good indication of what\u2019s coming and we expect to continue to track there. That\u2019s by far the biggest piece of the non-subscription base in energy. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Just at a high level, reaffirmed 2017, which looks great, but it seems like energy is coming in a little bit stronger, the synergies are clearly coming stronger. Are we just being conservative with the 2017 reaffirm or is the offset the higher FX?","Jerre Stead","I\u2019m curious to hear Todd\u2019s answer on that myself.","Todd Hyatt","We feel like we\u2019re well-positioned as we enter the year. But you always have work to do, but we feel like we have the levers available to us to deliver. We are encouraged with some of the things that we saw in the quarter. I think we saw a generally improving level in financials, and it is where we need to get to on energy. But we have a lot of work to do for the year. So, we feel like we\u2019re positioned the way we need.","Jerre Stead","Yes. And I agree with that, kidding aside very much. This is the beginning of my 38th year as CEO of public companies. I would tell you, I have high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver that guidance. And we always want to be balanced and have the opportunity to outperform as we go forward. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","The transportation performance has been really pretty impressive and consistently so. I wondered if you can talk a little bit about how much of that is sort of intrinsic demand driven or same-store sales versus new products. And kind of as a corollary, what\u2019s the pipeline for new products like in that segment and how long does the cycle run in your mind for new solution introduction?","Jerre Stead","Great question. Todd, pick up on it, because it\u2019s important one.","Todd Hyatt","Well, I mean, I think you can look at used and new. And in used, what Dick and team have done is we have this great asset and the vehicle history report that we continue to drive additional market opportunity and product off of that. So that\u2019s where you look at used car listings, you look at valuation, you really look at the one-time to life-time strategy that team has built on. But even in the core business, we continue to see opportunity to grow the core business through different markets, the business insurance area has been a strong market. We do continue to drive advantage into independent dealers and that creates opportunity for revenue uplift. And importantly, I think the market positioning that that asset has allows it to drive revenue in different ways with new products into the future. So, we remain very optimistic about that business.","When you look at the new car area, I think that Edward and team have been very good at creating new products. The recall has been good, but we\u2019ve built additional functionality around the recall offering that\u2019s created more wallet share. Digital continues to be very strong and autos. We talked about the new O2 emissions, analytic product that\u2019s been very strong. And that theme is very connected to their customers and I think they consistently are looking at opportunities to build new product offerings into the market, based on the customer requirement. So, we feel like it\u2019s a strong market but we\u2019re well-positioned at managing that well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","I just want to come back to the margin question at the beginning and drill in particular into the resources segment. I think the margin was down quarter-over-quarter for the first time this year. So, just wondering A, can you remind us of the seasonality a little bit and then maybe give us little bit more color on next year? I know, you\u2019re looking for further improvement, but I know the first quarter is going to be challenging again, then maybe a recovery. So, maybe talk about the trajectory of the margins a little bit more, Todd. That would be helpful. Thank you.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean, I think resources, given the revenue pressure through the year, the fact that we were able to grow margin consistently was a strong story. And that was driven -- there is some portion of cost that gets allocated to all the business line, that\u2019s probably about a third and then two thirds for the cost, to direct cost. So, it\u2019s a benefit of overall lower allocated costs but also resources did align the cost structure to the reality of the commercial opportunities. I think as we look ahead to next year, long-term it\u2019s hard to drive margin expansion without the revenue topline. We will see as we go through the year, improvement in the organic revenue decline trajectory in resources. And I think that will allow us to maintain a margin in that low to mid-40 range. But it won\u2019t be a margin acceleration year for resources in 2017.","Jerre Stead","And as the revenue comes back\u2026","Todd Hyatt","Then, we\u2019ll start to see the margin, but I wouldn\u2019t think of this accelerating margin for resources in 2017. ","Jerre Stead","Agreed. And then the other thing that\u2019s the beauty of our business in total at HIS Markit is that when we get that kind of organic growth, it becomes wonderful free cash flow machine with negative working capital that we\u2019ll see happen in the future. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hey, Jerre, I have one two-part question because that seems to be the way to get through your one question filter.","Jerre Stead","Yes. I\u2019m going to have to ban the three parts.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Can you just -- the first part is can you just give a little bit more detail on the products that are doing well on a cross-sell from both IHS into Markit and Markit into HIS? And then, as a second part, just maybe this is for Todd. How does the change in oil prices that we\u2019ve seen more recently impact the thought of ACV improvements or the kind of troughing in resources as we go through the year? Do we have like kind of an improvement kind of coming in a little earlier; if you can go through both of those two parts to the same question?","Jerre Stead","Yes, I\u2019ll pick up the last part actually and have Todd pick up the first part. Our current guidance actually just released last Friday by our energy experts is the high $57, $58 a barrel in 2017, which is up obviously and an improvement. We have said consistently that\u2019s being stable is what\u2019s critical. There is actually interesting articles including one today, I believe it was in the Wall Street Journal about when you get above $55 a barrel, particularly with a lot of the shale, but that slips into the profitability standpoint. And they have made great productivity improvements over that time. So that\u2019s the good news. The more important thing though is what is driving capital and a capital increase. As Todd said on at the beginning, what we see is the capital spending up in north -- in the U.S. specifically, also Mexico; other parts of the world still pretty flat with some increase. But at fields like we are at the point -- your question is a good one, the trough. Todd gave you thoughts on where we\u2019ll be in the Q1; he also said that we would in the year flat to up. So I think that feels is as good as we can get. Todd, do you want to pick up the other part?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I think on the cross-sell, certainly the most -- the one that jumps out is really deeper penetration of IHS products, energy, chemicals, transport into financial end markets. And Markit has a great account manager program and their job is to grow dollar share in accounts by selling products and services or identifying opportunities to sell products and services across IHS Markit into existing customers. So, I think there, you\u2019re looking at Vantage, Performance Evaluator, legacy Herold, [ph] the M&A tracking, some of the energy chemicals, inside information. And we really do see a pre-OPIS, the pricing data, we see a very robust pipeline. And then I think ECR, the Economic Country risk.","In the other direction, items that are probably a longer build in terms of sales -- longer sales cycle, but we do see opportunity or some of the valuation products to be sold into energy customers. And also the electronic data management we think is a product that can certainly be sold, outside financials into some of these larger industrial customers. So, those are the areas that we really have teams focusing on right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anjaneya Singh","Just building on the prior question actually, Jerre, could you speak a bit more to some of the early successes that you guys are having on the revenue synergy front? Just hoping for some thoughts on what you\u2019d attribute those early successes to; are you finding these customers to be relatively white space for you guys; is it your push effort; are you doing any special discounting here to gain a foothold? And then for Todd, how far are some of these new products you just mentioned from fruition?","Jerre Stead","I\u2019ll actually answer both. The new products Todd is talking about are in place and will continue to be. Great question. Here is a way to think about it. We have started, we -- historical IHS investing with new products and each being critical one to bring us to the financial community world of what we can provide to help them make the right investment decisions on an energy standpoint. The products that Todd just mentioned a minute ago were existing products. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the progress we\u2019ve made on those. When I was in Asia few weeks ago with Shane and Lance, we were privileged to see and book the largest Vantage order we have made in the history of the Company.","So, the reason we\u2019re getting the quick wins is they were products that we made large investments in at HIS, including the ones that Todd talked about at ECR too that now shift with really outstanding account management organizations that would have taken us, I think years to accomplish on our own at IHS, so, existing products, selling into financial communities with great account management leadership. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Chu","Good morning. I know it\u2019s a little bit early, but any thoughts on the potential around deregulation in financial services? So, just trying to get a sense if maybe that\u2019s a net positive as trading volumes improve or a net negative as there is just lower regulatory related revenue?","Jerre Stead","That\u2019s one we talk a lot about. Go ahead, Todd, because it\u2019s a great question.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I think it\u2019s probably a net positive. I think healthier, more robust end market is typically a good thing. It could for a product build like a KYC, it could make that more challenging if that becomes less of a focus. But as I said, we don\u2019t really see that as being a contributor in the near-term. But in general, I think I would take healthier end markets.","Jerre Stead","Very much agreed. I\u2019d only add to that, there is a lot of optimism in the financial community today as there is in the energy community with all of the programs that President-elect Trump has talked about. I think we all need to remember, there is a lot that has to be accomplished with legislature before those actually play out. So, I think from 2017, it is positive, but I think it\u2019s in the future, we\u2019ll see if they play out and how well they do. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. ","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the legacy financial services business a bit. How is the move to electronic trading in Europe impacting results, any way to quantify the positives in that business versus the headwinds? And can you talk about the loss of the client? I think you said there was one in CMS.","Todd Hyatt","We don\u2019t see an impact on the electronification in Europe. I mean, I think that\u2019s going to be further out. So, we don\u2019t really see an impact in 2017. RootMetrics, I think we talked about this on Q3, we did lose a customer end of Q2 and that has weighed on the CMS segment, that\u2019s really bad plus this reduction, planned reduction in non-subs as we move a lot of what were previously sold as reports to larger subscription products. I think that has created a drag in CMS for the entire year. Strategically, it positions us well. We will have a growing subscription product in CMS or in technology as we look ahead. And I think importantly in that segment is the core product design business, the engineering work bench continuing to perform in this 3%, 4%, 5% growth range. The other piece of that business is ECR. And I think ECR in general should see some level of improvement in 2017. I think just in general, a more active set of markets is a positive thing for that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","In the legacy Markit, organic business, the organic growth has been about sub 5% for the last six quarters. Are there any secular trends that you would call out there or do you view it as all cyclical? Solutions has been at a lower level; you explained the drivers for that earlier in the quarter, but info also has been sort of toward the lower end of its historic range. And so, just wondering about those trends and then basically when you expect the businesses to improve, and is 5% to 7% still the right long term target or have you reset that a little bit lower?","Todd Hyatt","No, that\u2019s fine Toni, please to. Yes, importantly, the information business within the legacy Markit continues to be a very consistent 5% and the franchise, the loan franchise, the pricing reference data franchise, I think the growth we see in bonds, all very positive signs. When we talk cyclical secular, I think the thing that Jeff and Lance would talk about is really the processing business, I think Markit, very transparent relative to processing and the impacts the processing had on growth rates in 2015-2016. We saw processing volumes starting to pick up a bit, we\u2019ve seen going back to Q3 some improvements there and I think little bit more stability in process. And I think solutions, continue to have the right strategy in solutions. And you see some volatility around some of the software that I talked about on this call. But I think the other thing I talked about is in general, I do think that improving financial markets would be a net positive to the portfolio.","Jerre Stead","And to wrap up on your question, Toni, I think we actually talked about it recently, I think the 5 to 7, mid to long-term organic growth is the right number for us as we go with forward planning. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andre Benjamin","I just want to go quickly back to the transportation business. One, you talk a lot about new products that are penetrating, but just wonder how much the growth outlook would be just tied to the underlying auto sales growth and what that will look like if sales were flat in the U.S. and then where you stand in the process of generating more transport revenue, internationally?","Jerre Stead","So, I\u2019ll start and Todd can pick up. As we said, 60% of that revenue is used car. Used car business actually accelerates if new car goes down, has historically. We are stronger than ever before now with the merger of the business we acquired last year and giving us great strength in North America. So, feel good about that. On the global business, Todd, do you want to pick up on that, because we really don\u2019t see an impact on the overall car sales versus our business?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s just a smaller part of the portfolio. But we continued to look at growth drivers. I mean for example in car bags, we continue to have handful of countries that were operating and it\u2019s relatively small I think. Polk has a good business in Europe and certainly a growing business in Europe, but it\u2019s just a smaller part of the portfolio. In general, we don\u2019t see anything that will prevent us from continuing to grow outside of North America. I think on the question of really SARs [ph] and car sale volumes, if you think about used cars, as Jerre said, no impact on it, actually probably countercyclical. If you look at what we do, we really help dealers manage their sales marketing channels and significant investment made in those. And regardless of how many cars are being sold, you still need to drive brand loyalty, still need to drive conquest. These things are still very important. So, I consistently say for us healthy end markets, I mean we don\u2019t want end markets that are declining and huge cost cuts, but in general I think what we need is a healthy market to be successful and grow our business.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to get updated view on the current sales force structure as it currently stands and particularly, how much of an opportunity there remains on productivity. Given the legacy IHS had been moving towards an inside sales model, you guys had been pushing potentially higher quota levels. And so, just trying to get a sense post-merger where you guys stand on that and where the opportunity is. Thanks.","Jerre Stead","A great question to wrap up, very pleased with the shifts we\u2019ve made in the legacy IHS business to having all the sales organization report into the businesses, 1.2, our target on inside sales historically has been it as much as 80% of the customers, which would be about 18% of the revenue on inside sales. We started that work with the Markit businesses and feel very good about what we can do over time with inside sales there too. Todd has the sales operations reporting to him, and I\u2019ll have him wrap up on this question, because it\u2019s an important one. And I\u2019m very pleased with the progress in total.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I think the longer term opportunity, IHS -- legacy HIS, very focused on the inside sales, still more we can do there. I do think that\u2019s an opportunity within legacy Markit. I think legacy Markit has a great account management program. And they have really structure where they have sales specialists that support sales to -- relative to specific products, but they also have an overlay of account mangers. And that provides a great footprint to drive cross-sell of products across both companies. And we think that it\u2019s a program that IHS had at a much smaller level. We think that does present an opportunity longer term.","Jerre Stead","I think that\u2019s a great one to think about where we\u2019re learning from each other to really improve the total in the years ahead. So, thank you very much. Eric will wrap it up in just a second. We go into 2017 with amazing accomplishments in 2016. I\u2019m very pleased with the progress across the board and look forward to reporting Q1\u2019s results on March 28th and particularly look forward to April 26 when we\u2019ll layout a full strategy of where we\u2019re at, where we\u2019re going to go in the future. Lance and I\u2019ve been working on that, actually have sent that out to our Board, gotten great response on that and we\u2019re excited about sharing it with you on April 26.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.","Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited.","This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website.","After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance. Lance?","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We are pleased with our Q1 results as we outperformed our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to invest in our people, our products, technology and customers for long-term profitable growth. Key financial highlights of the quarter: revenue of $932 million, up 10% year-over-year and 6% on an organic basis and at the upper end of our longer-term range.","We experienced broad-based growth across the firm. Adjusted EBITDA of $359 million and margin of 38.6%. Normalized margin expansion was 220 basis points, excluding the impact of FX and automotiveMastermind. And adjusted EPS of $0.53, up 18% over the prior year.","Let me now provide some segment highlights. Transportation continues to produce very strong results with organic revenue growth of 10% in the quarter. Growth was driven broadly with continued strength across our auto business and improving performance within our aerospace & defense and maritime & trade businesses.","Our recent acquisition of automotiveMastermind is performing well and will be a strong growth driver for us in the years ahead. Financial Services reported 6% organic growth with strength across our information and solutions businesses. In particular, a strong quarter for pricing, indices, valuation services, managed loan services, and enterprise data management businesses.","CMS organic revenue growth was 5%, as we are benefiting from improving end markets and also operational changes since merging. And finally, in Resources, we were pleased with 3% organic growth as our upstream energy business continues to improve and our mid and downstream businesses remain strong.","We are confident in our low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for 2018 and mid-single-digit organic growth rate for our annual contract value. This view is in part supported by an increasing CapEx spend environment for our customers as we forecast the price of oil to average in the 60s in 2018.","In the beginning of March, we held our annual CERAWeek conference, which brought together over 4,000 global industry leaders and policymakers from over 60 countries and the entire energy value chain. The CERAWeek team managed another great event with record attendance and revenues.","We had growing segment participation from across our firm, including Financial Services, which exemplifies the powerful value proposition of the combined IHS Markit and gives us confidence in achieving our revenue synergy target for the year. From my conversations with customers and industry leaders, it was great to sense increasing confidence and optimism in the underlying energy market dynamics.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Relative to Q1 financial results, revenue was $932 million, an increase of 10%, and organic revenue growth of 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million, an increase of 12%, with margin of 38.6%, up 70 basis points. And adjusted EPS was $0.53, an increase of $0.08 or 18%. Relative to revenue, we were pleased with Q1 revenue and the continuation of positive revenue trends from the back half of last year.","Looking at segment performance. Transportation revenue growth was 20%, including 10% organic, 7% acquisitive, and 2% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 11% recurring and 10% nonrecurring. We continue to see very strong growth in our automotive businesses and remain confident in our ability to drive high single-digit organic growth in our Transportation segment.","Resources revenue growth was 4%, including 3% organic and 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring and 8% nonrecurring. Recurring organic growth was driven by strong growth in chemicals, PGCR and our downstream pricing businesses. Upstream revenue was flat, which was significantly improved versus prior year.","Our Q1 ACV across the entire Resources segment, including OPIS, was $709 million, which was flat to comparable beginning-of-year ACV. Nonrecurring organic growth was driven primarily by strong energy software sales. CMS revenue growth was 9%, including 5% organic, 1% acquisitive and 2% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring and 21% nonrecurring.","All of our CMS business lines, product design, TMT and ECR, posted improved performance in Q1. We remain confident that CMS will deliver to its low single-digit revenue growth target in 2018. Financial Services revenue growth was 8%, including 6% organic and 3% FX. ","Information organic growth was 9%. Our indices business continued to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and our valuation services and bond pricing businesses also continued to deliver strong growth. Processing organic revenue declined 2% in the quarter due to lower volumes in our credit derivatives business.","Solutions organic revenue growth was 6%, led by our regulatory and compliance solutions and continued growth in our WSO loan management business. Overall, we expect to deliver within our longer-term 4% to 6% organic growth range in Financial Services for 2018.","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million, up 12% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.6%, up 70 basis points. Core margin expansion normalized for FX and AMM was 220 basis points. FX impacted margin percent by 70 basis points as a weaker U.S. dollar resulted in higher revenue and offsetting higher expense in non-U.S. dollar currencies. AMM impacted margin percent by 80 basis points.","Regarding segment profitability. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $110 million with a margin of 40.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.9%, excluding AMM, an increase of over 390 basis points versus prior year. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $85 million with a margin of 41.4%, up 80 basis points versus prior year.","CMS adjusted EBITDA was $32 million with a margin of 23.1%, up 50 basis points versus prior year. And Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $145 million with a margin of 45.5%, up 180 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.53 per diluted share, an $0.08 or 18% improvement over the prior year. Our adjusted EPS includes an adjusted tax rate of 20%, in line with our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 18% to 20%.","Our GAAP tax rate was minus 156%, due primarily to an estimated $136 million net benefit from onetime items associated with U.S. tax reform. Specifically, revaluation of our deferred tax liability of $174 million, offset somewhat by a repatriation tax liability estimate of $38 million. Q1 free cash flow was $148 million, our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $670 million and represented a conversion rate of 47%.","Normalized conversion, excluding acquisition-related costs, was 53%. We expect an improvement in cash conversion throughout the remainder of the year and to be within our mid-60s target for the year. Our quarter-end debt balance was $4.3 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6x on a bank-covenant basis. And we closed the quarter with $156 million cash.","Our Q1 diluted weighted average share count was 412 million shares. We executed $249 million of share repurchases in Q1. In addition, we executed a $500 million ASR on March 1, which resulted in initial delivery of approximately 80% of ASR value or 8.5 million shares. We will receive delivery of the remaining shares upon completion of the ASR in Q2. In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our 2018 guidance from our January 16 earnings call, further increasing revenue by $25 million to reflect favorable impact from FX.","For the year, we now expect $35 million revenue benefit from FX. The guidance provides for revenue of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion with organic growth of 4% to 5%. We expect continued solid revenue delivery throughout the year, but also expect revenue growth to moderate in the back half of the year due to more challenging year-over-year comparisons.","We also expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion. Margin will be negatively impacted by approximately 35 basis points from FX, as we will report higher revenue and offsetting higher expense from FX. But we do expect to deliver our 100-basis points margin expansion target normalized for FX.","We expect adjusted EPS of $2.23 to $2.27. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 9% at the midpoint. We had a good start to the year and are focused on delivering the shareholder commitments we made at the beginning of the year, while continuing to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We look forward to providing further updates as the year progresses.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. I'm pleased with our start to 2018 and feel confident in our ability to achieve our financial guidance for the year due to our execution and stable to improving end markets. We'll continue to take advantage of the merger synergies and our combined scale to make incremental investments that will help us better serve our customers and to aid in consistently delivering our longer-term annual financial commitments of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth, at least 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion as we move to our mid-40s target and a double-digit earnings growth.","Operator, we're ready to open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","Thank you, good morning. Lance, given the very strong start to the year and the positive momentum in organic growth you're seeing across the portfolio, it feels like the 4% to 5% organic growth rate for the year might be conservative. Can you give us your thoughts on that?","Lance Uggla","Sure, no, that's a fair question and one that we expected. But I think the \u2013 from our view, Peter, is if we go back to the merger, we did talk 0% to 2%. We hit 2%, as we said. We then talked 2% to 4%. We hit 4%. We peaked into 6% on the final quarter last year, and we've had a good, strong quarter this quarter. But I think our view is, is that it is just a quarter. We've got a full year ahead of us. If we have another good quarter like that, we'll reassess in the summer. But at the present time, we held our guidance where it was. Thank you.","Peter Appert","Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Bisbee of RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys, good morning. I guess on the Transportation business, obviously, you continue to do very well on the top line. But can you give us any more color what's driving such strong margin expansion before AMM? Obviously, at this type of revenue, this good operating leverage, but anything else going on? And how sustainable is that level of profitability improvement? Thank you.","Todd Hyatt","Well, I think with automotive, in particular, we've always balanced continued investment in the business and delivery of margin. And we really have built a story over the last 3 to 4 years, balancing those two items. So, it's not unusual to see margin push up a bit higher in one quarter versus another, depending on investment levels. But I think longer term, we've talked about moving all of these scaled information businesses into the high 40s range. And so, it was a strong quarter in auto, and the underlying information elements of that business provides substantial operating leverage. I mean, there wasn't \u2013 really, nothing more complicated than that, Gary.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone. So, a question for you on artificial intelligence. So, S&P Global recently spent $0.5 billion to acquire AI company, Kensho, the thought being that they were going to use it to accelerate cost efficiencies and new product development. So, I wanted to ask you to talk a little bit about how you guys are using AI and machine learning within IHS Markit? And how you're thinking about the build-versus-buy trade-offs for those capabilities? And what I'm getting at is, are you going to need to make a similar type acquisition at some point?","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Bill. It's Lance. So, I guess the first thing is when I hear the word artificial intelligence, it's definitely probably one of the hyped buzzwords of the day and one that's impacting a lot of conversations. But if I look back in time, the types of things that we've done in terms of being an information company with a lot of operational activities, if you look back in time, a lot of cost effectiveness came from putting some of the operational jobs in the best-cost locations. But then ultimately, what we found over the last 10 years is that we could use machine learning, which you mentioned, which I'd put as the kind of lower-hanging fruit of artificial intelligence for an information company, to start to take repetitive operational processes and use computerized or computer augmentation or assistance to actually do a lot of those functions.","We've been doing a lot of that for the past 10 years and have significant efficiencies around those types of operational activities. The next-level AI comes when we start to move up the food chain from there, where we actually want the machine learning to actually improve over time with built-in processes of intelligence. And that's again, as an information company, something that we spend a fair bit of time internally. And through the merger, we did put in a new role of Chief Data Science, which is another great buzzword today, but somebody that's using math and science, quantitatively led, a high use of technology, can manage operational processes and improve them with AI. And Yaacov Mutnikas, who reports to myself, is our Chief Data Scientist. And as we've said on previous calls, we have about well north of 20 proof-of-concepts, of which 5 or 6 have now moved into pilot. These are all AI-driven.","Now, go a bit further up the food chain and we get into natural language processing. Here, we're using computer augmentation to help us leverage available public-based, web-based Internet content to \u2013 in a multi-language setting to take events from the World Wide Web, classify them and then insert them into our data sets. And those data sets are both in Economics & Country Risk and in our aerospace & defense, Jane's business, where we're looking to achieve operational synergies and also improved amount of content that can be explored to insert into our events catalogs. So, as a firm, we're doing a lot ourselves. We'll continue to do a lot ourselves. We haven't considered or looked at any acquisitions in that space, but Yaacov's team is now built up to be a significant team within the firm. It's part of the area we're investing in, and we think it's a lot of \u2013 the hype around AI is business as usual for IHS Markit. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Hi Lance. How are you?","Lance Uggla","Good.","Kevin McVeigh","So, great job leveraging the market synergies. Can you just give us a sense of kind of \u2013 is it possible to maybe calibrate the upside from the synergies and how you've enabled that from a reinvestment perspective into the business?","Lance Uggla","Yes, so on the cost \u2013 are you talking cost or revenues?","Kevin McVeigh","Cost.","Lance Uggla","Yes, okay. So, on the cost side, we \u2013 when we merged, we said that we'd have a minimum $125 million. I think we also said at the end of last year that we \u2013 the $125 million was in hand, and then we also said that anything above $125 million, we'd invest back in the business. And we talked about four key categories that we felt incremental investment would lead to a higher propensity to achieve the top end of our range. And we really feel that some of those incremental investments that we've been able to put to work, some of the things just we're speaking to on Bill's question around AI and data science and data analytics, those are areas where we can leverage the overall content sets of our firm to improve our research, our insights, our valuations, et cetera.","So, the $125 million was a good number, and we were able to put that to \u2013 get that in hand and any additional merger synergies put back into our business. On the revenue side, we targeted $100 million run rate at the next year's exit, 2019, and I think we had, had $10 million, $35 million, $100 million, and in fact we feel, if anything, the momentum on revenue synergies has been accelerating as we really look at \u2013 we were quite excited around CERAWeek, where we really could see the intersection of energy with financial market participants that want to finance the energy companies, with the automotive companies intersecting around mobility and the shifts in the supply of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles, how that's going to impact energy prices, as well as demands on the power grid. That was a very interesting intersection.","And then finally, the biggest intersection in the middle of all of this is technology, and of course, the Internet of Things. The leveraging of the cloud for information and distribution, the use of cheap storage and the fast analytics and much bigger chips is impacting all our business. So, we really felt IHS Markit come together around CERAWeek and it really felt like a firm-wide event, not a divisional event. Maybe next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","I guess the one thing that came up to my mind when you talked about the natural language processing and web scraping, it reminded me of, I guess, the GDPR regulations that are coming through. I was just hoping you could address maybe how prepared you guys are and thoughts around that.","Lance Uggla","Yes, that's an easy answer, Manav. We have to be prepared and we have to do an excellent job, and our teams have it in hand, and we don't foresee any challenges there. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Lance, we also heard those themes at CERAWeek, and I just wanted to make sure I understood. When the energy companies are talking about investing in digital technology and analytics, does that directly help the spend with IHS? Or is that a spend that they're more doing kind of internally on analytics using IHS data? And might some of the spend on technology be more with software providers Emerson or oil services company, Schlumberger?","Lance Uggla","Yes, no, that's both really. So, we \u2013 of course, our data sets provide the fuel into analytics, so that's a positive, but we also have a large geoscience and engineering business that is made up of several software assets. Those assets have been \u2013 the primary one there, Vantage, has been working closely with our data science team to build out much more rapid scenario analysis for asset valuations, giving us a competitive edge in terms of data and analytics. So, thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","Yeah, thank you. Maybe a different variation on Peter's question. So, I appreciate the consistently hitting numbers, Lance. But when you guys are calling out the tougher comps in the back half, it looks to me like that's largely, I guess, the Resources segment where the bookings are expected to continue to improve and that incrementally flows through positively to revenue over time. So, Todd or Lance, any other call-outs on where there might be headwinds or things that should weaken? Because I think Resources gets better and processing is already facing tough comps and down. So, other than maybe like CMS nonrecurring or just any other areas that you'd call out that we should be cognizant of where growth may decelerate?","Todd Hyatt","I wouldn't say anything specific. You hit the primary one, I think, being processing. But when we look at the performance, we've seen progressively improved performance, really over the last five quarters. And so, it's certainly easier to grow at 6% when you're comparing to a 1% from the prior year. So, I think the key for us is to continue to sustain the growth level as we move into the back half of the year. And I think, aside from processing, aside from boiler code, I wouldn't call out discrete items, but it's just ensuring that we maintain that momentum as we move through the year and performing in a way that we're delivering to the expectations that we've made that are delivering a robust level of revenue and profit to the shareholders.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Hi, thanks. Wondering if \u2013 on CMS, you talked about improved execution and better market there. But can you elaborate, I guess, in the nonrecurring strength there, is that sustainable? I guess just on kind of the underlying trends as we look forward there?","Todd Hyatt","Well, first, as I said, we did see improved performance in all three sub business lines in CMS, so kudos to Ian, [indiscernible] and Chad for delivering that performance. Relative to nonrecurring, we did have I believe $2 million of boiler code revenue, and we did have some software that hit in Q1 that drove a significant nonrecurring growth number. And we certainly wouldn't expect that to repeat as we move through the year. And I think the sub number was 3% for CMS, which is more indicative of what we see when we talk about a low single growth rate for that segment.","Lance Uggla","I guess on the \u2013 adding to that on the operational side, I think Adam Kansler has been working with [indiscernible] and the team on ECR to build out a much bigger financial markets presence, and I think the team's done some great work there, and that gives them some tailwinds. Also, Ian Weightman on the TMC side, we've really taken technology and brought it up in the firm in terms of giving it a front row seat in terms of Ian leading it, reporting into Jonathan Gear. And the team there is really looking forward in extracting as much as it can out of its current products in a market that's favorable for technology. And then as Todd mentioned, Chad is doing a great job as well. So, a good shout out for all those three teams and they're working hard to be part of our growth. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm ","Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to dig into Resources again a little bit more. I mean, you put up 3% organically, which if I'm correct, is already at the high end of your guidance for the year. So, I guess if I think about the outlook for the rest of the year, what would it take for that number to actually continue to tick higher, in particular, on the outlook? And if it ticks higher, would we expect some of that upside potentially flowing to the bottom line? How are you thinking about it?","Lance Uggla","I think Todd said it right. He gave me an Aristotle quote and said, \"A swallow does not a summer make,\" and I thought that was a good start for the call. And the fact is that it's one quarter. And we merged our companies, we've been very focused on delivering what we say we're going to do and we're really pleased that we have a 3% number. Energy is a diversified division, and I think far too much focus historically just on the upstream because it had such a weight of 65%. But the fact is, is we have the world-leading chemicals team. ","We've got OPIS leading in pricing and news in gas. We've got a great power and gas franchise and building renewables presence. And in upstream, we're still the world's thought leaders. We've got the deepest data sets, and we have a recovering CapEx. So, hey, we're back into some low single digits, let's see how we look at the end of the next quarter, and we'll go from there. But we think that low single digits is the right price for our guide \u2013 right level for our guidance, and we're just one quarter into the year. Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open.","Henry Chien ","Hi. It's Henry Chien for Jeff. Just wanted to dig into Financial Services. So, it seems like momentum has been pretty solid here. Just wondering how should we think about what could improve the organic growth rate here. Should we think about the end markets \u2013 or Financial Services markets either activity improving or profitability of the sector improving or maybe some of the synergies that you've talked in the past? Just curious how you're thinking about for the rest of the year what could tick-up improved momentum in this segment.","Lance Uggla","Yes, it's a \u2013 there are some tough comps in Financial Services in the second half, so I think that's the Number 1 thing that puts us in a place of being conservative and cautious and making sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves. So, I think you have to look at the comps forward and go, wow, last year was a big year. So that would be my Number 1 thing I'd have on my page. Outside of that, volatility is something that financial markets like. It creates activity. So, a few of the geopolitical and kind of political posturing, tariffs, a whole bunch of things that are driving some volatility in marketplaces, make markets interesting and, therefore, more active.","So that might be a tick, but a tick that I would put very cautiously as we can see with the seesaw impacts that we've been seeing to financial markets. I would say that there's a strong trend that's been going for the last many years on passive investment, and our index franchise continues. Todd called it out again today. Indices and pricing, solid performers and we've put those on the plus side. And then finally, regulation. SFTR is a trade reporting regulation our teams developed a product for to meet regulations just announced. And they signed up 32 market participants and have the leading product. So, regulation still is a little bit of a tailwind as the implementation continues to take hold. So, I think we've got constructive good markets around us, a tough comp in the second half and some political uncertainty that could put pluses or minuses. So, at this point in time, we just hold firm to the guidance we've given you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could maybe give us a sense of how sales force productivity is tracking in your system and what metrics you look at there and whether there's any room for improvement as you look out over the next few years. Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Okay, I can see you guys aren't breaking us down on the financial side, so you're hitting us from AI, sales force productivity. Brand-new questions we haven't studied yet. So, sales force \u2013 hey, for any company, we all want to have the best sales force productivity possible. So, for us, we've broken our sales teams into account management and sales specialists. Sales specialists are commission-led so are very much self-motivated hunters, and they work within their product groups and they do an exceptional job to go out and close deals and renew deals and make sure that revenue is brought in. ","The addition of account managers across the firm, so we now have both financial market account managers that look for all the revenue synergies across the big financial players. We also, under Mark Rose, have \u2013 who is one of our senior energy experts, is leading account managers across corporates. And so, for us, we feel that if we cover our biggest corporate customers and financial market customers with account managers that are not led by the commission of the sales, but rather by deepening the relationship, and then organizing our sales specialists and product specialists into the account, we have a much more productive group. So, we've done that, that's been the last two years' work, and we're seeing the fruits of that and we're quite pleased with that.","The second thing that gives us productivity is using technology. And so, at the base, if you want to be \u2013 go to the lowest-hanging fruit, of course, you have to have a good CRM. And when we merged, we had three. So, by fall of this year, we'll have a single CRM for all our sales teams globally. And that gives you the tools then to be more productive. More productive with the prescreening, the pipeline management, taking your sales team and products through the stages of closing, qualifying, and closing a deal and then, obviously, the renewing and managing the post sales. And for us, there's only one thing we want to do, is we want to be world class and we want to constantly improve productivity. And I think we've got all the knowledge and capability to do so, and we're working hard to make sure we set a high bar. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Lance Uggla","Joe, are you there?","Joseph Foresi","Hello, can you hear me?","Lance Uggla","Yes, we can hear you now.","Joseph Foresi","I'll see if I can throw a curveball. But anything to call out from a revenue or a margin trajectory through the rest of the year? And can we get an update on the processing business? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","I wouldn't call out anything specifically. I mean, Q4 is our biggest quarter; Q1 is our smallest quarter. I think when you look at the ratable delivery year-over-year \u2013 the one thing I would say, this Q1, obviously, quite a bit bigger than last year Q1, but you're comparing a 1% organic grower last year to 6% organic grower this year. So, I think that probably balances out the two years a bit more. But I would expect the same seasonal dynamic. We don't have the code this year in Q3. We had it last year. From a processing perspective, the loan processing, flattish, slightly up.","Derivative processing, I talked about credit was a bit of a drag. And as Lance said, I think the volatility tends to create more activity, particularly in the derivative processing. And then I think the capital markets refinancing, we'll see how the loan processing business performs this year. Last year was a very strong year, so tough comps, and that's why when we look in balance across processing, we basically have built in an expectation in the low single-digit decline.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning. Just looking at the past year, you've been around high 40s to low 50s free cash flow conversion rate. So, Todd, I was just hoping you could remind us of what the dynamics will be that will drive that into the mid-60s for this year.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I think the big thing, Toni, is we had substantial billings that occurred in Q1, and obviously, we will be collecting much of that as we move into Q2, Q3. Historically, Q2, Q3 have been our strongest cash quarters and the dynamic really follows billing patterns for the business. Expect the interest number to track in line with the guide around interest expense. Expect free \u2013 expect cash tax to be at or slightly improved to last year and then CapEx, from a guide perspective, we said would be down a bit. So those are really the big drivers of the cash flow. I think the other thing is the acquisition-related costs. As we move into future quarters, we'll see that number come down substantively as we wrap up much of the integration activity moving into the back half of the year.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the ACV in Resources, and I wasn't sure I heard you correctly. I thought I heard $709 million, and I think last quarter, we talked about it being $630 million without OPIS, expecting $730 million with OPIS. And it seems like it's just lower. I don't know if there's a difference in the calculation or something's not tracking the way that you guys expected. If you can just give us a little more clarity on that.","Todd Hyatt","No, I mean ACV is tracking as we expected. I mean we did add OPIS into the numbers and are flat in the quarter. And I think a flat performance in the quarter for us is not hugely surprising. I mean, there's some variability inside of quarterly activity, so nothing \u2013 I don't think anything from our perspective that's concerning or surprising. We still believe that we'll deliver low to mid-single-digit sub base growth for the year and that's a metric we'll continue to report on for the year. The one thing that does move the numbers around a bit, Shlomo, is FX. So, as we reset the beginning of the year, we reset it for current exchange rates. So that could be an item, but we can walk through the reconciliation with you.","Lance Uggla","Thanks. Thanks, Shlomo. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good morning. Todd, you indicated a commitment to deliver 100 bps of annual EBITDA margin expansion normalized for FX. Can you discuss how much of an FX impact you expect on margins for the full-year? And whether you're open to toggling your investment activity to hit 100 bps of margin expansion after FX, especially given your strong market cost synergies to date?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, so FX, and we've talked about this in the past, we certainly have exposure at the revenue level. As the dollar strengthens, we have less revenue. As the dollar weakens, we have more revenue. We have very equal offsetting natural hedges in expenses. And so, you saw it in the prior years where a strengthening dollar, despite the fact that it impacted revenue, it really had very little impact on profit. Now what we see is a weakening dollar. ","In the quarter, we saw 2% FX benefit, so call it, $18 million of additional revenue flowing through from FX. But we also have an offsetting amount of expense flowing through from FX. That's really a nonoperational item. And from our perspective, it doesn't make any sense to try to close a nonoperational item and try to over deliver the margin relative to that. So, as we think of margin delivery, we look at that on a normalized FX basis. And relative to investment, as we've said in the past, we'll balance delivery to shareholders, believe that this guidance is robust delivery of profit and we'll balance that with continued investment in the business so that we ensure that we can sustain future growth.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Ridley-Lane","Good morning. Just wanted to get a sense of the relative impact of higher volatility within the Financial Services segment. Is that a notable positive here in the first quarter? And then if I could sneak one in, would you have any interest in acquiring an electronic bond trading platform? According to press reports, there are several assets that are potentially up for sale. Is that an area of interest for you?","Lance Uggla","Okay, we're not going to have any comments on any acquisitions, but we haven't engaged in any of the rumored sales that you spoke about either. The first question, with respect to volatility, it's \u2013 I don't really think in the quarter it had any major impact to us. Where volatility sometimes can impact IHS Markit in an interesting way has to be around volume-based businesses because we have a recurring business model, so whether markets are busy or slow, most of our services are demanded regardless. But where there can be impacts for volatility would be really two places. So, one, in the derivatives market, higher-volatility marketplaces usually mean the trade size is smaller and more frequent. And given we're paid per trade, that generally, on a historical basis, has worked out to be a positive.","So, in tough fixed income markets where fixed income revenues were down, we found our rates processing business was improving. The second piece is that when interest rates start to rise, you see a lot of corporates wanting to extend term and lock in rates and, therefore, our loan processing business can see additional activity. And those are two places where I'd say volatility can impact and can have a \u2013 can add to a quarter in Financial Services. Outside of that, I don't think, at least in my initial thoughts here, there's any major places where there could be an impact, and we didn't see that impact in the quarter. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Gary Bisbee of RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, just one quick follow-up, another one on margins. The Financial Services business, Lance, prior to the merger, you talked about flattish margins and there was some mix with lower-margin things, parts of the business growing more quickly than processing, which had the highest margins. And yet in the last 1.5 years, you've had consistent and very strong margin expansion in the Financial Services business. Is this just a product of the cost synergies that the company's delivered? Or there's some other drivers within the financial business that's allowed this strong leverage you've been delivering? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","I think \u2013 well, I think two things. I think premerger, we were investing in the solutions businesses, and therefore, we were managing \u2013 we felt our margins were good, and we invested incrementally. At the time of the merger, we looked at the whole \u2013 the merger, we looked at the cost synergies and then we set a 3 to 5-year vision for the firm, and we said mid-40s. That's the home for IHS Markit and we're going to look at how do we develop our strategy to achieve a mid-40s margin across all our businesses. And of course, it comes from operational gains, which come through improving revenue, but also on the cost side, and we have a very focused best-cost strategy.","We have seven significant locations, Minsk, Gdansk, Bucharest, in Eastern Europe; we have Penang in Southeast Asia; and we have Bangalore, Noida and Gurgaon, totaling 4,000 or approximately a third of our teams. And of course, that's margin enhancing and has been a great way for us to manage attrition and build our forward strategy towards the mid-40s. We also said at the time of merger that we were going to use technology to gain a competitive edge, both on product development, but if you remember, we also said that it'll be strongly supportive to us creating efficiencies and efficiencies gains.","Now technology can be used to be able to operate remotely well, but it also can be used through AI and machine learning to actually become more effective on some of our operational jobs. And I think the teams across the board, every division, has a remote strategy. Every division has a long-term sight to margin. And as a firm, as a whole, we truly believe that we're marching towards mid-40s, and we're going to give you at least 100 basis points each year because we think over and above that, as stewards of the company, we should be investing in our future. And that's really important to us. I don't know, Todd, do you want to add to that?","Todd Hyatt","No, we're good.","Lance Uggla","No. So good. Okay, so that's it. Thanks. Next question.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Eric Boyer","Okay, we thank you for your interest in IHS Markit.

As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Eric Boyer","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other times. IHS Markit believes its non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance. But they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risk and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit's filings with SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Happy New Year and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 earnings call. Today we'll review our Q4 and 2018 financial performance, reaffirm our 2019 outlook, and discuss the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. ","2018 was a very successful year for IHS Markit on all fronts. Financially, we delivered strong results with organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of a 100 basis points excluding Ipreo and FX and year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 11%. We also completed the acquisition of Ipreo, and made great progress on our longer term strategic initiatives. ","We finished the year with a solid Q4 and we are reaffirming our 2019 financial guidance. We remain comfortable with our outlook even with increased uncertainty over global growth from when we last spoke in November. We believe that our role as a trusted partner, our mission-critical solutions, recurring business model, and diversification will help us perform well through all business cycles. Operationally, we're performing with the right sense of urgency and we feel good about the momentum that we have within each of our end markets.","A few points that bode well for 2019. Energy is still consolidating growth off a low base. Automotive is well diversified and investments are bearing fruit. CMS is reorganized and positioned to grow at a steadier rate. And Financial Services will continue to have solid recurring revenue growth, while our non-recurring revenue could see both two way variability. ","We also remain focused on executing against various operating levers to help us deliver upon our adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth targets independent of the business environment. ","Over the past two years, we've also termed out our capital structure and significantly improved our free cash flow conversion which positions us to increasingly return capital to shareholders. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to produce strong results in 2019 and the years to come.","So, now on to the financial highlights for Q4. Revenue of $1.068 billion, up 5% year-over-year on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA $417 million and margin of 39.1%. Margin expansion was 100 basis points excluding Ipreo and FX, and adjusted EPS of $0.57 a share, up 10% over the prior year. ","In terms of core industry verticals, I'll provide some Q4 and full year 2018 highlights and forward-looking commentary. First, our Transportation segment continues to produce very strong results with organic revenue growth of 10% in the quarter and 11% for the year. Growth across the segment continues to drive strong results.","In 2018, we made significant strides in leveraging IHS Markit\u2019s Advanced Analytics capabilities to extend the value of our core data assets. We now launched a new freight rate forecasting service and developed a number of successful proof-of-concepts around commodity tracking, security events, and automotive forecasting.","We also successfully integrated Mastermind into our portfolio and developed the Conquest marketing product that helps OEMs and dealers better target new customers, which is increasingly important. In 2019, we expect high-single-digit organic revenue growth within Transportation, anchored by diversified set of growth drivers across the segment. ","Our used car business will continue to see strength from used car listings, banking and insurance products, and our core vehicle history report business.","In the new car market, we're focused on delivering ever more granular production and technology forecasts and analytics to the entire automotive supply chain. Demand is driven by stringent emissions and fuel economy regulatory policies, as well as the adoption of autonomous driving technologies and new forms of mobility.","Also in Transportation, there\u2019s growth from our maritime and trade and aerospace and defense businesses. They will accelerate somewhat as we introduce new offerings, leveraging expanded datasets, and analytics driven insights to our customers. ","Resources organic growth was 4% in Q4, and for the full year, also 4%. We also ended the year with annual contract value in line with our expectations, which supports our forward view for 2019.","In 2018, we launched several new product capabilities around sustainability, mobility, and LNG analytics. We had a record CERAWeek with increased participation from the broader IHS Markit areas of expertise. We also formed a new financial capital markets team to control [ph] business with financial and capital markets across all of our resource businesses.","In 2019, we expect organic revenue growth, up 4% to 6%. We expect CapEx spending to continue to improve in \u201819 but for the industry to remain disciplined with regards to spending and financial returns. We are seeing good renewal rates, which supports our view that our upstream business should continue to gradually improve. ","Within our mid and downstream businesses, which comprises 35% of our Resources revenue, we expect continued solid performance. Within Resources, we will look towards an accelerated amount of product innovation around analytics and visualization to enhance existing datasets and to create entirely new solutions for our customers.","Financial Services organic growth was 4% in Q4 and finished the year at 6%, which was another strong year. We accomplished a lot in 2018, including the acquisition and integration of Ipreo. Cost synergies are tracking in line with expectations as are the revenue synergies with multiple transactions already closed. We continue to see growth from investments and innovation within our derivatives pricing and valuations businesses. ","We also advanced partnerships, developed key new relationships to provide best-in-class solutions in the areas of liquidity analytics, collateral management, and initial margin calculations.","In 2019, we expect organic growth within Financial Services in the 4% to 6% range or 6% to 8% when including Ipreo for a full 12 months. We expect our pricing and reference data, valuation services and index businesses to continue to attract new customers, given the high quality and broad coverage of our products. ","Within solutions, our regulatory and compliance businesses will continue to benefit from our investments in products that help our customers meet regulatory challenges and reduce operating costs. And we expect another solid year from our portfolio management and EDM businesses. ","We see improving trends in derivative markets, while loan markets remain cautious in light of market volatility. And finally, we expect Ipreo to deliver low-to-mid teens organic growth, driven by continued market share gains and product expansion within its capital markets, corporate solutions, and private capital markets businesses. ","Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was flat in the quarter. For the full year, revenue growth was 3% normalized for the Boiler Code.","In 2018 within product design, we saw a rebound in standard fundamentals within its oil and gas customer base. Within TMT, we expanded our performance, benchmarking capabilities to include a broader range of electronics, including semiconductor chipsets, gaming platforms and the Internet of things networks. ","And finally, within ECR we experienced strong demand to help customers understand the implications of new tariffs on trades. In 2019 within CMS we expect to deliver low to mid single-digit organic growth normalized for the Boiler Code. ","Moving on to our IHS Markit merger synergies. We completed our cost synergy program and surpassed our $125 million target. We incrementally invested additional synergies in our four strategic areas of investment: People, technology, product and customers. We are already starting to reap the rewards of these incremental investments such as increased product innovation through data science, which will help us deliver to our longer term financial commitments in the years to come. ","In terms of revenue synergies, in 2018, we met our $35 million run rate goal and expect continued momentum in 2019. ","In closing, we achieved a lot in 2018 and are focused on delivering to our forward commitments to create value for our shareholders. This will include consistent delivery of organic revenue growth including Ipreo of 5% to 7%, a 100 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion as we move to our mid 40s margin target and double-digit earnings growth. ","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd. ","Todd Hyatt ","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started, as a reminder, we closed Ipreo on August 2nd. And as a result, our Q4 results include a full quarter of Ipreo and our year-to-date results include four months of Ipreo. On a year-to-date basis Ipreo contributed in line with our expectations with a $102 million of revenue and $27 million of adjusted EBITDA. ","Now for the Q4 results. Revenue was $1.068 billion, an increase of 13%, an organic growth of 5%. GAAP net income was $81 million and GAAP EPS was $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $417 million, an increase of 14% with margin of 39.1%. And adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of $0.05 or 10%. ","We were pleased with the finish to the year and the strong revenue and profit performance we delivered throughout 2018. Relative to revenue, our Q4 organic revenue growth of 5% included stable recurring organic growth of 6% and non-recurring organic growth of 1%. ","Looking at segment performance. Transportation revenue growth was 11%, including 10% organic, 2% acquisitive and negative 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 10% recurring and 9% non-recurring. ","Resources revenue increased 3% including 4% organic and negative 1% FX. The organic revenue increase was comprised of 4% recurring and 1% non-recurring. Our Q4 ACV increased $5 million and our full year ACV increased $22 million. We ended the year with ACV of $732 million which was up 3% versus prior year. We continue to transit an ACV level in line with our 2019 revenue expectation.","CMS revenue declined 1% including flat organic revenue growth and negative 1% FX. Organic revenue was negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from prior year Boiler Code. CMS recurring organic growth was 2% and non-recurring declined 11% or $2 million primarily due to prior year Boiler Code. ","Financial Services revenue growth was 27%, including organic revenue of 4%, acquisitive growth of 24% and negative 1% FX impact. Recurring fixed organic growth was 7%, in line with our full year growth trends and recurring variable organic growth was 3%. Non-recurring organic declined $3 million or 12% versus the prior year.","Our information business increased 2% including 3% organic growth, led by strength in our pricing and reference data and valuation services business. Processing declined 6%, including 5% organic decline. And solutions increased 10%, including 10% organic growth. Solutions growth was led by our loan services business.","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $417 million, up 14% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.1%, up 100 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX and up 40 basis points on a reported basis. ","Regarding segment profitability, Transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $117 million with margin of 39.3%, down 210 basis points versus prior year due to lower margin recall revenue and a higher marketing spend in our CARFAX business to support forward product initiatives. ","Resources adjusted EBITDA was $99 million with margin of 44.4%, up 180 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $35 million with margin of 25.5%, up 210 basis points. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $179 million with margin of 43.9%, up 180 basis points normalized for Ipreo and down 210 points on a reported basis.","Adjusted EPS was $0.57 per diluted share, a $0.05 or 10% improvement over the prior year. Q4 free cash flow was $303 million. Our full year free cash flow was $1.067 billion and represented a conversion rate of 68%.","Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end debt balance was $5.7 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.2 times on a bank covenant basis. We closed the quarter with $120 million of cash and our year-end undrawn revolver balance was approximately $892 million.","Our Q4 and full year weighted average diluted share count was 406.7 million and 406.9 million shares respectively. Our full year share repurchases were approximately $768 million or 16.2 million shares, an average price of $47.40.","Moving to full year financial results, total full year revenue was $4.009 billion, which represented growth of 11% including 6% organic, 5% acquisitive and 1% FX. Revenue growth for the Transportation segment was 17%, including 11% organic. Resources revenue growth was 4%, including 4% organic. CMS revenue growth was 3% including 2% organic. CMS organic growth normalized for Boiler Code was 3%. Financial Services revenue growth was 15%, including 6% organic. Within Financial Services, organic growth was 7% for information, 9% for solutions and negative 1% for processing.","Turning now to reported profits. GAAP net income was $539 million with GAAP EPS of $1.33. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.565 billion, up 13% versus a year ago and up 11% excluding Ipreo. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 39% with a 100 basis points margin expansion excluding Ipreo and FX and reported margin expansion of 40 basis points. And adjusted EPS was $2.29 per diluted share, an increase of $0.22 or 11%.","In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our 2019 guidance which we provided on our November 8th guidance call. This guidance provides for revenue of $4.425 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including Ipreo four month stub period organic contribution. Including Ipreo for 12 months would increase total organic growth to 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.78 billion, including adjusted EBITDA of $115 million from Ipreo. Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points, excluding Ipreo, and normalized for FX and an 80 basis point margin expansion, including Ipreo. Adjusted EPS of $2.52 to $2.57, which represents adjusted EPS growth of 11% at guidance midpoint. ","In terms of the cadence of quarterly profitability, we expect the progression to be more back half loaded in 2019 as a result of the impact of Ipreo and new product initiatives launching in the first half. ","Finally, we expect cash conversion in line with our mid 60s target or more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow. ","In terms of capital allocation, we\u2019re focused on delevering to below 3 times and resuming our share buyback.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Todd. We had a strong 2018 and have good operational momentum entering 2019. I want to thank our colleagues around the world for their hard work in delivering for our customers and our shareholders. ","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Gary Bisbee ","Hey, guys. Good morning. Lance, ever since the merger of IHS Markit, you have talked about increasing reinvestment in product development, in people and analytics and all these things. I guess can you a couple of years in just give us a sense of how impactful that is today into either incrementally driving revenue or how much investment there is that might be impacting margins? Just trying to get a sense of how that\u2019s going and how important it is today versus a couple of years in the future? Thank you. ","Lance Uggla","Okay, good. Well on the revenue side, I think the impact is increasing innovation through analytics and data science in terms of improving existing products or incrementally improving existing offers with a positive revenue impact and some of the revenue synergies that are being driven are coming from the application of Advanced Analytics now. ","We also have invested in technology and platforms and those are our merger expenses but have made us more efficient and therefore bodes well for our continued margin expansion as we look forward. ","Learning and development was an area that showed up early on in terms of training and developing our management team and with 15,000 people globally and those located in more than 100 offices around the world. Leadership plays a big part in both getting your efficiencies as well as getting your products out the door. ","So I feel really positive about the vitality of the firm, the sense of urgency, the quality of people, the investments in platforms and seeing the brand of IHS Markit to continue to develop with the application of data science and analytics, and that bodes well. And I hope that at least 10% to 15% of our overall organic growth as we look forward can be attributed to the investments that we have been making. Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Peter Appert","Thank you, good morning. So Todd or Lance, the margin performance has obviously been pretty impressive here in last few years. Can you talk about the pathway to getting to the mid 40% margin? I am asking this in the context of this -- you\u2019re already there with regard to the financial side. Does it have to come disproportionately from CMS, how broad-based can the margin improvement be?","Lance Uggla","So maybe I can just start. So, our view on our mid-40s is supported by our location strategy, one. So we see a clear path through organizational design to use location as a continued expansion of margin, and that bodes very well for us. We have expensive locations, we have mid-cost locations, and we have better cost locations globally, but the quality of our people in each center is very similar. And so therefore, through organizational design and looking at forward attrition and investment, we feel very confident that we have continued margin expansion until we get into the mid-40s, and it's across all our businesses. It's not focusing on the businesses that have lower margins and trying to get more, it's just a constant across the whole firm and leveraging our operational footprint.","Some of our higher cost businesses are actually where we're producing non-recurring revenue, where we have consulting or professional services, and those tend to be three handles in terms of margins and we're not going to probably change much of that. So that's a small piece of our revenue. Core businesses have room for efficiencies and technology and location, and we're attacking both of those and we'll continue to do so.","Todd Hyatt ","Yes, as Lance said, we have a number of operational levers that we will execute against in the coming years to drive forward margin progression. When we look at it at the segment level, certainly with financials, Resources, and transport, those are segments that we see can move well up into the high-40s. We\u2019ve invested quite a lot in transport. We've driven a lot of growth there, but certainly opportunity for significant forward margin progression there. Resources, with the downturn, we were able to manage through stable margins. But I've always said I think Resources, probably the most heavy classic information business in the portfolio with a lot of operating leverage. Financials has always done a good job on margin, but we do see a forward progression there. ","You asked about CMS, yes, I think CMS, there are just structural realities within CMS with the royalty-bearing part of the business, certainly an area that we have invested in our underlying product platform within product design, and we think we can move margin up there, but it will perform at a much lower margin than the other segments.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Peter. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan calling in for Manav. Just a question. I mean, obviously, the highly subscription business but during periods of volatility like we saw with oil prices, again, kind of moving at the end of the year in the financial piece and just the equity markets, especially now with Ipreo in the mix, can you maybe walk us through how to think about your client conversations during these periods of volatility, and how that kind of flows into the subscription offering?","Lance Uggla","Right. Well, decisions that are made within the energy markets and where CapEx is being deployed, those are decisions that are being made based on current state with a forward look at energy prices. And when the CapEx is committed, our services come into play on a subscription basis, and they\u2019re long-term in line with the CapEx. And I think the really good thing for us that gives us significant confidence around our Resources plan of 4% to 6% is the fact that we're still consolidating off of a low base. And therefore, we can -- we've got good visibility and insight into the building book of business. ","Our mid to downstream businesses have performed right through the past several years with high-single digits overall when you add the OPIS franchise into that mix, chemicals, power, and gas. We really have a strong team that\u2019s done well on a recurring basis right through the last period and we don\u2019t see that changing.","So I\u2019d say with respect to your question, in Resources, we feel very good about our plan against the current environment, and our expectations of supply and demand forward as it impacts and creates changes to CapEx. ","We also have seen a bit of -- a large proportion of CapEx we saw focused into North America and we\u2019ve seen that CapEx distribution spread more broadly globally, and that also bodes well for our subscription-based businesses.","When you look into automotive, I think the comment there is our confidence in high single-digits come from the diversification of our businesses. We\u2019re highly diversified. We\u2019ve made investments. We\u2019ve made acquisitions. We cover a higher percentage of the used car market than the new but the new car market even with a slight decline in SAARs needs advertising investments around incentives to promote car purchases and exchange, and that bodes well for IHS Markit. Other parts of our business are subscription-based based on the OEM and suppliers\u2019 need that are tied to the absolute outcome of the marketplace. ","And then there\u2019s global growth in automotive in India, in China and changes in demands and knowledge needed and the autonomous vehicle in different parts of mobility, so bodes well. ","Financial markets, highly subscription-based, most of our services are needed regardless of the absolute level of financial markets, whether it\u2019s a busy fixed income or equities marketplace. But we do have parts of our revenue and I -- we called that out. So our non-recurring revenue is tied to derivatives processing, loan processing, issuance, part of the issuance in the capital markets. And therefore, we will be buoyed positively or negatively in terms of volatility in the market. But sometimes volatility in the market attracts a positive for us because there\u2019s more transactions and they\u2019re smaller in size. And so, recently in the press, you may have seen articles around credit derivatives, for example, a market that we\u2019ve been seeing decline month-after-month-after-month since 2008 and there were some recent articles in the press that referred to volumes approaching to highest levels in many years. And that\u2019s because the instrument becomes valuable for hedging and the view in the lack of underlying -- lack of liquidity in the credit markets. ","So, there are a bunch of pluses and minuses. But we\u2019ve applied those through our businesses and we\u2019ve looked at our guidance, we have adjusted our mindset to a tougher year and we\u2019ve reaffirmed that 5% to 6% with confidence. ","Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. ","Jeff Meuler ","Thank you. So when you gave the guidance in November for 2019 you kind of widened out the Ipreo range and I think that gave you some protection to the downside. But just the issuance in December and certain financial instruments seemed to really freeze up. So I guess what conditions could put the Ipreo guidance at risk and given the December freeze, is that an order of magnitude that\u2019s enough that we need to consider it in our Q1 modeling? And then Todd maybe if you could just go into a bit more detail. You had a call out in your prepared remarks about I think Ipreo and the ramp of new products that for second half should be stronger than the first. But just want to make sure that we get expectations aligned appropriately to incorporate your comment. Thanks. ","Lance Uggla","Okay, so I'll do the first one. When you think about Ipreo in terms of capital market issuance divided into three or -- three or four, really four, divided into municipals, fixed income, equities, private capital markets and think about those areas and how they can impact in different market environments. So to me high to lows on munis it's a market that has to finance, deals get done. They may be lumpy in different quarters with views et cetera. But highly -- the expectations of that within a range or highly a moderate level and the team has done a good job of reviewing that. ","In Fixed Income, very much subscription basis. So the incremental up or down there is small. And then in equities, there is a component that flows with the market. And you are right that, that is the component of the Ipreo side that -- which I can't forecast what the equity new issuance volumes will look like but I can look at the least number of deals done in the last 15 years including \u201808 and I can get a good flavor of what does that look like. And therefore I can give guidance and give it with confidence when I look at our overall business and I feel very confident with our 5% to 6% a 100 basis point margin and the double-digit earnings. That's what I feel confident with, the mix of that what's great about IHS Markit is we're well diversified across all of our businesses and that bodes well for our delivery. ","Todd, do you want to get the second part?","Todd Hyatt ","Yes, I mean relative to Ipreo, the products that are being deployed are private companies\u2019 product to allow private companies to basically model their underlying financial positions and really it's tied into the PCM business, the private capital markets business. ","We're also -- we've launched Investor Access, we see take rates moving up on that through the year and then we have some on-boarding of new companies through the year that will drive forward growth. I think in the rest of the portfolio probably the most notable items that we've talked about are Conquest and AMM. We see that progressing through the year. CARFAX, we have our CARFAX for Life product targeted in the service market being launched. And then we have some energy upstream analytic offering. So, I think we have a good pipeline of products and products that we have a reasonable level of confidence that that will have some level of success in the marketplace.","Lance Uggla","Good. Thanks, Todd. And we do -- when we did refer to early wins in our Ipreo merger, early revenue wins, multiple wins coming in that private capital market today, we see that as a continued strong growth area as that marketplace looks to develop independent dataset benchmarks mid and back-office tools. We love the space, it was part of the core component of the acquisition and we don't see that -- if anything, we see those players needing more of those services as we look forward regardless of the market environment as that will help them manage their businesses and give them an opportunity to be more efficient as well. ","So we're very pleased with that. Net-net as Todd and I've been saying what's most important to us is deliver what we say we're going to do and that combination across the divisions is something that we're very happy with. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Bill Warmington","A question. You guys beat -- you built -- beat your expectations today as well. On CMS, any additional portfolio rationalization plan there that might help organic growth and\/or margins going forward?","Lance Uggla","Yes, I think, actually, we've got three pieces to CMS, ECR, TMT and product design. We've given low to mid single-digits. Last year we gave low. This is -- at the time of merger you had TMT suffering within that RootMetrics space where it\u2019s just a lack of diversification across the client base globally, and therefore any consolidation of clients or exit of clients is expensive. And then happens with lots of small businesses that are heavy and not that well diversified across their client base. You can have consolidations of two competitors and have the revenue across those two. So TMT suffered from that, we've been through that, TMT does a lot more than that, they\u2019re benchmarking, they've expanded the benchmarking from mobile phone coverage into the Internet of things, cloud-based services, there are a variety of semiconductor-based benchmarking and really the team has done a good job to diversify and start to grow. And for TMT we see strong growth within CMS. So therefore that bodes well. ","Second thing, product design, product design faces the pressure of standard-setting bodies that pay royalties and less royalties is always better and that exists within that base and our team has done a great job to reorganize, extract margin. And I believe we\u2019re in a good position there to go into 2019 and look for a continued positive growth moving up gradually is what we say. ","And then ECR, we\u2019ve participated there with some growth in terms of our acquisition of Macroeconomic Advisers, hit its plan completely, bodes well looking forward into \u201819. Global trade wars, volatile economic environments, geopolitical risks, volatile interest rates, economists love that stuff. That\u2019s good thing for ECR. And not that I think we\u2019re going to see any double-digit growth there. Ralf Wiegert and his team, they\u2019re doing a good job consolidating at the low single-digits. And we believe we\u2019re doing a good job to manage that group. We really see the whole conversation of anything around acquisitions or divestitures to be very mute in 2019 from IHS Markit. ","We\u2019ll look at things, small bolt-ons, extremely small, we\u2019re very focused on the delevering and return of capital. And I don\u2019t see any real big change within CMS in terms of that, that business. I don\u2019t know, Todd, if you have anything?","Todd Hyatt","No, that\u2019s it. ","Lance Uggla","Okay. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","I just wondered, if you could elaborate a little bit on the information services, part of Financial Services segment? And you didn\u2019t mention in-depth I think as part of the performance there. So I guess how did that impact it? But just more broadly, there was a little slower growth. So what were the pros and cons I guess this quarter?","Lance Uggla","Well, information services, it\u2019s -- we have strong offerings in pricing and reference data, we\u2019ve strong offerings in valuations and independent valuations, that\u2019s derivative, that\u2019s loans, that\u2019s fixed income securities. So it\u2019s tough to manage type valuations, which become increasingly in demand in volatile markets, where there\u2019s not a lot of liquidity in trading, and therefore, the independent mark is a very, very important part of process. ","And then our index business, it\u2019s growing globally. It\u2019s grown every single quarter for the last many years. And we can see the buildup of new offerings, regional offerings. That bodes well for continued growth. ","Now, do I think is it coming from financial markets? Top financial markets, interest rates rising, fixed income ETFs, volumes declining a bit, I think our mix of business there will be slightly different through 2019, but not slightly different that means a lack of positive growth. And within the 4% to 6% for information services growth, again I have to say it's now 10 years that we've been overall 4% to 9% and that -- I don't see that range being breached in 2019. And I really probably couldn't tell you whether 4%, 5% or 6% is the number but pretty confident with our base level and our opportunity to outperform the 4%. ","Todd Hyatt ","Yes. The other thing I would add, Tim, I mean I would always be careful about reading a lot into a single quarter. Last year we were 10% in Q4 in information, it was a really strong quarter. Sequentially information is in line with the same revenue level as Q3. So performing like we would expect and I think feel good about the 4% to 6% range on a forward basis for information. ","Lance Uggla","Good point, Todd. Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman ","Good morning, guys. Two questions. The first one, could you give us a mix of revenues by Ipreo by asset classes, the asset classes you listed before munis, equities and private capital? My second question is, could you bridge the plus 3% that you shared with us on Resources ACV today at the end of 2018 with the fiscal \u201819 organic revenue growth for Resources targeted 4% to 6%. The things I'm thinking about is does ACV has to pick up to get there or you are counting on non-subs growing faster than subs in \u201819? ","Lance Uggla","I'll do the first one, and then Todd can do the second one. So, the first one answer is no. But what I would say given JP Morgan's breadth of businesses across our sectors I imagine the percentages would mirror that. ","Todd, if you want to do the second question? ","Todd Hyatt ","Yes I mean we do see the sub-base moving up in 2019 and that's certainly embedded in our forward view. And yes, when we talk about a mid single-digit grower for Resources we would expect to see that in both the recurring and the non-recurring. We last called this out in the script. We have a -- we were pleased with the renewal performance in year end through January. It's I think a market that will continue to grind it out and continue to see the sub-base move up through the year but we certainly do see Andrew ability to take the 3% that we drove in 2018 and grow on that and move it up into the mid single-digit percent. ","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Andrew Jeffrey ","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Happy New Year. I wonder -- you are lots of time talking about new solutions and obviously the organic revenue growth reflects some of the success you're having. Could you just expand a little bit on specific initiatives internally to drive maybe faster time to market and\/or comment generally on sales cycles? Can we see newer products come to market more quickly, things like Conquest I guess notwithstanding and can that support faster growth over time? ","Lance Uggla","Yes. So our view at the time of merger was investments in product were about vitality and innovation, and investments in technology were about improvement in the tech stack to improve products and development lifecycle, use of Advanced Analytics or you can put it under data science, if it feels like it gives more spring to it. But the fact is that two years ago, so we're two years in, we\u2019ve put all our technology, data science and analytics now under Yaacov at the end of last year. So we\u2019ve consolidated that into a single team. We have more than 20 proof-of-concepts, more than 10 pilots and more than five new product offerings come out of the innovation of analytics and data science with faster rapid use of technology in the cloud and the delivery to deliver some new products. ","Where have those been? They've been within asset valuation in the energy space. They've been with the tracking of security events, which was highlighted in the script today, where we're using natural language processing to more rapidly analyze our economic and country risk coupled with our aerospace and defense security events. So use of more technology, enhancing what our people can do and then offering incrementally more. That's a good use of new data science. ","We also have launched something called commodities at sea, which is taking our maritime and trade with our knowledge of energy production, satellite imagery of energy storage and produce a much better view of trade flows, which plays well into our aerospace and defense and description of trade flows at sea energy related as well as our ability to better predict supply and demand. ","And so we feel really good Andrew about our investments in incrementally adding to our existing products, which is both defensive but also allows for price increase and incremental service increase. Then there's complete new products where we're stepping back and saying, we've got a large customer base and we are great leveragers of content, how can we apply analytics and data science to create an all new product, a new benchmark that could be used in our index team, a new product offering that we could offer our customers in maritime and trade, a new -- a completely new solution where we're benchmarking new things like the Internet of things. And you mentioned automotiveMastermind Conquest, which is a marriage of automotive with our acquisition asset dealer footprint and equally we've had many innovations of complete new products in CARFAX and CARFAX for Life is being launched in the next week or two and it's one of our most innovative product launches within the CARFAX suite and Dick Raines and his team are extremely excited about those prospects.","So this firm post merger is coming out of tough changes in regulations around processing, tough energy markets, used the merger to create dollars to invest and those are boding well for us to protect our guidance range and the revenues that we\u2019re forecasting. And that, that vitality is something that we measure, we look at. And I think I\u2019ve said before, when we get confidence in the consistency of how we report that, we hope we\u2019re one of those firms that can report vitality out to you with confidence, so you can put that into your view of our guidance as well.","So as said, I think we\u2019ve got a conservative strong 5% to 6% year and we\u2019ve got lots of good things that can help us on the revenue side. But you guys are concerned about revenue, but you\u2019re invested in the firm that also knows how to deliver margins. So I think you\u2019ve got protection both ways. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is open. ","Hamzah Mazari","My question is around just the transaction business or the non-recurring fees. Just any thoughts as to what extent do you think the transaction side is a lead indicator to the subscription side and maybe what you\u2019ve seen across the verticals in past cycles around sort of transaction leading subscription or that\u2019s not the right way to look at it? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","No. I think that\u2019s -- so when you say transaction, if you\u2019re referring to processing, we process a whole bunch of different assets. We process credit derivatives, interest rate derivatives, equity derivatives, FX and loans. So those are the things we process. So rates rising generally means a slowdown for a period of the rise, the volatility in the loan markets. So that will lower the output of our processing and we get paid per trade. So we don\u2019t care about the size of the volume. We just care about the number of transactions and that\u2019s quite a nice business model, because -- the next part of the financial market is the interest rate derivative market, where we\u2019re the biggest player in the marketplace globally covering every single market. And what\u2019s interesting in tough times, interest rate derivatives volatility means lots of small trades. And that bode well. So post \u201808 actually saw positive strong increases. ","So, I look at interest rates in a volatile market, Brexit, trade wars, rising interest rates, building walls, whatever we\u2019re doing, the fact is that interest rate derivatives can have higher volumes. Lack of liquidity in credit markets bodes well for CDX as a hedge, which is our main index. We\u2019ve partnered with ICE on non-exchange contract and we have a full JV with ICE and that bodes well in this environment. Equity derivative, smaller business, it\u2019s probably insignificant in the analysis. ","And then FX has actually been a growth business for us, because we\u2019re a new player coming in, we\u2019re booking up pre and post trade flows for Tier 2 banks and that bodes well in terms of revenue growth and volatility clearly helps FX markets. So that\u2019s why I said today, really when you judge that this year in financial services, take a close look at recurring revenue and see if we\u2019re hitting our goals on recurring. On non-recurring, your guess is as good as mine. I think plus 2%, minus 2% could be an equal guess. And it's a $170 million out of $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in Financial Services. And so, therefore it\u2019s not going to really drive the 4% to 6% or 6% to 8% with Ipreo in Financial Services. ","I have to focus also going back to Andrew Steinerman\u2019s question which was the right one, how's your capital market Ipreo business going to be impacted? Well there is a transactions component in the equity space and that's very subscriptions-oriented, that business. So it's not -- it doesn't have a high kind of plus, minus range but it has a plus, minus range. And if you model it off of the least deals done since 2008 year, we can accept that and we can see the overall picture fitting in within our guidance. ","So that's our view, if you're talking about transactions in the financial markets. Thank you. Next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","George Tong ","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You've reiterated your expectations of low to mid-teens Ipreo revenue growth for the full year. Understanding there's a range of possible outcomes. Can you discuss whether your non-recurring revenue expectations for Ipreo have been overall tempered in light of a moderation in capital market volumes? And if so, what offsetting factors you see in your subscription-based business?","Lance Uggla","Yes, well, it\u2019s really -- the point is the low means less transactions. Keeping in the range and still feeling low to mid is continued growth in private capital market. So those are your two levers. The private capital market growth is the racecar. The transactions, end markets, that\u2019s the kind of steamship and it can be slower or faster. And with the combination of those two, we're happy with low to mid and we're happy with how that feeds into our overall firm guidance because at the end of the day you invest in us for our capabilities of running our four divisions and the diversity across them. And so what I have real strength in today is the 5% to 6% guidance for the firm. And I have -- I always pick my worst case scenario across all the divisions and make sure that it can add up into the circa 5% number and that's how I look at it George and I feel confident in reaffirming that today. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. ","Alex Kramm ","Yes, hey. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to circle back on Financial Services. Lance and Todd, both of you guys highlighted loans in your prepared remarks both in terms of I think more challenges which -- from you Lance which I think is broadly the view out there. And then I think Todd you said solutions was driven by loan. So I guess given some of these uncertainties I went back and I think market at one point said that in 2013 loans made up 20% of market, I assume that's grown faster than the average for market since then. So maybe you can give us an update, how big the loan business has become and then if there are more challenges maybe just outline where those challenges could hit? Because I mean I get it on the processing side but clearly on information and solutions, there's a lot of stuff you do for a lot of different players. Thanks.","Lance Uggla","I can start, you can bring in the financial piece. I'll give you the Markit, Alex. So first of all, Todd didn\u2019t say solutions was driven by loans but there's a piece of our loan business that is services. And that's generally -- that's offered out of our WSO product. It had great -- can I say that it was strong growth last year. And it's kind of AUM driven, CLO issuance, there's a whole lot bunch of things. And so within your own banks, you can look at the CLO space, it's still fairly buoyant and our loan business is diversified across pricing, processing data, reference data, managed services, which is a big growth area, that's us managing the accounting and back-office and then of course our installed customers as well.","So loans is a strong piece of our franchise and of course a much lower percentage of financial markets today than back in the Markit days where we were consolidating all through acquisition a lot of those pieces.","So IT solutions growth which is the word that we talked about circa 10% growth, if you look back to the day, we always called solutions a double-digit grower, expecting 10% to 15% growth with opportunity for that to happen on a recurring basis.","Through a period we flipped to single-digit growth and what I've been most impressed with is the growth back to double-digits and the amount of the financial markets both sell side and buy side that are looking at using service providers more readily to deal with tax, to deal with reg and compliance, KYC, KY3P, outsourcing data management, outsourcing portfolio management, outsourcing the management and corporate actions. And so all of a sudden solutions are right back in vogue. In \u201808 they were in vogue because people had to cut costs. As bank got profitable again, some of them lost a bit of a view on the cost efficiencies. But where I see all our growth coming in the future is the asset managers actually now needing to get a handle on their costs and so a lot of these solutions that we offer are coming into play. So I think that bodes well for the double-digit solutions growth. ","So it's a mix and -- but the mix with hand on my heart best experience over the last 10 years was 4% to 9% and we're saying 4% to 6%. So we just did 6%. Is that right 6%? Yes, so we just did 6% this year. And so what I think 4% to 6% feels really good. That gives us a lot of scope and chance to outperform probably a small percentage chance to be out at the top end, good percentage to be in the middle and a small percentage chance to miss. And that's a great place for us to be able to start the year. ","We're seeing ourselves get started. Todd, cautioned to make sure as you're distributing revenues across the year that you distribute them accordingly and that you build up a bit as we build up our new initiatives in private capital markets back into the year and I think we\u2019re going to do great. And we definitely -- we\u2019ll keep outperforming our peers with our diversified business and how we\u2019re managing it. And Todd, do you want to add anything? ","Todd Hyatt","The only thought I would add. Just three buckets Lance talked about, the loan pricing, think of that as the subscription business, generally very predictable and stable. The loan services to WSO business has actually been -- we\u2019re really servicing mid-office, back-office loan activities, it tends to not be impacted by volumes. And then the loan settlement is really the processing piece. And there we have settlement of both primary and secondary. So, I think that\u2019s certainly the area that would have the highest variability.","Lance Uggla","Good. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","I think I also want to ask about processing. So could you just talk about what the primary drivers of the decline was this quarter? Or was it the slowdown in loan issuance? And was that in line with your expectation and are you still confident that processing will be positive in \u201819? Thank you. ","Todd Hyatt ","As Lance said, there\u2019s some variability in processing that we\u2019re not going to precisely predict. Processing revenue was $63 million in Q4, $64 million in Q3. And when we say it was down, it was down a few million dollars versus prior year. Lance talked about the dynamics in terms of market volatility that actually are a net positive in derivative process. And I think in loan processing, you really look at primary market activities that I think is certainly down over the last couple of months. Secondary activities, probably, generally up. But I think that\u2019s really the dynamic in the processing business. ","Lance Uggla","And really Toni, it was -- I think it\u2019s 3 million was the shift from Q4 last year, Q4 this year. So you had a bit better volume quarter in Q4 given a 5% decline into this year. So, it really -- it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s really processing, it\u2019s a really insignificant lever in terms of delivering our 4% to 6%. It\u2019s a sticky consistent business and it\u2019s top to bottom range. If it\u2019s up 5% or down 5%, you\u2019re talking a total of \u2026","Todd Hyatt ","$12 million.","Lance Uggla","12?","Todd Hyatt ","Yes.","Lance Uggla","$12 million.","Todd Hyatt ","5%.","Lance Uggla","\u2026 across the group. It\u2019s just -- so I really just don\u2019t have a -- no, but I meant that across the division, it\u2019s insignificant. And I broadly affirm, it\u2019s even more insignificant. So, do I believe processing will be down 5% or up 5%? Don\u2019t know. What I think, it could have been down 10%, up 10%? I\u2019d say highly unlikely. So even when I put those numbers on it, it\u2019s kind of -- it\u2019s 1% of the division and it\u2019s negligible in the firm. So that\u2019s my view. But we\u2019re the most sticky consistent global player with great customer base, great team and a good business, it's just doesn\u2019t have a lot of growth expectations to it. But we always smile when it does grow at 5% to 10%, we go \u201cThat\u2019s kind of wind in our sails that we didn't know.\u201d And most of it goes to the bottom-line if not all of it. So that's how I look at next year. Next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. ","Jeff Silber ","Thanks so much. I know it's late, just one quick question. There's a lot of I guess uncertainty regarding the government shutdown. Can you just remind us, do you have any direct exposure to federal government revenues and in which segment it is? And from an indirect perspective, do you see that having any impact on your business? Thanks. ","Todd Hyatt ","Yes, the biggest area would be product design where we provide service for the army, navy. Typically the contracting process is a continuing resolution process. So ultimately the funding does seem to come in. But there's a continuation of services and ability to recover the full revenue, assuming that ultimately we do get funded. And then it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t have off the top of my head, I don't know the percent, but I would say within product design probably less than 10% to 15%. ","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Todd. Next question? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Ashish Sabadra ","Thanks. Solid results and pretty good margin expansion in the quarter. My question was just on the Transportation margins. You called out the recall and marketing spend for CARFAX and there are a number of products that you launched. Just wondering if you can talk about the margin profile in that business going forward? ","Todd Hyatt ","Well, I talked about this earlier. I mean in transport we have invested at some level. We do have the ability to drive forward margin growth. It is an area that will continue to balance the level of investment with margin delivery. In the quarter we did have some outsized investment activities that I talked about earlier and a little bit heavier on the recall which tends to be lower margin. But there certainly wasn't anything in the margin within transport that caused this concern in the quarter. ","Lance Uggla","Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. ","Joseph Foresi ","Hi. I know it's late, so I guess I'll ask the token capital allocation question. I know you suspended the share buyback. What does the debt paydown schedule look like this year? What's available on the acquisition side? And any thoughts about that share buyback? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt ","We see ourselves getting below the 3 times in Q3. We talked about that at the time of the Ipreo acquisition. We've made good progress on cash and we see below 3 times by the time we exit Q3.","I think relative to acquisition activity, Lance talked about this earlier, we see continue to do very small bolt-ons. But in terms of capital allocation for this year it will be directed primarily at the buyback and delivering to the $500 million full year commitment that we talked about in November. ","Lance Uggla","Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from the phone lines.

[Operator Instructions] Pleased be advised that today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion of the quarter includes non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other items. IHS Markit believes its non-GAAP results are useful to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Please refer to our earnings release on our website for definitions of the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and in the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thank you, Eric. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. Today, I'll talk to the highlight to the quarter and then provide an update to our capital allocation framework, which looks to return more capital to shareholders through continued share repurchases and our intent to initiate a quarterly dividend pending board approval. Included in our capital allocation section, we'll also discuss the divestiture of our aerospace and defense business, which we have agreed to sell subject to regulatory approval.","So now turning to the quarter. I was extremely pleased with Q3 as our teams delivered another strong quarter of diversified revenue growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow. We also de-levered to within our target range and completed our promise repurchase of 500 million of shares in early Q4. Finally, we closed the asset exchange with Informa and have already achieved early revenue synergies. So some key financial highlights to the quarter. Revenue of $1.112 billion, that's up 6% on an organic basis and 11% overall. Continued solid performance across our three scaled verticals, transportation, financial services and resources.","Adjusted EBITDA of $453 million and margin of 40.7% which is up a 170 basis points year-over-year. And finally adjusted EPS of $0.67, up 16% over the prior year. ","Now let me provide some segment highlights. Transportation performed within our range of high single digits with organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter. It's notable to point out that the recurring fixed remained very strong at 10%, offset by lower margin, non-recurring growth and some impacted continued weakness within digital advertising as expected. We also have slower low margin recall activities. The automotive highlights in the quarter to shout out for performance include our CARFAX used-car listings driven by investments in search optimization driving market share gains which we expect to continue. ","Our Carfax for life launch met early targets with over 1,100 unique dealers signed up to date. Our powertrain and appliance offerings rising on increased regulatory demands. And finally automotive mastermind benefiting from the first half launch of two additional automotive brands and ongoing enhancements in our product offering, which now leverages many of our proprietary automotive data sets.","Let's move on to financial services where we reported 6% organic growth with several notable areas to call out. Our pricing and index businesses each with double-digit growth on the back of recent investments. Derivatives processing return to growth in the quarter. Our corporate actions and EDM software sales continued their strong growth trajectories. And finally Ipreo had a strong overall quarter with significant growth in private markets, corporate solutions and municipal issuance. After a tough start to the year due to market conditions, we're now performing more in line with our acquisition target level on a run rate basis which I'm particularly pleased about.","In Resources, we delivered another solid quarter with 6% organic growth anchored by stable recurring revenue growth and strong non-recurring revenue growth. Strong performers in the quarter included our downstream pricing business, Opus, as well as our chemical business. Our upstream business continued its steady performance. We continue to make progress with recent investments in analytics and partnerships to extend our leading data and insight capabilities into new revenue streams.","We made headway on our integration of the agribusiness acquisition with our chemical and downstream businesses. This integration will build upon our existing data, pricing insight, forecasting and news services within our resources segment.","Agriculture is the largest chemical end market in the world and this transaction expands our capabilities into fertilizers and chemical crop protection. We'll expanding our capabilities and biofuels. Finally, I'd like to call out a great example of our market leadership and capabilities in the wake of the recent Saudi Arabia oil field attack. On the Monday following the weekend of the attack, our resources team hosted a webinar which pulled together our experts across upstream, downstream and economic and country risk to brief our customers on the potential implications.","Over 1,700 clients joined live with over 600 of those coming from the financial services. Really great work by the team being able to pull together such a comprehensive brief in a short period of time to help our customers both corporates and financial market participants better understand. ","Moving on to CMS, organic revenue growth was 5% benefiting from the biennial boil pressure vessel code. We continue to expect CMS organic growth to be in the low single digits for the year in line with our forecast. Park design, the largest business within CMS continued to perform well with organic revenue growth of 4%. Finally, I want to give an update to our capital allocation framework as we've completed our de-levering post the Ipreo acquisition. ","Our targeted leverage range is going to remain 2x to 3x on a gross basis and will tend to operate the higher end of the range. We will target an annual capital return to shareholders of a minimum 50% and as much as 75% of our annual, capital capacity through a combination of share buybacks and a cash dividend. At our October board meeting, I tend to recommend, our intend to recommend the board approve a new share buyback reauthorization and a quarterly dividend program beginning in Q1, 2020 with an initial 1% dividend yield target.","We believe 2020 is the right timing for the initiation of a dividend for the following reasons. First, it'll be over three years since the successful merger of IHS and Markit. And we have confidence in our ability to continue to operate within our longer-term annual financial framework, including 5% to 7% organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. We believe this framework balances the right level of investment and margin expansion to continue to maintain our organic growth range.","Second, our business model generate ample free cash flow for both capital returns and M&A. Third, we have reduced our legacy market optional overhang to now approximately $10 million outstanding options at the end of Q3. And fourth, we believe initiating a dividend is a great way to diversify our capital return discipline and to broaden the potential groups of shareholders that may be interested in IHS Markit.","Now in terms of M&A, we will be focused on deploying capital within our scaled, focus areas including financial services, resources and automotive. Sizing of potential deals will fit within our updated capital allocation framework, will also continue to evaluate opportunities to further rationalize our portfolios which could provide incremental capital flexibility. With that said, we've entered into a letter of intent to sell our Aerospace and Defense for $470 million to Montagu.","We believe this is the right long-term move for us. Our shareholders and our aerospace and defense colleagues. The combination of these points around capital allocation gives us a clear framework to operate within to meet our financial objectives. It provides our shareholders of at least approximately $800 million of capital return annually and our divisions' ample acquisition capital to support our longer-term financial targets.","And with this, I'll turn the call back over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Our Q3 results were in line with our expectations and included revenue of $1.112 billion, an increase of 11% and organic growth of 6.%. Net income of 439 million and GAAP EPS of $0.10. Adjusted EBITDA of $453 million, an increase of 16% with margin of 40.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.67, an increase of $0.09 or 16%. Relative to revenue, our Q3 organic revenue growth of 6% included recurring organic of 6% and non-recurring organic of 4%.","Looking at segment performance, Transportation revenue growth was 6% including organic revenue growth of 7% and negative 1% FX. Organic growth was comprised of 10% recurring and flat non -recurring. We expect recurring to continue to perform at the upper end of our high single digit organic growth range. Non- recurring was impacted by lower recall and lower digital marketing. We expect non-recurring to continue to perform at a lower level than recurring due to revenue reductions primarily in our lower margin recall business.","Resources revenue growth was 9%, including 6% organic and 3% acquisitive. The organic revenue increase was comprised of 5% recurring and 15% non-recurring. Non-recurring benefited in part from continued strength in our software business. Our Q3 organic ACB increased $10 million and our trailing 12-months organic ACB increased $28 million to $757 million, which was up 4% versus prior year. CMS revenue increased 1%, including 5% organic, negative 4% from divestiture and negative 1% FX. Recurring organic was flat and non-recurring organic increased to $8 million or 41% All in a non-recurring organic benefited from the BPVC release, which contributed $8 million organic growth in the quarter.","Within the segment, our Product Design, core specs and standards business continue to perform well with recurring organic growth of 4%. Financial services revenue growth was 21% including 6% organic, 16% acquisitive and negative 1% FX. Recurring organic was 74% and non-recurring organic declined $4 million or negative 15%. Recurring revenue partially benefited from revenue catch up on past few renewals. Non-recurring decline was primarily due to lower enterprise software revenue.","Our Information business organic growth was 6% due primarily to strong growth in our core pricing and index businesses. Processing organic was flat; derivative processing was up but it was offset by decline in our loans processing business. Solutions organic growth was 4% led primarily by our EDM and corporate actions businesses. Ipreo revenue increased to $89 million and included one-month organic revenue contribution in the quarter.","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $453 million, up $62 million or 16% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.7%, up a 170 basis points on a reported basis and up a 100 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA a margin was 40.3% which was up a 130 basis points on a reported basis and up a 100 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX. We continue to track to our 10 basis points full-year normalized margin expansion but expect an increased level of one-time investment in Q4.","Regarding segment profitability, Transportations adjusted EBITDA was $134 million with margin of 42.6%, down 50 basis points. Resources adjusted EBITDA was a $101 million with margin of 43.8%, up 360 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $31 million with margin of 22.4%, up 30 basis points. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $199 million with margin of 46.4 %, up 240 basis points normalized for Ipreo and on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.67 per diluted share, a $0.09 or 16% improvement. Our adjusted EPS excluded a $200 million one-time GAAP tax expense related to tax reform and also excluded a one-time gain of a $112 million related to the sale of our TMT business.","Our GAAP tax rate was 86% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. Our GAAP tax included $200 million expense related to Treasury regulations issued in June 2019 that changed retroactive to fiscal year 2018 certain pre US tax reform deferral rules. We expect a favorable offsetting $50 million GAAP tax adjustment in Q4 resulting in a net 2019 GAAP tax expense increase of $150 million.","We have excluded this one time GAAP tax expense from our adjusted tax expense. This one time GAAP tax expense essentially offsets 2018 one-time GAAP tax benefit of $141 million related to tax reform, which was also excluded from our adjusted tax expense. This change will not impact our going forward effective tax rate and in future years we continue to expect a low-teens GAAP tax rate and an adjusted tax rate of 18% to 20%. ","Cash tax owed from this rule change is approximately $90 million which will be paid in Q4 of 2019. Despite the negative cash impact in 2019, tax reform has been an overall net positive to the company. Our Q3 free cash flow was $343 million and our trailing 12-months free cash flow was $1.129 billion and represented a conversion rate of 65%. On a full-year basis, our cash conversion will be negatively impacted by approximately five points due to the one-time Q4 tax payment of $90 million.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our quarter end debt balance was $5.05 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.9x on a bank covenant basis. In the quarter, we completed a $350 million add-on to our 10-year April 2020 bonds at an effective interest rate of 3.25%. We closed the quarter with a $124 million of cash and our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.6 billion. In Q3, we completed a $200 million ASR and we executed a further $300 million ASR in Q4. Our Q3 weighted average diluted share account was 410.9 million shares.","In terms of portfolio activities, we closed the acquisition of Informa's agriculture business on June 30th and we also closed the sale of a majority of our TMT market intelligence business to Informa on August 1st. As a result of the exchange, our annual CMS revenue will decline by approximately $60 million, while our annual resources revenue will increase by $40 million. The exchange is slightly diluted to adjusted EBITDA and neutral to adjusted EPS.","Finally, as Lance said, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our A&B business to Montagu for $470 million. The purchase price represents an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 14x to 15x on a business with approximately 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. We expect net after-tax cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $440 million. The transaction will result in $0.03 of forward adjusted EPS dilution. We will use proceeds from the disposition to reduce leverage which will provide us with further capital structure flexibility as we execute against our new capital allocation framework.","In regard to our new capital allocation framework, as Lance said, we will target capital return to shareholders of 50% to 75% of our annual capital capacity through a combination of share buybacks and dividend. We define capital capacity as our annual free cash flow plus the additional capacity generated by adjusted EBITDA growth. We are updating our prior guidance to provide for revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.42 billion which includes full-year organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%. Absolute revenue is lower than prior guidance range due primarily to higher drag from FX as we expect full-year negative FX impact at $35 million. And also due to the anticipated lower revenue from the TMP AG asset swap.","Adjusted EBITDA tracking above midpoint of prior guidance range of $1.75 billion to $1.78 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of a 100 basis points on reported basis and also normalized for FX and Ipreo. Adjusted EPS at the high end of our prior guidance range of $2.52 to $2.57. We have updated guidance items between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in our supplemental materials.","Finally, we expect cash conversion of approximately 60% due to the one-time tax payment in Q4. We will provide detailed 2020 guidance in November. However, this time we expect to deliver to our double-digit adjusted EPS growth target taking into account expected dilution from the AMD divestiture. In addition to double-digit adjusted EPS growth, we will see additional TSR benefit from our dividend initiation in 2020. ","And with that I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. So in conclusion another strong quarter, an updated capital allocation framework to increase transparency and capital return to shareholders. An updated guidance that puts us in a position for a very strong year. We appreciate your continued support and are pleased that so many of you have trusted us in executing post merger and beyond. Operator, we're ready to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","ManavPatnaik","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the new capital allocation framework. Maybe just to follow up on the aerospace and defense sale. I was wondering if you could just walk through the rationale and why you picked that. They obviously have really good margins. Can you maybe talk about the growth, fit? And just want to clarify like, is Jane's basically all of Aerospace and Defense? Or did more than that go in this deal?","LanceUggla","So it's just aerospace and defense. And I guess when we look at transportation in IHS Markit, there are three major components. So there's automotive, maritime and aerospace and defense. And when you look at the big synergies, revenue synergies areas to invest, areas to grow across the group automotive and maritime fit as or not just transportation but across energy and into financial markets. Whereas aerospace and defense stood alone, it had a slight overlap with our economic and country risk business, but in terms of forward investment and commitment to invest further, it fell outside of our capital allocation. And therefore made sense for divestiture. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","GaryBisbee","Hey, guys. Good morning. Could you just give a little more color on the non-recurring revenue weakness at both the financial services and transportation business? Just what really drove that and should that can -- are the reasons those factors would continue going forward? Thank you.","LanceUggla","Okay. Maybe I'll start and then I'll pass to Todd. So I guess I don't see financial weakness in either division. So I know when you look in dissect numbers, if you take transportation for example the big driver there being automotive. And when you look at automotive, you've got 10% recurring, outstanding performance across the group, well diversified all sectors across the group. When you look at the non-recurring piece, you really have two-- you have about $600 million of non-recurring to consider across the whole group. About 20% of that is recall and a big piece of recall is lower margin where we're doing recall indirect to the OEMs. And if they're defined as we look to expand margins and look at our mix, our business around recall, we want to do more direct activity with the OEMs, which is higher margin and suits our overall business best. And a little bit less of the indirect business.","We also had which we called out for several quarters now a bit of a slowdown in the digital advertising side. And so those coupled together in the quarter for the slight decline in recurring, or sorry, in non-recurring. But in terms of the margin EBITDA and our forward growth profile nothing's changed on transportation. Very pleased with the growth and diversification of it. Financial markets, I would have to say had a real strong quarter, but there's always lots of things within a quarter. We, previous quarter, we had a large software sale that shows up that bodes well for a piece of revenue. This quarter, we've got Ipreo firing on all cylinders that definitely helped and came into play a little bit.","We really, it's mixed EDM and corporate actions super strong. But even some of the soft grass that haven't grown quarter-over-quarter all are performing within expectations. So I think the message here is you should have no change in your forward outlook for any of our three scale verticals. They're all operating exactly as we say each quarter, don't see anything to change. We generally move the guidance up a little bit around at least the mid top brands of EBITDA, upper ends of EPS and really the revenue we had to give up some revenue on the TBT, TMG Agri swap and we've got $35 million of FX. ","So when I look at it all, I think this is the best quarter since post merger in terms of strong diversified teams executing really well. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","BillWarmington","Good morning, everyone. So I had a question about the particularly strong performance at Ipreo at 22%. Was there --was something there in the timing or with deferred revenue that made that particularly strong? I just wanted to try to get an apples-to-apples number there. And the reason is I'm just trying to get to a kind of a steady state ongoing organic revenue growth rate.","LanceUggla","Yes, go ahead Todd. ","ToddHyatt","Yes. Ipreo contributed $5 million of organic in the quarter. It had a very good quarter. The quarter was in a teen's growth. We had one month of organic and it had a particularly strong last month of the quarter. I think when we've talked about Ipreo, we talked about a double-digit growth, so wouldn't expect all in of 22% although I think PCM is performing very high toward that high teens into the 20s level, but Ipreo certainly we expect to be a double-digit grower going forward, Bill. ","LanceUggla","Thanks Todd. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open,","AndrewSteinerman","Hi. I know you've already mentioned that the resources ACV are trending up 4%. Could you just talk a little bit more about the energy backdrop right now? Is it conducive for acceleration? And I note that resources subs growth at 5% is above the ACV growth at 4%.","LanceUggla","Right. Well, I think in all our divisions and I know in resources, volatile energy prices makes many think that there should be more volatility within IHS Markit. The same is stars in automotive and I think for three years I've said I don't personally spend a lot of time focusing on a particular indicator to drive our overall performance. So what are we doing. We're doing consulting. It's a piece of the business that actually in the quarter outperformed if anything and on that side its teams advising people that are making decisions in volatile markets. And volatile prices that they're interested in should they lend to a project shouldn't they? Should they buy an asset shouldn't they? ","Are there -- do we have information in and around the energy market that can help people better model supply and demand. And I'd say that the new data science and analytics around coupled with consulting give us some really good market fundamentals around us. Not that I think we're going to be north double-digits north of 10%, but I do think that we have a solid business that supports mid-single digits. And the other thing I would say is as you go in volatile markets the downstream pricing and news of all these refined products having daily prices, weekly forecasts, monthly reporting and insights, it really is a place where IHS Markit has had and continues to support high, mid to upper single digits growth and that's around Opus. It's the new agribusiness. So it's downstream chemicals into agriculture.","It's our chemicals business itself and all the inputs into various supply chains. We really do have a strong position and then you add renewables on top of that which is a growth segment all around clean tech that we're playing into. So I really think it's a great mix and the only piece where I look at over the last five years where there's out or under performance is taking our core few hundred million so 30% of the division pure data assets that supports the overall division. And I would say that is where you get a bit of this volatility, but the division operating and being managed effectively can more than support flat to up five or even down five on that $300 million. And that's how I look at it, Andrew.","So I think that volatilities, our friend in terms of advice but it can take away some of the desire to explore and expand and do international projects. But we have more than enough skin in the game in the - in this big marketplace to support mid-single digits growth. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","AndrewJeffrey","Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. A little bit of a hypothetical I guess for you Lance, but pertinent, I think timely, regardless. I know complexity in auto sort of generally aids your growth and demand for your services. I wonder if you think about what's happening in the US this sort of battle around emissions and the deal the California cut with four major auto manufacturers sort of a side deal to federal definitely changing federal emissions laws. Can you talk about how that might affect your auto business, if you have sort of two major US markets?","LanceUggla","Right. Well, we are --actually our advisory around regulatory reporting in automotive actually has quite a good quarter not purely because of that just because of our position there. But also have our head of automotive here with me today in the room Edouard Tavernier. So I'll let him jump in on the question that you asked specifically. Edouard?","EdouardTavernier","Great. Thank you, Lance. And generally the short answer to your question is regulatory uncertainty creates risk for our customers and that creates demand for our services, demand for data and demand for a lot of advisory we can provide around scenario planning and simulation. So generally speaking tough environment for customers, but we can help them through this uncertainty.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","KevinMcVeigh","Great. Thanks. Hey, congratulations on the asset sales. I guess two things, is the aerospace and defense, is the sale in the guidance or is that something that will be adjusted going forward? And then just it sounds like, Lance, you're taking a more focused view across the scaled verticals. Does that imply anything for the remaining CMS business or how should we think about that within the context of scaling up? Obviously, with three real nice assets.","LanceUggla","Okay. I'll let talk Todd do the guidance after I just talked about the divestiture. So, yes, very focused. I have to say very focused on our automotive, financial markets and energy related scaled verticals. Those are the very large verticals of the firm. And they're the ones that we are strategically investing in terms of --for organic growth putting capital to work. We have a lot of data science analytics and investment into each of those areas and we made both on acquisition that we think are effective in supporting our longer-term growth targets and supporting our customers.","So within CMS, we have divested the very -- the non core portion of TMT. And we've now divested AD&S from transportation. And so one thing I did call out today is that we'll continue to look within this capital allocation framework at potential other divestiture. And I guess what I want to say to both shareholders and the employees inside the firm that this has to be a very thoughtful process. We have to think about the overall long-term potential for our firm. But we're not going to make short-term decisions that are careless or reckless rather we're going to invest in the assets, the people of the assets that we may think are non core. And we'll look for opportunities to make different business decisions going forward. And we're not afraid of analyzing our own portfolio. It's the backdrop of many acquisitions over many years. And where we want to know that we win every day is in the scaled verticals that we're building for long-term. And outside of that we've got to take a very careful respectful approach to our assets, our shareholders, our customers and our people.","But there's no lack of strategic thought from myself or my management team. Todd, do you want to add on the guidance side?","ToddHyatt","Yes. The disposition of A&D is not included in the guidance. It has enclosed and subject to regulatory filings and approvals. I did provide I think sufficient information [Tech Difficulty] in terms of the revenue EBITDA and forward adjusted EPS and certainly as we guide in 2020, we will be very clear on the impacts that are embedded or have been adjusted out of the 2020 guide for A&D.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","AlexKramm","Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully I'm not repeating anything, but I was hoping that you can just flush out the capital return a little bit more. So bear with me for a second, so if I hear you correctly and I do my math right, the dividend is now basically 25% of your free cash flow. And you've got another 25 to 50 for share buyback and another 25% or so for whatever M&A et cetera. So I was just wondering the buyback I guess it's a low end of the buyback to 25%. Is that guaranteed or for the right deal you would say like alright buybacks we can certainly forego for a year or so if we need to or does everything have to come out of new leverage and I guess the percentage of the buyback. ","And then also, Todd, very quickly you said using the proceeds with de-leveraging, I guess the question is why it seems like you're kind of like a net range now. So why do you choose de-leveraging for the incremental and could you go to a 100% capital return in a year as well is the last one. Sorry for the loaded question.","LanceUggla","Yes. Go ahead, Todd, if you want to start and I can always add.","ToddHyatt","Just for size, the capital capacity of the company and the capital return element. So when I think about it, we have circa annual cash flow of call it $1.250 billion a year and then we have additional capacity that we generate from adjusted EBITDA growth. So you can take the EBITDA growth and the leverage ratio the 3x and called out $400 million. So essentially the baseline capital is a $1.6 billion. And we've said 50% of that will go to capital return at a minimum up to 75%. So in terms of the allocation between dividend and buyback at a 1% dividend yield, we would think of that as a $275 million annual dividend and that leaves a minimum of $525 million -$550 million of share buyback. So that would be the baseline minimum capital return that we will execute on an annual basis.","As far as additional cash like from the A&D\/ Jane's disposition, we would expect that that capital would be available from a strategic perspective to potentially acquire other assets. And so that's why we're in the near term going to bring leverage down a bit to have a little bit of dry powder. But ultimately as Lance said in his opening comment, we're going to run the company in the high 2s. And so if we don't have opportunity to deploy that capital, we would then look at increasing the level of the buyback above the $500 million to $525 million level.","LanceUggla","Yes. I think that was it. So thanks Todd. That's -- so I think it's really important for us we've listened to our shareholders over the past three years. And defining a capital framework that was completely happy to provide to you and be transparent with. And then live within the guideline is what we've done today. And so you've got the minimum levels and then from that we'll adjust on the annual basis based on the best remaining opportunity for us as a firm. Let's go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","JeffreySilber","Thanks so much. You had talked earlier about the impact of volatility I believe in your energy business. I'm wondering with everything that's been going on in the overall markets, what have you seen on the financial services side? Is that impacting maybe some buying decisions going forward? Thanks.","LanceUggla","So are you're referring to private equity advice that we may provide to private equity that may be investing in energy related assets? Is that -- was that your question?","JeffreySilber","I was interested more in the financial services vertical.","LanceUggla","Okay. So but financial services with respect to our advising and selling them energy related products or just overall in financial services.","JeffreySilber","The latter if possible, but if you want to give a little bit on the former as well that would be great.","LanceUggla","Okay. So I do find financial services a growth ever since the merger, it's one of those revenue synergies that's been a growth driver for us. And it's really coming from twofold. One, we have the financial services customers that I just standalone didn't have deeper relationship. So we're definitely having that wind on our back in terms of opening doors and participating. The second thing I'd say is private equity has been very active in terms of investments in and around the energy market. Third, I'd say that when you look at growth and renewables and solar, wind et cetera. And you look at the investment profile and where the investments are coming in those projects.","A lot of them are being driven out of the financial markets and private equities playing a big role in terms of investing. So we have some really nice growth parameters coming from our relationship with financial markets. And then to the investments whether it was in the Permian, but now in terms of the whole renewable space where we've got expertise to help on the advisory and on the subscription data sides in those non fossil fuel related areas. So that's been good for us. Volatility in energy means our financial market clients want more information and support. That's also good for us. Overall, what I would say in financial markets is the last few quarters and Ipreo is a great bellwether for it is that you see first off what you see is there's been fairly buoyant equity market issuance.","And if you look at Ipreo and you go where does Ipreo have volume related or transaction related non-recurring upside, it's around equity market issuance. That's been very good. Lower interest rates also encouraging municipals to get out there and walk in and we've seen a large issuance of municipal bonds and we've been hitting some record numbers there. And then finally, I called out derivatives processing and whenever there's volatility in FX or rates, you get volatility in and around the processing and activities of derivatives not that there's more total dollar value, but there's more transactions. A lot of times they're smaller and we've seen some increased activity there.","So net -net, I think that the financial markets and the general geopolitics and global dynamics around the markets we are in have been good for an information company that had a lot of quantity, quality and different types of data to offer to our customers. So I think it bodes well for us and it's been quite a diversified quarter that I'm particularly pleased about. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","ShlomoRosenbaum","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to ask a little bit about the divestitures in the portfolio positioning that you guys have been doing a good job of. Could you discuss how fast the A&D business had been growing revenue wise? And then in a similar vein can you talk a little bit about the components of what's left at CMS and how fast they've been growing?","LanceUggla","Okay. So aerospace and defense has been a low to mid single-digit grower with good margin and a super strong brand position with super strong engaged employees in that business. And what's great about it really is Jane's is one of these 100-year-old brands that has people that are just passionate about defense, military spend, new weaponry and we really do have kind of industry experts in around that asset. But it needs to grow and it has potential to grow at upper single digits even double digits with increased investment and the home for that at Montagu is a better home than with us. Because if I look at our investments priorities across the whole group, I'm looking at where we have our scaled verticals, but then also how do those scaled verticals with data science and analytics play across each other into our financial market participants.","And automotive and energy are two huge asset classes that financial markets invest in private equity, bank lending, insurance, asset and index inclusion or exclusion. And we have just so much to offer where as aerospace and defense is just -- it just plays a much more specialized smaller role. And we don't get the same leverage across the group. Therefore, we classified it as non core and we decided several months back to look at the divestiture. We did similar when we took the piece of TMT and did the Informa swap and that worked out very, very well.","So here we have two thoughtful divestitures with a lot of care around our teams in our group. And we think the homes are better for them where they are. When you get into other assets and I get asked this question regularly and because CMS is less scaled than the others, of course, it's always on the question board in terms of shareholders. And all is I can say is if I made a divestiture in another piece of the company, it could be a year, it could be two years, could be five years, could be never. What I will promise you is that well we're managing our assets. They're going to be properly managed, properly care for.","We're going to focus on the margin. We're going to focus on the people. We're going to pair people well, look after them well, serve our customers that have served in those markets for many, many years. And if there's an opportunity for a divestiture that makes sense, we're --I hope you can see we're not afraid of divesting an asset if all the right pieces come together. And all's I can say is on aerospace and defense and the TMT swap, those pieces did come together and therefore we were able to execute. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","AshishSabadra","Hi, good morning. We saw some pretty robust margin expansion both in financial and resources. You also talked about some one-time investment in the fourth quarter. Can you just provide some more color on those investments? And then maybe just going forward the margin profile has been trending much better, can you just talk about the potential for better margins going forward? Thanks. ","LanceUggla","Right. Well, I'll start and Todd if I leave some note. I guess I just want to really once again just put the line in the sand. 100 basis points since we merged, we've been operating off of a 100 basis points of margin expansion. And that's both an internal discipline and an external promise. So that's what we've made. The discipline is for our teams to grow at 5% to 7% and half of that 100 basis points will come from revenue growth. And the other half has to come from them organizing their strategy accordingly. And we feel that we can move to mid-40s margins over the next four or five years. Many occasions, our teams outperform the 100 basis points margin. But what my motivation to my internal team is deliver the discipline for the 100 and improve your investment capacity above that. And that's the mantra, that's how we run the firm. That's how all our teams operate. It works very well and I think it's a fair distribution of our efforts to shareholders and our teams in terms of reinvestment. And that's how we run the firm. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","GeorgeTong","Hi, thanks, good morning. Your guidance for a free cash flow conversion from EBITDA was updated from mid 60s to 60%. Can you discuss why your free cash flow expectations are more muted now?","LanceUggla","Todd, you want to add that. ","ToddHyatt","Yes. I talked about this on the call. That's the one-time tax payment of $90 million in Q4 will reduce conversion by five points. We don't see an impact on the forward conversion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","DrewKootman","This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. Just curious if you could talk about the acquisition pipeline? And if you're seeing plenty of opportunities still out there.","LanceUggla","Well, there's lots -- there's, yes, it's always lots of opportunities not necessarily priced where we would be able to make them work in terms of our own return on invested capital. So it's interesting as we, I would say the year after our merger we had lots of work to focus on integration. As we went into year two, we saw lots of, lots of places where we had gaps in our strategy as we look forward in our scales verticals. And we made a few acquisitions. I would say right now we're in the strongest point we've ever been to support consistently our organic growth targets. And I don't ever wake up and feel there's something we have to do. Where at the time of the merger, we all felt as a team that we had some gaps around alternatives, around being on the dealer floor, around expanding and diversifying downstream our energy and natural resources.","And I think we've done an excellent job of filling those gaps, broadening the diversification and consistently delivering the organic growth we say we're going to do. And I think if I look forward, I just feel really comfort in that mid-single digit revenue growth. And how I think on this. I sometimes-- I wouldn't be upset if we're at four and I wouldn't be bragging if we were at eight or nine. My view is we've got a strong support, very diversified for five to seven. And I think we can consistently deliver that for the next several years. High single digits autos, mid-single digits energy and mid-to-upper now in financial markets with the alternatives in Ipreo piece of a puzzle.","So that makes me feel pretty confident that we don't have to do a lot of acquisitions. But I like the fact that we have $500 to $750 million in potential acquisition capital in the framework. And we're going to analyze those bolt-on acquisitions on a regular basis. We're going to be in the know. We're going to know what's going on. If we divest, we'll create additional capital and then we'll either move to the upper end of our capital allocation framework buyback. We may delever short term for an opportunity we see forward, but expect discipline, expect the framework to be in place. And we are -- I think we're in a really good position to focus on our scale verticals and grow those accordingly. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","ToniKaplan","Thanks so much. For transportation, you mentioned the digital advertising slowdown and just wondering if you view that as temporary and how you see that playing out should it be a drag for a couple quarters more or are we largely done and really what's sort of going to change to fix it? Thank you.","LanceUggla","Well, it's a good question, Toni. I kind of and Edouard here with me today so it's when we talk about regularly. We have a strategy in digital marketing that was very aligned to the social media platforms. Facebook, Pinterest, Google et cetera. And our teams did a great job and it gave us a strong growth lever for the last several years. On the back of the Cambridge Analytica and some of the changes, having the middleman type relationship into the social media platforms is one that has had a complete readjustment. And so we've had to check back and then start to grow again.","My view along with the automotive team is that the use of building audiences from comprehensive registration data. And we have the most comprehensive data of anybody. Couple that with our CARFAX assets and our Mastermind assets, we really-- we have all the ingredients to cook up the best audience for the best strategy and campaign in the marketplace. And so my personal view which is shared by Edouard and he may want to add this in a moment is that this is a growth driver long term. And we're well positioned to go after that growth. But we've now had three, four quarters of that realignment of your strategy to change how you position and enter into the social media arena. But we do, if you take our audiences versus an audience built purely from social media without registration data, a more based on taste and preferences of search, we outperformed that 50% to 100%.","So we are very, very strong and no reason we shouldn't grow. And I can't wait to get on the call and say automotive had a super strong quarter on the back of digital marketing. I just haven't -- we haven't been able to say it for three quarters. And you're right to call it out. Edouard, you want to add?","EdouardTavernier","Nothing really to add other than we have the best audiences. Our customers know we have the best audiences, but we are pivoting our business model and the way we monetize those audiences. And that's taking a few quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.","TrevorRomeo","Hi. Good morning. It's actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. Thank you for taking our questions. I think, Lance, you mentioned that you've already seen some early revenue synergies from the agribusiness group. Can you just give us a sense of the initial customer response there and more detail on what's driving those synergies? Thanks.","LanceUggla","Yes. So it's really the-- as you go down into the agricultural business, of course, it's the refined chemical products that are feeding into the customer base. And what we found, some of the really --like I'm talking within days of our teams coming together and visiting customers with us being able to build out a couple really interesting chemical-based consulting projects from customers of the acquired company and ourselves. And so I see a lot more of that as we look forward. Again like us selling AD&S or selling our non-core TMT, us receiving the agribusiness from Informa, it's the same thing it was non core to them. So all of a sudden they're inside a firm that has customers that look like their customers, which is exciting to people that talk their lingo chemicals, phosphates and potash and all the feedstock into agricultural products. Biofuels, you've got consultants in the space, you've got researchers and you've got people that know how to price and build benchmarks and indices.","So it just is the enthusiasm of the marriage of the assets and therefore the customer base that we are visiting together. And so the teams had some really nice early wins. And I wanted to call them out on the call. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Vafi with Canaccord. Your line is open.","JosephVafi","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that Agri business here. I mean, obviously, there's a good synergy on the chemical side. It's a relatively small business now for you but a very large industry. You guys -- does this acquisition provide the capability that perhaps over invest in this area and move into areas such as commodities and other things away from chemicals and more on the output side rather than the input side? Thanks. ","LanceUggla","Right. No, good question and exactly what we're thinking when we did this asset swap is that if you think of agriculture as a world need and then you look at the need for the fertilizers crop protection, the resultant biofuels et cetera. This is a big, big TAM. And so when we modeled out the TAM for the agribusiness, it was substantively larger. We've taken in a business with approximately $40 million of revenues. And so I think if you -- if you're-- if we're sitting here in three to five years and we don't have more than $100 million, I'd be really --I'd be disappointed that we didn't invest. We didn't build the revenue synergies. We didn't take the power of our global positions and apply it to agriculture. ","Because for a company to earn a $100 million in revenue out of $4 billion - $5 billion revenues in agriculture it just seems really small for the TAM. So I'm with you, feed our capabilities from upstream mid to downstream products into agriculture, and make sure we're capturing all the inputs, benchmarks, signals, factors supply and demand characteristics of all the inputs and outputs. I think there's a lot for us to do there. And it's a big market. So we have high hopes. It's not, I can say that that's just in the mid single-digit forecast of our $1 billion energy business. ","But it is definitely a bright spot that we think should be upper single digits to double digits in the early years of post acquisition. Next question.","End of Q&A","Operator","And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time.

Earlier this morning, we issued our Q2 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations Web-site.","Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other items. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS Markit believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and Webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit.

With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Eric, and our thanks to all of you for joining the IHS Markit Q2 Earnings Call. We will review our Q2 results, provide you with an update on our integration work, and discuss some of the other highlights from the quarter.","We were very pleased with all that we accomplished in Q2 as we produced solid financial performance, continued to make progress with our integration, and hosted our first Investor Day as IHS Markit. It was great to see many of you at our Investor Day. The team did an outstanding job of laying out why we feel so confident in the long-term outlook for IHS Markit.","As Lance described so well, the combination of our unique information assets and industry expertise puts us in an unparalleled position to benefit from our customers' increasing need for actionable intelligence in the years to come. We will best position ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity through the incremental investments we discussed at our Investor day. These investments are made possible by the ongoing efforts of our team delivering the merger synergies. We look forward to updating you on these investments over time.","Now let's move to the high-level financial results in Q2 and then Lance will provide the industry highlights and integration update. Revenue was $906 million, up 3% year-over-year, on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $353 million, in margins of 38.9%, representing an expansion of 480 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.52, up 16% over the prior year. This quarter's results included good contribution from synergies and we continue to have strong additional opportunities.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Jerre. I'll begin with a short update on each of our core industry verticals. And so let's start with Transportation. Transportation produced very strong organic growth of 8% for the quarter, with the growth once again being led by the strong performance of our Auto's team. We remain confident in the growth trends within the used car portion of our Auto business, including continued penetration of the vehicle history report market as well as our new products such as the used car listing and valuation services.","Within the new car portion of our Auto business, we continue to benefit from auto industry trends, including the proliferation of new automotive technologies, global regulatory pressure to curb fuel consumption and emissions, and the increasing use of digital marketing and recall activity.","In Resources, our Energy business experienced a slight increase in our annual contract value for the first time in 10 quarters as we see signs of the upstream market beginning to stabilize. Our Chemicals and OPIS businesses continued to perform well. We are especially pleased with OPIS' strong retail performance, including automakers using our retail fuel data for in-car applications that they are developing to enhance driver experience when shopping for fuel.","Our CERAWeek Conference was in our second quarter this year and reported record revenues. There were many successes from this year's conference that we spoke to in our first quarter call. With that said, I walked away from my first CERAWeek, thoroughly impressed by this marquee event and foresee future revenue synergies with our global Financial Services customers, especially those with strong energy franchises.","CMS total organic revenue was down 1% year-over-year, but we do expect improved performance in the second half of the year.","Finally, Financial Services had a very good quarter with organic growth of 8% and strength across both recurring and nonrecurring revenue. In particular, we had a strong quarter within our pricing, indices, valuation services and processing businesses.","Next I want to provide a quick update on our integration efforts. Since the merger closed in mid-July, we've been executing against our integration plan and continue to make excellent progress. Our initial cost integration efforts are focused on areas where we had some of the most significant overlaps, such as shared services, corporate functions and facilities.","As we discussed on the Q1 call and at our Investor Day, we are confident in our line of sight to achieve a total cost synergy amount greater than our $125 million estimate through 2019. We plan to reinvest these additional savings back into our business around a number of key initiatives in the areas of technology, product development, customers and colleagues. We believe these investments will better position us to achieve our long-term financial objectives on a consistent basis of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-40s with at least 100 basis points of expansion annually.","In terms of revenue synergies, we continue to feel good about achieving our stated objectives. At our Investor Day, we highlighted our early revenue synergy wins. To date, these wins have been across the globe and focused mainly on selling our Resources, Auto, Maritime & Trade and ECR products and insights into our Financial Services customers. Additionally, we have validated the potential to sell our valuation services and enterprise data management technology into our Resources customers with early wins.","Since Investor Day, I have continued to spend time with our customers and teams and can report there is no shortage of new product ideas to help serve our customers' needs in new and exciting ways. We'll carefully consider each of these and build appropriate plans to support any new initiatives.","I hope from our recent Investor Day you were able to sense the enthusiasm we as a management team have for the potential success of IHS Markit. We have an incredible foundation built upon our market-leading assets, colleagues and customer base. We'll use some of the future financial benefits afforded to us by the merger to make measured investments to improve the productivity of our assets and colleagues to better serve our customers and to provide strong and consistent returns to our shareholders.","We look forward to providing you future updates, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that while our Q2 and year-to-date results include IHS and Markit, prior year Q2 and year-to-date results only include legacy IHS. We have included Markit's year-over-year organic revenue growth and FX revenue impact in our revenue growth rates and have included the remainder of Markit revenue as acquisitive revenue growth. Our Q2 absolute and organic revenue growth rates have also been normalized to take account of movement of CERAWeek from Q1 2016 to Q2 2017 and movement of our annual maritime event from Q2 2016 to Q1 2017.","Now for the [Q1] [ph] results. Revenue was $906 million, an increase of 54%. Adjusted EBITDA was $353 million, an increase of 76%, with margin of 38.9% and margin expansion of 480 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.52, an increase of 16%.","Relative to revenue, we were pleased with the quarter as we continue to see strong growth in our Transportation and Financial Services segments and stabilization in our Resources annual contract value or ACV which represents the annualized value of recurring revenue contracts.","Total Q2 reported revenue growth was 54%, organic revenue growth was 3%, acquisitions contributed 51%, and FX was a negative 2% headwind. Recurring organic growth was 3% and nonrecurring organic was 12%.","Looking at segment performance, Transportation normalized growth was 7%, which included 8% organic and negative 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring growth and 6% nonrecurring growth. We continue to expect all-in and recurring Transportation organic growth in the high single-digits but also expect some slowing of our nonrecurring growth due to difficult year-over-year comparisons in our Auto's recall business.","Moving on to Resources, revenue declined 5%, including 4% organic decline and negative 1% FX. The organic revenue decline was comprised of negative 6% recurring, offset somewhat by 5% nonrecurring growth. As expected, our Resources annual ACV increased approximately $2 million. We expect modest ACV growth in the second half of the year and flat ACV for the year. This is due in part to more stable price environment and more favorable capital spending budgets in 2017 than in the past two years.","Our nonrecurring Energy revenue increased $2 million versus prior year, normalized for CERAWeek timing shift. This increase was due to the strength of our CERAWeek event. Our consulting business was flat versus prior year base of $15 million, and software and one-times declined $1 million versus prior year base of $8 million. We expect positive nonrecurring revenue growth in the second half of the year, due primarily to improved consulting performance. We are now forecasting the annual average price of oil to be in the high 40s to low 50s in 2017 and 2018.","CMS declined 4%, which included negative 1% organic and negative 2% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of 1% recurring growth and negative 13% nonrecurring. We expect positive CMS organic revenue growth in the second half of the year due to non-subs growth from Engineering Workbench and the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.","Financial Services organic revenue growth was 8%, with negative 3% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 8% recurring and 11% nonrecurring. We expect Financial Services growth to moderate in the second half of the year but still in line with our long-term performance outlook.","Information had a very strong quarter with organic growth of 8%, led by our index and bond pricing and valuation businesses. Our Processing business delivered another strong quarter with 14% organic revenue growth. This was driven by increased market activity in the loans market and mixed activity in the derivatives market, with the volume in interest rate steady and volume in credit markets lighter. We expect full-year Processing growth in the single-digits. Solutions organic growth was 5%, with both our managed services and software product lines growing in the mid-single-digits.","Turning now to profits and margins, Q2 adjusted EBITDA totaled $353 million, up 76% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.9%, with margin expansion of 480 basis points. Taking account of Markit prior year Q2 margin, normalized margin expansion for combined IHS Markit was approximately 250 basis points.","Margin expansion benefited from our shared service cost synergies, which were allocated across to all segments. Resources segment margin benefited from CERAWeek timing shift and our Financial Services segment margin benefited from strong revenue growth with normalized expansion of approximately 350 basis points. In the quarter, we recorded $30 million of acquisition related expense, including severance, retention and contract termination costs due to merger integration activity.","Our GAAP tax rate was negative 1% and our adjusted tax rate was 22%. Our effective GAAP tax rate benefited from excess tax benefits associated with vesting or exercise of equity awards and also from tax benefits associated with our capital structure.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.52, an increase of $0.07, up 16% versus the prior year. Q2 free cash flow was $142 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $536 million and represented a conversion rate of 42%. Trailing 12-month free cash flow also includes approximately $180 million of restructuring and acquisition related cash costs. Excluding these cash costs, conversion would have been approximately 56%.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter-end debt balance was $4 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x on a bank covenant basis. And our quarter-end cash balance was $162 million. At quarter close, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $890 million, which provided sufficient liquidity to execute our share repurchase commitment. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 416 million shares.","In the quarter, share repurchases were $484 million or 11.6 million shares, at an average share price of $41.71. Year-to-date, share repurchases were approximately $1.1 billion or 27.4 million shares and average price of $39.28. The year-to-date share repurchases included $888 million of our $1.2 billion buyback commitment as well as $188 million from stock option proceeds. We will continue to use a combination of ASRs and open market share repurchases to execute against our repurchase target.","We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance. In terms of highlights, this guidance provides for revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.56 billion. This represents 2% to 4% organic revenue growth, negative FX impact of approximately $50 million and acquisitive revenue of slightly less than $20 million from the CARPROOF and OPIS acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion, which represents margin of 39.4% at the midpoint. And adjusted EPS of $2.02 to $2.08.","We expect other items to track in line with previously provided guidance with the following exceptions. GAAP tax rate of approximately 5% to 10%, excluding any future excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We expect the full-year adjusted tax rate of 20% to 23%. Net interest expense of $145 million to $150 million, higher than original guidance due to higher short-term rates and Q1 capital market debt offering. Stock-based compensation expense of $240 million to $250 million, due to acceleration of certain awards related to ongoing merger integration and higher share price driving higher expense from in-year stock awards. We are still targeting an [indiscernible] share issuance level of 5.5 million shares in 2017 and 4 million shares in 2018. And free cash flow in the mid-50s, which has been negatively impacted by acquisition-related costs.","Just as a reminder to help you with modeling, the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code will be in our second half results this year. The Boiler Code revenue is approximately $10 million and is relatively low margin.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jerre.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Todd. Our many thanks to our colleagues who continue to deliver excellent efforts, resulting in another strong financial quarter. I am feeling very good at where we are as an organization and how far we have come in less than a year of becoming IHS Markit. Moving forward, we will stay very focused on investing for profitable top line growth of our business to provide continued shareholder value creation.","With that, Lance, Todd and I are ready to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","The performance in the Financial Services segment is particularly impressive. I wonder if you could give us some more granularity in terms of the drivers of the revenue growth and the margin performance, and then why are you anticipating some moderation in growth in the second half?","Jerre Stead","Thanks Peter. Lance will be happy to do that.","Lance Uggla","Sure. Thanks Jerre. So I guess it was a very well diversified set of numbers, as Todd and I mentioned, covering pricing, indices, valuation services, a real strong performance. Performance being led by loans and mixed across derivatives proved to be very strong. But as we look forward, year-over-year comparisons, general processing volumes in the marketplace you know is always an uncertainty. We just want you to be thinking about our long-term objectives and guidance for the division. That's what we're confident of delivering. And therefore, we want to make sure that you've got a good conservative outlook for the Group. But a great quarter, we expect continued good performance, and our long term objectives are what we'd like you to focus on.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Lance. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Just wanted to add my, just wanted to mention my congratulations on the [ASV] [ph] growth turning positive. So my question actually is on the Transportation piece. The recurring revenue was stable there at 9%, nonrecurring ticked down a little bit. Todd mentioned the tough recall comps. So we're getting more questions from investors around the moderating new car production. So, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about the growth initiatives that give you confidence in sustaining that upper single digit type growth through the second half of the year.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Bill. Todd will comment on it. Just to give you a good view, as Lance said earlier, lot of new products coming. The balance in total in Transportation, particularly in Automotive, is very strong with new products being introduced, and then remember the balance between used and new cars. So, Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I think the first point, Bill, is the Automotive portfolio has a good level of diversification. So, we sell into OEMs, we also sell into the supply chain, and we sell into dealers as well. So we have some diversification. We have diversification between new cars and used cars, and there tends to be some counter-cyclicality in used cars.","I think focusing on the new car part of the business, you know the growth drivers there continue to be things like the vehicle emissions product, things like digital marketing, and really from a strategic perspective what we've done is we built good long-term relationships with the OEMs so that we have a level of predictable revenue, and then it's about delivering new products and services to those important customers.","And in a tightening market, what happens is that it becomes very important to identify opportunities for market share, and our data has a full view of the entire market. So while OEMs certainly understand what's happening in their business, it's important that they understand what's happening across the entire market landscape, and we have that complete picture and can provide that information. So, even in a flattening market, that conquest becomes even more important and we provide that information that allows the OEMs to effectively compete in their market.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Bill. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","I wanted to ask about the Energy business, and I guess a two-parter. First, given the declines we've seen in oil in the last few months and it sounds like you're calling for a little lower price now, how does that flow through to your business, particularly outside of U.S. shale where investment has come charging back this year? And as part of that, just any color on the ACV improvement, was that just adding OPIS into the mix or was there real improvement in the legacy business as well?","Jerre Stead","Gary, we'll have Todd pick up the last part and then Lance and I will pick up the first part.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, we have excluded OPIS from that ACV number. So we provided a consistent ACV calculation, really going back to the downturn. So we didn't include OPIS. If we had included OPIS in that ACV number, then obviously there would've been a higher level of growth, but we want consistency in how we provided and track that number. And I think I talked about that point a quarter ago.","I think as far as the market itself, certainly it's obviously more stable than it was a couple of years ago. For us, what's important is line of sight into our customers and understanding what's happening with our customer account. So, the market stability, the price, certainly helps, the capital spending being at a more stable level helps, but we've also cycled through accounts multiple times. And so, a lot of the impacts that we saw were customers making significant strategic changes to their exploration and development activities. And I think so long as we don't have another substantial downturn in the market, we feel pretty well-positioned to be able to maintain and grow the sub base.","Jerre Stead","I'd add just a couple of things because I'd like Lance to pick up on it. We actually talked about it at our weekly meeting last week in our executive ops meeting. We've got the beginnings now of the movement of our Energy products into the Finance community, and Lance, give him a few examples because I think, you and I both feel very excited about what that's going to do for us on upstream.","Lance Uggla","Yes, I think it's just, over the last few months we've been doing deep dives into each of our businesses. So, everything that Todd said, I'd just say that there is a fairly diversified set of results coming in from Energy, right from OPIS through Chemicals, great performance, and the upstream getting a stabilizing position.","But some of the new things around Financial Services really kicked off around CERAWeek with Financial Services participants being invited to join in. We have seen good activity globally on the software products, that Vantage Performance Evaluator, really good products that are built, ready, on the shelf, and the introductions of the account management team across financial markets into the big banks and the big energy market participants on the buy side has shown to produce some early wins.","Additionally, we've had our first sale, as we mentioned, on Investor Day, I gave some note of it here in the call this morning, where we've taken data management software. Imagine the complexity of the data across energy markets, with all the different contracts, expirations, different types of products, power, gas, oil. The data management software that IHS Markit has is a leading product in financial markets. We have done the first adaption in sale of that product in the Resources with an early success.","And so, we see the financial markets as an additional diversification across the resources that give us some confidence as we look forward into the rest of the year that our 4% to 6% longer-term growth targets are ones that we can achieve, live by, and deliver to you, and with the investments we make, we hope we can accelerate to a higher end of that.","Jerre Stead","Great. Thanks Lance. Thanks Gary. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Silber","I just wanted to go back to the Resources segment. Lance, I think in your prepared remarks, you said something that you expect that the upstream market is, now you're starting to see signs that it's beginning to stabilize. Can you share with us some examples of what you're seeing?","Jerre Stead","Sure, that's a great question. Lance, pick it up, particularly what you were just giving is examples into the Financial Services community.","Lance Uggla","Yes, so I think one of the best pieces of the merger is the customer base of legacy Markit joining with IHS, including across Transportation, across Economic & Country Risk, and across Resources we're starting to see some of the early wins of the revenue synergies that we put forward. And so, we definitely have confidence in our three-year revenue synergies and we're starting to see some of those come through, and the best of those in Energy will happen in that upstream segment. And so, not specific customer by customer, but as we've said, Vantage and Performance Evaluator sold into financial market participants. That pipeline has grown and we're executing against that.","We also have seen the use of our Energy derivatives data to be used within one of the largest energy companies to price their credit exposures across their customer base, and that's a completely new-found synergy where we see opportunity to take that across the marketplace.","So, I think that coupled with what feels like a base in the 40s, low 50s, in the energy market, we feel that from that base, with the synergies, with the diversification, we feel confidence in our forward-look on the Resources segment.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Lance. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Nick Nikitas","You got Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Just shifting to CMS, rev growth there continue to show some signs of improvement but overall it's been slightly weak, and I realize you've got BPVC in Q3, but can you guys just talk more about second half expectations from an underlying perspective? And then, I guess longer-term from a product portfolio perspective, do you feel like that's in a good spot now or could it be something that going forward you maybe continue to right-size the model a little bit?","Jerre Stead","Good questions. Todd, you pick up on the first part of the question please.","Todd Hyatt","I think when we look at the CMS and the level of performance, we see a low single-digit grower in our legacy specs and standards business, and we do see a path to elevate that with the Engineering Workbench. We also do see in the second half of the year that we'll see improving growth on the non-subs driven by the Engineering Workbench. I think the other \u2013 so, the engineering part of our business and that customer set, very important customer set, and I think a customer set that longer term is certainly an attractive area for us in terms of other opportunities to sell other products.","When we look at TMT, TMT has really been transformed and we went from a one-off report selling business to building larger subscription-based product offerings. I mean that certainly had a drag from a non-subs in the revenue impact, but Lance and I did a deep dive with the TMT guys a week ago and I think there is some good assets and good market position in that area, and we do think that that scenario that we can elevate the growth. So, I'll let you give your thoughts on it.","Jerre Stead","Before he does, quick comment on ECR though too, Todd, if you would, and then Lance?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I mean ECR has been not growing at the level that we would like it to grow at, but we actually see with ECR and Financial Services some really substantial opportunities for cross-sell between those two groups. And Adam Kansler, who runs the Financial Service part of the business, is also managing ECR because of our view of the opportunity that we have between those products. So longer-term, we feel we have a good position in macroeconomic risk and forecasting and we can build on that position.","Jerre Stead","Great. Thanks Todd. Lance, pick up.","Lance Uggla","I would just say that it's nice that we get a CMS call first off, so thank you for that, because we get a lot of focus across the firm on our other divisions, and so it's good that we get to give a shout-out to the team. But I have to say when, and it really is just the deep dives around CMS are just starting for me personally, but the first ones, as Todd referenced, a few weeks back we dove in with the TMT guys in London. And I have to say that the market intelligence piece of that business, which competes against the likes of Gartners and others, this is a good segment to be in, and the team really has 12 industry areas they are covering, six B2B, six consumer based businesses, all areas of good economic activity in that technology sector.","So, under Ian Weightman's leadership, who runs that business, he's got two great individuals in Tom and Francis that lead the B2B and consumer segments, I think they've got a reasonable upside to predict in the second half in terms of making that business a bit brighter.","On the product design side, I have to say, the Workbench 2.0 release to us is a very important piece of that release. This is a Workbench that's consolidating global specs and standards, it's competitively strong, and they are already working on Workbench 3.0.","So, I think the combination of that, we look forward, we think a low single-digit expectation for now is a good one for you to put into your models, and we'll update you as we develop from there. But it is an important piece of our portfolio and glad you asked a question about it.","Jerre Stead","Last quick comment on that, if you look as a percentage of improvement on the margins, last year was the highest total improvement, it's the lowest margins, but that's upside in 2017 and 2018 too. Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. Lance, could you make a quick comment on MiFID II as you look at the Financial Services segment, what are headwinds, what are tailwinds, is this a needle-mover?","Lance Uggla","I didn't want to get anybody adding extra stuff in their model on MiFID II. But I have to say, I don't know if anybody has read the recent McKinsey report, they've put out a great report on MiFID II, and I actually think if you really look at it, independent research providers are winners under MiFID II. And we have strong research capability. I don't know if I want to say over 1,000 researchers in our firm, I'm sure it's many, it's actually, I don't have the number but I'm sure it's many more than that. We can come back to you on that. But we have a large number of people that are writing independent research across Aerospace & Defense, Maritime & Trade, Resources, upstream, Chemicals, OPIS. We have people writing research on over 200 countries in Economics & Country Risk. And the TMT group leading research in 12 industry segments.","So, I think it is an important area for us to get well organized around in terms of how are we going to sell IHS Markit research into the tens of thousands of buy side that are going to be adjusting their models going into MiFID II. So I think we are well-positioned. We haven't put that into our revenue synergies in our original thought. We've always thought financial markets would be a good place for research. MiFID II is the tailwind for our researchers.","Jerre Stead","Great answer. Thank you, Andrew. Good question. Next.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","I just wanted to follow up on the MiFID I as well. So, that great McKinsey report also talked about the decline in the spend on research, and obviously that means a lot of headcount pressures, at least on our side of the world. And so, I was just hoping, how you think your exposure to the headcount there potentially is an impact? And then beyond just research from the legacy Markit businesses, do you see any puts and takes there in terms of how MiFID could help or hurt?","Lance Uggla","Yes, definitely. Well, we do have broker voting, commission management, several research tools, transaction cost analysis. So we are well-positioned form a financial market perspective as one of the participants playing into the new MiFID regulations.","But going back to research, I actually think \u2013 see, our research base today across IHS Markit has been mainly subscriptions taking up from corporates and governments and more traditional corporate participants, and the amount of revenue that we have associated to financial markets from the research products of legacy IHS is negligible. So, to me it's all upside for us. But we have to get the model right of how we are going to sell into that marketplace.","You have to remember, we have subject matter experts and industry experts that financial market participants want access to. So coupling that with subscription-based research and finding a way to sharing that commission sharing arrangements or pure subscriptions is going to be an important model adjustment for us and we're going to get it right. It's work in progress but we do see it as the tailwind, as Andrew asked previously.","Jerre Stead","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Is there any way to quantify how much new products, either by segment or just across the enterprise, contribute to organic revenue growth in any given year?","Jerre Stead","So that's a great question, thanks. I'll start and both Lance and Todd will pick up on it. That's a question that's come up. We will end up making sure as we go into 2018 we give you the way we are measuring that, and then we'll measure and report on it on a quarterly basis. I would say, that's why I'm keen for Lance to make comment, is he's doing the deep dives, we are [indiscernible] in a sea of opportunity for new products. The big question for us is to set the priorities that will give us the best return. Lance?","Lance Uggla","I think at the Investor Day that question came up and it is, we've got existing products that are adding new features and new bells and whistles, and adjusting to market opportunities. So we need to measure that. We also have pure outright new product development. We need to measure that. That's easier. We do small bolt-on acquisitions, and those together create new opportunities for product.","What we haven't done really well, and we think it would be a competitive advantage for us to do so, is to actually do what Jerre said, describe it and report it, and that's something that we hope in our future we can give you better transparency as to our new product development and what percent of our revenues comes in each three to five-year period from new products.","Jerre Stead","Quick, Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I mean we don't separately report it, but I do think as we look ahead and we look at the strategy, I mean the foundation of the strategy is really taking existing data sets that we have and information assets and building new solutions for customers with that core asset base. A number of examples where we've had good success across both companies, when we talk about the used car listing valuation in CARFAX or we talk about the VPaC, lot of the digital marketing in Autos, Vantage Performance Evaluator in Financial Services. I think the Financial Services, a lot of the foundation of that has been on building the bond pricing. You have bond pricing valuation services built internally. So I think both companies have had a good level of success, but it's a very good point, this notion of tracking and reporting the vitality and that I think is something we've talked about and certainly will make it happen.","Jerre Stead","Thank you. Next.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Appreciate you taking the question, lots of ebb and flow here this morning. Lance, I want to dig in a little bit on Financial Services further. That is, can you talk a little bit about either customer churn trends or revenue churn trends, depending on how you measure those internally and how they have tracked? I know churn may have picked up a little bit last year, it seems like you are lapping some of that. So, maybe an update there would be helpful.","Lance Uggla","I don't really see our customers, it's about adding new customers in financial markets, and we have a well-developed account management program that retains and manages our largest relationships globally. So that's very focused on retention and growing the book of business. But we also have a lot of new product, new account development where we go after a large number of accounts that only buy one product from us, whereas on average we might get five to seven, and with our biggest accounts they could be buying 20-plus products from us.","So, a lot of growth in some of the single-touch customers that we have globally, and then there's the complete new customer that we go after, you know chasing down new leads. So, our goal every year is to expand our customer base, and I don't think across either firm, the entire customer base actually declines. It's always growing, it's alive, we're trying to retain business and build new business. So, I feel pretty good about that.","I think one of the measurements that we do is we look at how robust our pipeline is, does it support our longer-term objectives and growth assumptions, and that pipeline has been stable and it's very supportive of how we look at our long-term objectives for Financial Services and supports the numbers that we want you to model to.","Jerre Stead","Thank you. Good question. Next.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Nick","This is Nick on for Anj. Just a question on Resources margins. Excluding the high margin CERAWeek impact this quarter, are you still seeing margin expansion in the Resources business, and any updated thoughts on the margin expansion at that segment as Resources ACV returns to growth?","Jerre Stead","I'll start, Todd will pick up. If you look at the addendums that we gave out, you'll see that it was a great quarter, actually the highest, for Resources at I think 44.9%. The most exciting thing to me and Lance and Todd is that three of our biggest businesses all were in the 40s, which is a great step forward, lots to do. As we said, CMS as a percent of improvement continues to be good. Todd, pick up though because the impact of CERAWeek is minor compared to the total business.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I mean we called out CERAWeek last quarter because it had an impact on margin in the other direction. So you need to look at Q1 and Q2 together for Resources to get a good view of [margins] [ph]. All the segments are getting some lift from cost reductions in corporate shared services facilities that are being allocated across all the segments.","What I would say about Resources is, we've done or the team has done a good job of maintaining margin in a challenged environment, and certainly as revenue turns, Resources has a substantial level of operating leverage and there will be opportunity to drive much of any incremental revenue growth through to the margin line.","So, I think we feel good about the margin that we've been able to maintain and actually grow over the last couple of years, and as we see improvement in the end market, we'll have the ability to further expand the margin in Resources.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Todd. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS Securities. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Just wanted to come back to the Financials segment, and I think this is for Todd or for Lance, the one thing that stood out to me was really the strength in the Information part, and I assume part of that was recurring variable. So maybe you can flesh this out a little bit. I assume AUM and index, maybe some bond pricing positions, et cetera, the question I'm really asking is, like that should be sustainable at these levels, so why would there be a falloff again considering that that business is going to build on itself going forward?","Jerre Stead","Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Well, I don't think \u2013 8% as far as Information on a long-term sustainable basis is not something that Lance and company talked about historically. I mean we've always looked at Information as a very stable 4% to 6%, 5% to 7% type grower.","A lot of good things happened in the quarter. To your point, there was a bit of a lift in some of the volume based revenues. I think there's always a point or so just when we look at things like timing that can move around. So, a lot of good things fell into place to get us to 8%, but we don't expect long-term, 8% is not what we've talked about, I think that's 5% to 7% that Markit talked about historically as a reasonable range to put around Information.","Lance Uggla","I think that's right, Alex. If you go back in time, we now have a total of seven periods where we talked about 5% to 7% over time, and if I look at twice being around 4% to 5%, twice being in 5% to 7%, and now this is the third time we've been above 7%. And I think the way we want to look at it is, our business is well-organized, well diversified, has a good customer set, and a strong set of steady opportunities to deliver 5% to 7%. But we don't want to be shy and upset at 4% and we don't want to brag at 8%. And so, that's kind of in the callout on that. So once again, we are supportive long-term of our Information assets in that 5% to 7% range and we're fortunate this quarter to be able to give you a number above that.","Jerre Stead","Well said, Lance. Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Jerre, CERAWeek had a really good mood over there when I was over there. There was a lot of talk about taking costs out of the base for a lot of the clients. It was also time when oil prices were around $54 a share. I know you guys have done this analysis in just referencing a comment that Todd made about companies changing their strategic plans and capital investments. At this point in time with the changes that your customers have made, what type or what level of oil pricing do they need to think about on a sustainable basis for them to start retracting on some of their capital spending plans or making changes strategically, because that's clearly something that we have to look at with the volatility in oil prices right now?","Jerre Stead","Good question. I'll start, Todd will pick up on it for sure, but where we are today and where our experts are is that we would expect somewhere between $48 to $50 a barrel in 2018 at the Brent level, and that will \u2013 it shifted a lot. You're right, at CERAWeek, a lot of optimism, but the cost and productivity is significantly improves, especially in North America, continues to be.","And so, I think our analysis would say, capital spending in North America is solid and will continue to be. We expect actually do see in 2018, 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day more U.S. growth in oil output. So that feels good between December 2016 and December 2018. And I think in general, we're seeing the same thing across the world as productivity becomes a massive change from where they were before. Todd?","Todd Hyatt","I think I said on the call high 40s to low 50s for 2017 and 2018. Within that, our experts would say that there can be some variability. So, we can see prices go into the low 40s, we can see prices potentially move up to the high 50s within that range. I think that range, operating in that range provides a level of confidence that we'll be able to drive stability and increasing sub base as we look ahead over the next couple of years.","Jerre Stead","The other thing I'd add to that, and you heard Lance talk about it a few minutes ago, if you think about our total Resources business, certainly OPIS downstream and our Chemicals business is very strong and continues to be, and we expect that for the foreseeable future. The big upside we have today that the merger will now prove to be a great help for us is in the upstream, as you heard Lance talk about the new products coming across both ways.","So, if you think about it into the future, our impact, if you remember in 2008 and 2009 where historic IHS was actually 50%-plus of oil and gas, today if you look at upstream, because we really weren't in downstream, then if you look at upstream, all-in it's a little under 20% with big upside. And Lance, you might want to just give one or two more examples.","Lance Uggla","On yesterday's executive call that you lead, Jerre, Shane who runs our Account Management out in Asia, when we were talking about synergies, and one of the things he said that always resonates now to me when I'm with financial market participants is there is, it's a long way to second place in terms of energy advisory and leadership.","We have the thought leaders in the industry. Financial market participants want to hear them. MiFID II plays well into them. And having the likes of Carlos Pascual, Atul Arya, Dan Yergin, Jim on the oil strategy side, like we really have industry thought leadership. And in this challenged marketplace, whether you're in the Middle East, you're in China, you're in the Permian, thought leadership and expertise is highly valued, and I think that's going to play well into our strategy. MiFID II is a bit of a tailwind, getting organized for that, we're just getting started. So, I do think that that gives that upstream a better solid base to build from, and although it may be a bit volatile, the underlying oil price, we've got the thought leadership around that to take our market share.","Jerre Stead","Just while we were having this meeting, I got a photo from Shane meeting with one of the largest CEO in China, and they are talking about not only our economic forecasting but some of the new financial product offering. I'd show you the photo if I could, but it's a good one and it's a great example of what Lance just talked about. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open.","David Chu","So I believe you started to raise pricing for the Information business in Financial Services. Can you just let us know how much of a contributor that was to growth in the second quarter and expectations for the year?","Todd Hyatt","I think we've always said that that's sub 1% impact, because a lot of contracts, three-year contracts, not every product is open for price. So if you're modeling sub 1%, I think that's the right number.","Jerre Stead","Great, thanks. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] calling in for Hamzah. Can you give us a sense of where you are in the process of moving customers to being serviced by inside sales versus field sales reps?","Jerre Stead","A great question. Lance, you pick it up and I'll finish with it because that's a good broad --.","Lance Uggla","Yes, a nice one. Again, I think one of the great things in the merger was the better developed or deeper developed inside sales expertise that has been set up in legacy IHS, from Englewood to Bracknell to Penang, and other centers, we really have developed both a strategy, a leadership and a best cost location for inside sales. It's an area that we need to invest in and grow, and as we look forward, we see inside sales especially with the investment in technology to allow us to both mine digital information for lead generation but then also using our salesforce.com global platform that we're rolling out to manage those leads through the lifecycle and expect that our inside sales team will be able to get to a farther reach and a more efficient way to expand our customer base. So, it's not a huge bit now, but IHS had set up a well-organized process \u2013 or team, sorry \u2013 and we're going to build on that.","Jerre Stead","Last quick comment on that, Lance just said about salesforce.com, I met with the sales op team leading that last week. That upside when we exit 2017, into 2018, will do exactly what Lance said and enable us to do things we've never done before. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Mike Greene] [ph] on for Joe. I was wondering if you could just go into maybe a little bit more detail on the good momentum in the fixed income indexing business, inflows globally to the fixed income ETFs and the progress on ALBI?","Lance Uggla","Okay, ALBI. For those of you that don't know the ALBI is the HSBC indices across Asia and the Middle East that we acquired. So I'll just pick that one off. Delivered what we \u2013 if we did say anything about numbers and what we're going to deliver, I can't remember, but I can tell you internally what we said we were going to do, we've done that and exceeded it. It's small, it's not material in our overall numbers, but the team did an excellent job of moving that customer base from HSBC into IHS Markit. So, a great job.","I think indices, I have to say, we're very fortunate as a company to have a world-class index franchise, and the fixed income franchises are really limited to the internal products of the banks. So there are some smaller ones that were the \u2013 both Maryland City had franchises, both now have been sold to LSE and to ICE. The bigger franchise was with Barclays that we competed head on, and that went to Bloomberg and ourselves.","And so, we have the as an independent provider second-largest franchise in the world, 140 billion of ETFs of AUM against our indices. It's a double-digit grower. We do the underlying pricing, so there's great synergies, and I think we're very, very well situated.","And I'll just shift it because nobody is asking questions about Yaacov and Digital. So I'd like to give that team a bit of a shout-out here, and it ties into the index franchise. So, one of the things that we've been able to do, and you really have to think about appointing a Chief Data Scientist, it's not just marketing, this is about us building relationships and expanding the use of our data and the creation of new products. It's happening across the firm but in indices specifically, the team has been able to really crack advanced analytics and index production where we're going to move fixed income indices to the next phase as we look forward, and Yaacov and his team is proving that having that team focused proof of concepts rolling back into real production is going to be a win across all our industry sectors. So, I know we didn't get a question but we'd like to make sure Yaacov is out front and center.","Jerre Stead","Last question. Thanks Lance.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Sort of a broad strategic question for you, long-term how are you thinking about the impact of autonomous driving and growth in shared transportation on the Transportation business?","Jerre Stead","It's a great question. Lance, you're deep into that.","Lance Uggla","Yes, as a leading firm in the Transportation segment, clearly autonomous vehicles are an important part of the R&D and therefore going to impact vehicle numbers as we look forward into 2020 and beyond. So, we've got a great team, we did produce, we're about to complete a piece of research that's quite important that was led across our Energy and our Automotive teams called Reinventing the Wheel, and that's a substantive effort of market participants led by IHS Markit. So we'll make sure we get you a copy of that. But it's an important part of the evolving transportation business and we have to be at the leading edge of that.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, and over to you, Eric.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Eric Boyer","Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other items. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS Markit believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited.","Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit\u2019s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website.","After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, Chairman and CEO; Lance Uggla, President and COO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Eric. And thanks to all of you for joining IHS Markit Q3 Earnings call. First, we want to express that our thoughts are with the people and communities impacted by the recent natural disasters. I want to personally thank our impacted colleagues in continuing to serve our customers despite facing significant personal hardships of their own. We look forward to doing what we can to continue to help these communities recover.","Today, we\u2019ll review our solid Q3 results, provide you with an update on our integration work, and discuss our acquisitions of autoMastermind and Macroeconomic Advisers. Let\u2019s move to the high level financial results in Q3, then Lance will provide the industry highlights, integration update and details on our acquisitions.","Revenue was $905 million, up 5% year-over-year on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $351 million and margins of 38.8%, representing an expansion of 170 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.57, up 27% over the prior year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Jerre. First, I\u2019d like to thank the IHS Markit team for continuing to build on our merger commitments and delivering a solid set of results across the firm.","Let\u2019s get started with the short update for each of our key verticals, beginning with transportation.","Transportation produced very strong organic growth of 13% for the quarter with the growth once again being led by the strong performance of our Auto\u2019s team. We remain confident in the growth trends within the used car portion of our Auto business including continued penetration of the vehicle history report market, new products such as the used car listing and valuation services and extending our reach into the banking and insurance world.","Within the new car portion of our Auto business, we continued to benefit from strong industry trends including the increasing use of digital marketing. The proliferation of new automotive technologies, global regulatory pressure to curb fuel consumption and emissions, and strong recall activity. What has impressed me the most is the strong diversity of our overall Auto growth covering all areas of our portfolio.","Now in Resources, our energy business reported improved revenue trends and flat annual contract value as the upstream market continues to stabilize while our mid and downstream businesses including chemicals and OPIS continued to have solid performance. As I said last quarter, we\u2019ve seen the formation of a new baseline to grow from and we\u2019ve organized the team well for 2018.","CMS total organic revenue was up 7% year-over-year, benefitting from the biennial Boiler Pressure Vessel Code or BPVC and 1% excluding BPVC. This division has been very focused on a return to organic growth, and we expect this positive trend to continue into Q4. Finally, Financial Services had a very good and well diversified quarter with organic revenue of 5% and strength across both recurring and non-recurring revenues. In particular, we had a strong quarter within our pricing, indices, valuation services and managed loan services businesses, to name a few of the areas.","Next, I want to provide an update on our integration efforts. Since the merger closed in mid-July 2016, we have been executing against our integration plan and continue to make excellent progress against our commitments. We continue to work towards our 4% to 6% annual organic revenue growth goal and as discussed, see continued strong performance within Transportation and Financial Services as well as improvements within Resources and CMS. We have taken particular pride in doing exactly what we said we\u2019d do. We\u2019ll exceed the $125 million in cost synergies and we remain committed to achieving a mid-40s adjusted EBITDA margin over time, delivering a minimum of 100 basis points per year and double-digit earnings growth over the longer term.","In terms of revenue synergies, we are making great progress with the buildup of our synergies and have increasing confidence in our target of $100 million of run rate, exiting 2019. We\u2019re also committed to strong capital management and are on track to deliver on our 2017 and 2018 buyback commitments.","And finally, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll acquire within our core areas of competence, and that brings me to the acquisitions of Macroeconomic Advisers and automotiveMastermind. Earlier this month, we acquired Macroeconomic Advisers, which is a relatively small, but will enhance our U.S. macro and regional economic forecasting capabilities. And then this morning, we announced the acquisition of automotiveMastermind, which is a very high growth market leader in providing automotive dealers in the U.S. with predictive analytics and marketing automation technology to help drive new vehicle purchases.","Underpinning Mastermind\u2019s offerings is an analytics engine that predicts automotive buying behavior and a marketing platform that automates the creation of one-to-one messaging and targeted offers, leading to proven higher sales and more consistent customer retention. This is an excellent business, which has been on a very substantive growth path that adds to and strengthens our overall automotive franchise. We\u2019re extremely excited to welcome the Mastermind team to IHS Markit.","Now, first, Mastermind complements the strong assets we\u2019ve already built in the automotive marketing where we\u2019re using a unique combination of data analytics and digital capabilities, we help OEMs target specific households to achieve better ROI on their marketing spend. Mastermind will help us extend this marketing franchise within new car dealers, which is a large and fragmented market of over 17,500 domestic dealers. This market is highly strategic for us as a large portion of the $20 billion advertising spend and the $50 billion incentive spend for new vehicles is actioned right on the dealer floor. This will also complement CARFAX as we now have the ability to sell multiple offerings into franchise dealers. ","Second, we expect enhanced new product development, leveraging our combined data, domain expertise, and analytic capabilities, enhancing both our existing OEM and dealer offerings. Third, over time, we believe Mastermind will be able to leverage our global footprint and we will be able to expand geographically. And finally, we believe the timing of this acquisition positions us well to benefit from our customers\u2019 growing need for better market intelligence as competition increases for market share.","I\u2019d like to say that this acquisition is initially about entry into an exciting new car dealer market for us and adding high growth capabilities to our Auto\u2019s portfolio. We have confidence that the higher growth rates in Mastermind\u2019s core market will continue in the years to come and are excited about the revenue synergies we can build together.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that while our Q3 and year-to-date results include IHS and Markit, prior year Q3 and year-to-date includes legacy Markit for the full reporting period and legacy Markit from July 12th through August 31st. We\u2019ve included Markit\u2019s year-over-year organic revenue growth and FX revenue impacts in our revenue growth rates and have included the remainder of Markit revenue as acquisitive revenue growth.","Now for the Q3 results.","Revenue was $905 million, an increase of 25%. Adjusted EBITDA was $351 million, an increase of 30% with margin of 38.8% and margin expansion of 170 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of 27%. Relative to revenue, we were pleased with the quarter as we continue to see very strong growth in our automotive business and Transportation segment, solid growth in our Financial Services segment, stabilization in our Resources annual contract value or ACV and improved growth in CMS. Total Q3 reported revenue growth was 25%; organic revenue growth was 5%, including BPVC and 4% excluding BPVC. Acquisitive growth contributed 20% for Markit revenue for the non-sub period and FX was a minimal impact in the quarter. Recurring organic growth was 3% and non-recurring organic was 21%, including BPVC and 14% excluding BPVC.","Looking at segment performance. Transportation growth was 13%, which included 13% organic and flat FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 11% recurring growth and 19% non-recurring growth. We continue to see very strong growth across our entire Auto\u2019s portfolio. This quarter we benefited from recall related offerings which were delivered in Q3 instead of Q4. We expect recurring revenue to remain strong in Q4, but non-recurring growth will be challenged due to a difficult year-over-year comparison and pull forward revenue from Q3.","Moving to Resources. Revenue declined 4%, including 4% organic decline and flat FX. The organic revenue decline was comprised of negative 4% recurring offset somewhat by 1% non-recurring growth. Our resources annual ACV was flat for Q3, our year-to-date resources ACV is negative $10 million, and we expect modest ACV growth in the Q4. Our non-recurring energy consulting and software revenue was $16 [ph] million and was up slightly versus prior year. We expect positive non-recurring revenue growth in Q4 as well. We are now forecasting the annual average price of oil to be in the high 40s to low 50s in 2017 and 2018.","CMS growth was 6% and included 7% organic and minus 1% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of 1% recurring growth and 48% non-recurring growth. Excluding BPVC, CMS organic growth was 1% and non-recurring organic was minus 4%. Financial Services revenue growth was 4% including organic revenue growth of 5% and minus 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring and 28% non-recurring.","Information had a solid quarter with organic growth of 5%, led by our index and fixed income pricing and valuation businesses. As expected, our processing business moderated in the quarter with a 3% organic decline. Solutions\u2019 organic growth was 10% due primarily to strong growth in our managed service loan business and our regulatory compliance products.","Turning now to profits and margins.","Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $351 million, up 30% versus the year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.8% with margin expansion of 170 basis points. Taking account of Markit prior year Q3 margin, normalized margin expansion for combined IHS Markit was approximately 40 basis points.","Margin expansion moderated somewhat from prior quarter due in part to impact of lower margin BPVC revenue and FX including mark-to-market losses and weakening U.S. dollar, which increased revenue but also increased expense. CMS margin was negatively impacted from lower margin BPVC revenue and transportation margin was positively impacted by strong revenue growth.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.57, an increase of $0.12, up 27% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS benefited from lower adjusted taxes offset somewhat by higher interest expense and share dilution. Our adjusted tax rate was 13% and our GAAP tax rate was minus 32%. Both rates benefited from tax benefits associated with the capital structure and the release of a valuation allowance. The GAAP tax rate also benefited from merger related expenses and excess tax benefit associated with vesting or exercise of equity awards and share price increased from date of grant.","We now expect a full year adjusted tax rate of 20% to 21%. We expect a full year GAAP tax rate of approximately negative 5%, excluding any future excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Q3 free cash flow was $206 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $642 million and represented a conversion rate of 47%. Trailing 12-month free cash flow includes approximately $150 million of restructuring and acquisition-related cash costs. Excluding these cash costs, conversion would have been approximately 58%. We expect to return to a mid-60s conversion rate for 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our quarter-end debt balance was $4 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times on a bank covenant basis. And our quarter-end cash balance was $154 million. In the quarter, we completed a $300 million debt offering add-on to our existing 2025 notes with an effective interest rate of 3.88%. At quarter close, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 414.2 million shares.","In the quarter, share repurchases were $324 million or 5.8 million shares, an average share price of $45.25 excluding $60 million for shares that will be delivered at the completion of our $300 million ASR. Year-to-date, share repurchases were approximately $1.4 billion or 33.2 million shares, an average price of $40.33, excluding the $60 million for shares that will be delivered at the completion of the ASR. The year-to-date share repurchases included $1.1 billion of our $1.2 billion 2017 buyback commitment as well as $300 million from stock option proceeds.","In terms of guidance. On a full year basis, we expect revenue at the upper end of our current range of $3.49 billion to $3.56 billion with organic revenue growth of 3% to 4% and negative FX impact of approximately $30 million versus the $50 million negative FX impact provided in our original guidance. Adjusted EBITDA in the low to midpoint of our guidance range of $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA has been impacted by higher expenses from several non-recurring expense items, including negative mark-to-market FX expense of $6 million and accelerated IT-related spend from the continued migration to the cloud. Adjusted EPS in the midpoint of our guidance range of $2.02 to $2.08. Adjusted EPS includes the positive benefit of lower adjusted tax rate offset somewhat by higher interest expense from higher short-term floating interest rates and from our 2017 debt offerings and also from higher share dilution. Specifically, we now expect the full year adjusted tax rate of 20% to 21% and full year interest expense of approximately $150 million.","In terms of acquisitions. In the past week, we closed Macroeconomic Advisers for $12 million and we also closed automotiveMastermind. Relative to Mastermind, our automotive business has continued to deliver very high growth and we enjoy market-leading positions in the used car information services market and in the new car market, primarily with OEMs and suppliers.","Mastermind provides us an anchor position in new car dealer sales and marketing analytics and support. This is a large addressable market that is complementary and synergistic with our existing automotive franchise. We acquired approximately 78% of Mastermind for a purchase price of approximately $392 million with potential to increase upto $435 million, based on business performance through January 2018. The remaining 22% of the business is owned by the Company\u2019s founders and employees. We will acquire this interest over the next five years, based on valuation tied to underlying adjusted EBITDA performance. This earnout structure provides strong alignment between Mastermind management and IHS Markit.","The Mastermind founders have focused on investing and growing the business. Mastermind is a high growth business, which is expected to more than double revenue in 2017 and finish with full year revenue of approximately $50 million. We expect significant revenue growth into the future and are targeting 2018 revenue of approximately $80 million and 2019 revenue of approximately $125 million. As the business continues to scale, we expect EBITDA margin in the single digits in 2018 and margin to significantly ramp to approximately 25% in 2019 with continued expansion from there.","Looking ahead, we plan to provide 2018 guidance in November, but want to provide some context today. As Lance said, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of 100 basis points of margin expansion per year. We do however expect several non-operational items to negatively impact our adjusted EPS growth for 2018. First, our $1 billion share buyback commitment for 2018 will be less frontend loaded to 2017 due in part to the Mastermind acquisition. Second, we are planning to continue to term out our debt structure to lock in long-term interest rates at very attractive levels, but this will result in higher interest expense. Third, we have been very efficient with our tax rate in 2017 and do expect a modest increase in our adjusted tax rate in 2018, but also expect to remain in our long-term range of low to mid-20s. And finally, depreciation expense will increase over time and on a long-term basis will track in line with our annual capital spending levels. We look forward to providing more detail on our 2018 expectations on our November guidance call.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Todd. And my many thanks to our colleagues who continued to deliver excellent results with another strong financial quarter. Although, this is my last earnings call as Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit, Lance has asked me to return for the Q4 call to report the results of my last quarter as a public company CEO. So, I will say good bye to everyone in January.","As I look back at how far we\u2019ve come since we announced the merger over a year and half ago, I am filled with a great sense of pride and gratitude in having been able to lead such great people who have done such great things. We have truly built an information powerhouse, which is very well positioned for success for many years to come.","I\u2019ll be leaving IHS Markit in the great hands of Lance, who is a proven leader who shares the same passion for delighting our customer providing exciting opportunities for our colleagues and delivering strong return for our shareholders.","And with that, we\u2019re ready to open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. So, the guidance would suggest, I think I\u2019m computing this correctly, fairly meaningful deceleration in the adjusted EPS growth in the fourth quarter. So, could you call out any of the specific issues that might be driving that?","Jerre Stead","Yes. You bet, Peter. Go ahead, Todd. We tried to do that with what Todd just talked about; let\u2019s expand on it.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. Peter, we talked about from a non-operational perspective, certainly FX and mark-to-market has been an impact really throughout the year. And then that sits in the other expense line item. So, if you look at other expense, you\u2019ll see a negative there that\u2019s a big chuck of it. We have frontloaded some of the IT investment as we\u2019ve started some forward investing in the period. And the other thing that I talked about was very strong revenue growth, very strong non-recurring revenue in automotive, and we see that in Q4, a bit more challenged comp. So, I think those are probably the big things. But, in general, I think still delivering at what we said we would do and pretty solid results for the year is what we\u2019re forecasting.","Jerre Stead","And I\u2019d just add a bit. When you look at the supplement that we\u2019ve provided, Peter, the Q3 2017 earnings, really a remarkable performance; we\u2019ve got our big three businesses performing at 44%, 43%, and 45%. As Todd said, CMS was pulled down with BPVC; I\u2019ve never learned to do that, and Lance did. So, there is a good reason why he is going to be CEO very quick, and you\u2019ve got another year to get ready for it, Lance. So, if you think about where we\u2019re at, you heard both, Lance and Todd, recommit to the mid-40s. We\u2019re not that far away from it. And you can do the math, but I feel really good about the operational efforts that are underway. As Todd said, it\u2019s a non-operational and should be one-time issues, as we think about it going forward. And you should be planning, as they\u2019ve just committed. They being Todd and Lance recommitted to what we said we\u2019d deliver for years to come. Thanks Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the automotiveMastermind acquisition. I wanted to ask about what gives you the confidence in the high growth rate that you\u2019re looking for in the business. And maybe as part of that you could talk about the overlap on the dealer base with CARFAX and maybe that\u2019s part of it.","Jerre Stead","I\u2019ll start, Bill, and have Lance pick up on it. I\u2019ve, over the years, done probably 200 acquisitions. I always make sure that we\u2019ve got a very, very strong probability of delivering. This one, I must say we probably worked harder than any we\u2019ve worked on for a long time to have a great deal of confidence of what Lance is going to tell you about in just a minute. I feel really good about this one. This one will be my last one, on my watch, if you -- so to speak. And I feel what it\u2019s done for us and what it will do is really outstanding. The last quick comment and then turn it over to Lance. Remember what Todd just told you, like the 25% EBITDA in 2019; that does not include the synergies that we\u2019re going to pick up with the other parts of the business. So that\u2019s a very strong one. Lance?","Lance Uggla","Sure, thanks. Hi, Bill. So, I guess the first thing is when I first met Marco and Johannes, the co-CEOs of Mastermind, I have to say, super strong entrepreneurs, started their life moving from Germany to New York City doing car sales for Mercedes, really understand the business well. These are two very, very sharp individuals and great asset to our team. They really impressed all the team here and we immediately saw their depth and knowledge of the business, and the model that they\u2019ve developed was very complementary to us. That\u2019s the first point. And their accolades in terms of awards, I think they came number 7 out of 5,000 in the Inc awards, and these -- many other accolades which you can check out online, but top individuals with the top team.","The second thing I\u2019d like to say is the digitization of the entire automotive marketplace. This is a growth area that we\u2019ve been calling out from with respect to our IHS Markit Automotive franchise. We\u2019ve seen it through the CARFAX franchise, and the dealer floor is a critical third component of that that we will be expanding and filling out with the Mastermind acquisition.","The third thing I\u2019d say is that regardless of SAARs, the spend of $20 billion advertising, $50 billion incentives, these are driven regionally, locally right down to the individual franchise. And the growth that we\u2019ve seen as well as what we see from the Mastermind side provide both synergies as well fuels the additional growth in Mastermind.","So, you should look at IHS Markit going deeper in an automotive franchise that we are already at the winning position \u2013 we\u2019re with the leading position. And this is complementary and gives us strong growth as we look forward and a full suite that\u2019s penetrated to the best of the Markit\u2019s opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Silber","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Henry Chien. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit upon your thinking for acquisitions for the next year, just sounds like automotive is an attractive space, especially with the digital trends that you mentioned. But just more broadly, how you\u2019re thinking about acquisitions, whether you\u2019re looking for more, additional tuck-ins or any verticals that you are particularly interested in? Thanks.","Jerre Stead","Yes. No, I\u2019ll just start and have Lance pick it up, because he\u2019ll be telling what\u2019s going on next year. We said at the time of the merger announcement and when we closed, and I believe we said it every quarter that any acquisitions we do would complement the existing business lines and that we would focus on our capital return to share owners that continues the commitment that was just maid of at least $1 billion in 2018 of share buyback. So, Lance?","Lance Uggla","Yes. Well, I think you kind of said it, Jerre. When we said out at Investor Day, it was all about establishing a baseline of creditability, doing what we say we\u2019re going to do and sticking to the program. And I really think that the leadership team that Jerre and I have put together is fully committed to that. So, from an acquisition perspective, we said some bolt-ons, people ask us what would be the size of that, we said sub-500, and we would be committing to our margin expansion; we\u2019d been committing to our growth profile; we\u2019d be investing additional dollars from synergies into a go-forward plan, and acquisitions would be minimal. And so, you shouldn\u2019t expect a slew of acquisitions in anyway, but small tuck-ins that make sense that fit into what we said we\u2019re going to do, you may see, but they\u2019ll always be deepening our franchise. Don\u2019t expect the diversification move from us but expect us to own the markets we\u2019re in and to continue to be the leading player.","Jerre Stead","And I\u2019d just add one thing to that which as last just completed several months with our team of 67, what we call deep dives into our different businesses. And I think we come out of their feeling that we\u2019ve got a better handle on internal opportunities than probably we\u2019ve ever had as we\u2019ve made the merger. So, I think our ability to provide organic growth that we\u2019ve committed to is strong, clearly with the acquisition we just made, it will enhance that. So, I think the need for acquisitions is not to gain organic growth we said we\u2019d get. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess a two-part here on margins. The year-to-year improvement flow sharply is as you clearly forecast, the comps are getting tougher. But, can you give us some color at the segment level, in particular Resources turning down quite a bit and financials actually quite strong. How do we think about it going forward? What\u2019s impacting, particularly Resources? Thank you.","Jerre Stead","Gary, Resources margins were 43.8% for the quarter, which is the second highest in history with the continued downturn going on from a revenue standpoint. So, 43.8% is a very good performance. And if you think about us going into 2018, as we flatten out on a revenue basis. I think, go ahead Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about resources coming in for the year. We\u2019ve maintained on a full year basis a 43% margin, which is actually up a bit from last year, down a little bit in the quarter. But, I think in general, what I said coming into the year was we thought that we could maintain a flattish type margin in Resources. I mean, we do have revenue decline in Resources. And so, I think we\u2019ve done an effective job of managing cost structure and certainly have gotten some benefit, from some of the synergy reductions in shared services. Transport, good strong margin, and when we look year-to-date, we\u2019re up 250 plus points and that\u2019s area we continue to invest in and we\u2019ve talked about that. I mean, we are continuing to invest in what has been a very strong area and driving significant margin.","I think CMS in the quarter, you have the Boiler code and we\u2019re very transparent about the code. But if we look year-to-date, up a little bit, and certainly that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve done a lot of things strategically in terms of consolidating products in TMT and I think in the specs and standards area with the work bench that will allow us to take more revenue and more margin flow through. And Financial Services has had a very solid year and very strong performance.","If we look, what we\u2019re seeing about the guidance, to Peter\u2019s earlier question, it\u2019s not a deceleration. If you look at where we\u2019re at on the guidance, we\u2019re -- and you cancel it out, you\u2019re looking at a Q4, which is 351 to 364 range, so in line with what we\u2019re seeing. We typically expect Q4 to be up a bit sequentially. We did call out the fact that transfer -- we did get a benefit by pulling in some revenue on recall related to Ducati in this quarter. And so, I think that, probably dampens the seasonal strength that we would typically expect to see in Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Hey, Todd or Jerre, I wondered, could you frame -- you talked about some of the delta in the EBITDA being, it sounded like FX and then a step up in the IT. Is there any way to size what the total impact from the IT was and just how you\u2019re thinking about delta in EBITDA overall?","Jerre Stead","That\u2019s great. Go ahead, Todd. Good question.","Todd Hyatt","Well, I mean, I went through the list. The code and you can run the code, I mean it\u2019s $9 million of revenue and relatively low margin. So, we end up with probably 30 points when we look at the code. I think on talking about the mark-to-market, that\u2019s another 30 points, some of the IT investment, 25 to 30 points. So, I think those are really the big items. I mean, the other one -- FX as dollar weakens, we now have more revenue but we end up with more expense. And we talk about the natural offsetting, hedges that we tend to have at the P&L level, but weakening dollar does have a bit of an impact on FX -- on the margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Todd, on the Resources ACV, you said flat third quarter and modest growth in fiscal fourth quarter. I assume those are sequential comments. And so, if we have that, fourth quarter ACV will still be down year-over-year by my view. And with that, is Resources subscription revenue poised to be up in 2018?","Todd Hyatt","Well, we\u2019re at $10 million negative year-to-date and I said modest growth in Q4. So, may not get all the way to flat, but I think essentially you can call it a flat sub-base that we\u2019re growing off of as we\u2019re moving into 2018. And then, the math is really the sales growth. If you look at a ratable model, the sales growth will get 50% of that. So, if we can just simple -- the math behind it, if we can grow sales of 4% in 2018, that would convert into a 2% organic revenue grower.","Jerre Stead","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Steinerman","Total question?","Todd Hyatt","It\u2019s just the sub part of the business. And the other thing I should add is on the sub base, we talk about the sub-base but we don\u2019t include OPIS in that sub base. So, we would expect to get additional lift from OPIS, 100 millionish asset that\u2019s been growing very high single digit. And then of course the non-sub part of energy, we would expect to improve in 2018 as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My question is a little bit more topical, and maybe referring to what Todd mentioned in there around IT investments. And I guess I was just -- wanted a little bit more color on what those investments are and maybe tied to that, if you could just talk about your spend on cyber security and your efforts and how you fill positioned there?","Jerre Stead","Yes. That\u2019s a good one. Pick it up, Lance. It\u2019s been a lot of time on.","Lance Uggla","Yes. So, part of these deep dives that Jerre mentioned, there were 67 dives into all of our different business lines; so, from the four divisions, broken down to 67 subareas. And those deep dives included people, technology, customers and product innovation or debt or tech innovation or tech depth. So, we really, really did a thorough look at all the businesses over the course of a past three months. And so, within there of course, things like info security penetration testing, business recovery testing, really looking at our platforms and building out a solid enterprise risk management approach to how we run our company is very, very important. And of course some of that requires a little bit of investment ongoing to make sure that we are at a benchmark level that puts us in the place we want to be. So, we have increased a little bit of investment on the back end of that in terms of platforms, info security and making sure that we feel we\u2019re in a really good spot.","The second thing is, is the world shifting to the cloud. And the fact is, is as we shift to gain operating leverage and to improve performance and create more customer opportunities, the cloud is an important tool for us. But, of course, when you take an existing installed customer base and you start offering a cloud offering adjacent to it, one doesn\u2019t go away when the other one starts. And we\u2019re going to have a small overlap of that, but that to me is money well spent and is important to our go forward revenue growth. And so, well done, team.","And then the final one, I would say is that we have two companies coming together and we want to have one data science platform as we said with one capability to fuel our revenue growth. And we\u2019re fueling a lot of good strong revenue synergies which we called out. We see confidence in taking that forward, but again, those platform investments, they\u2019re not free, they\u2019re ones that we want to make, and they\u2019ve showed up a little bit here in the quarter. And the team has done a great job. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Financial Services, tech and in particular as it relates to MiFID II. I know the question has come up in the past and I know you\u2019re working on some new products. But, in terms of just spending going up for everyone, are you seeing hesitance to spend on your existing products with clients already as we get closer? And then most importantly, any updated thoughts on the -- what it means for over the counter processing services and interest rate swaps et cetera?","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Lance -- multifaceted, Alex. So, the first thing is I think shareholders in IHS Markit are looking for us to take advantage of financial market changes. And our team are exceptional at positioning our products to meet regulatory change. It\u2019s a key tenant of what we do and continue to do and therefore bringing up and highlighting MiFID II and many of the regulations surrounding that. IHS Markit is the leading, well-positioned firm to access new revenues with respect to MiFID II and what it brings on for the marketplace. And the teams have shown excellent progress quarter-over-quarter. But regulatory change is a -- it\u2019s a marathon, it\u2019s not instantaneous that dates move, dates change, but what I can tell you is the team is doing what they\u2019re supposed to do and the revenue will come when it\u2019s supposed to come. So, that\u2019s all I can say on MiFID II. But, we\u2019re well-positioned and that hasn\u2019t changed.","The second thing I\u2019d say is that in terms of OTC derivative processing, it is a very small amount, small part of our overall business now. You\u2019re talking single-digit revenues overall. And then that\u2019s broken down in terms of electronic, non-electronic, loans versus credit versus rates versus FX and there is a lot of growth engines in any one quarter and there is many volume decreases in any quarter. But the absolute amount is very manageable and we see ourselves very well-positioned. I think two things we like. We like businesses where we\u2019ve got a core underlying strength in data and from that, we can produce our competitive products across the firm, research, analytics, insights, consulting, valuations, pricing indices and we also like where we have a network. And a network gives you the strength to connect your customers and take advantage of market opportunities as they arise and process into variable. It\u2019s a small variable, you deal with it when market is standalone, it\u2019s less prominent when we\u2019re together, but nothing\u2019s changed on that side. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","On the early 2018 margin commentary, I just want to make sure I have it right. Are you saying, is a 100 basis points the right framework or is that the right floor level, given that you had good underlying margin expansion plus you\u2019re still layering on incremental net OpEx synergies? And then, Todd, could you just be a little bit more clear on the expected impact from the non-operating items. Do you expect those to impact reported adjusted EBITDA and\/or reported adjusted EPS, what are those?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean, the 100 basis points is really the framework that we provided on a long-term basis relative to margin expansion. That\u2019s certainly a level we expect to achieve in all forward years. On the non-operational items that I went through, those are really the items, the low adjusted EBITDA to adjusted EPS. And so, what I talked about is some of the headwinds that we\u2019ll face on those items as we continue to term out our capital structure or our underlying debt structure, the fact that the comparison on the tax rate will be challenged, but still within the longer term guidance. So, we\u2019ll provide specific numbers, when we get to the November call. But certainly expect some headwind at the adjusted EPS level. But as I said, I would characterize those as non-operational. And on a longer term basis, when we cycle through those items, when we cycle through the completing the term out of the debt structure, we wouldn\u2019t expect those to be impactful to the longer term ability to drive to the double-digit earnings growth.","Jerre Stead","Do you want to wrap that up, Lance?","Lance Uggla","Yes. I just want to add one point. I think the key thing about the team and Jerre and I laying out Investor Day with the team last year. The first and we really wanted you to shift and understand the journey that we\u2019re taking as a information services company. So first thing is we\u2019ve given you renewed confidence on mid-40s. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said, that was an adjustment upwards at investment day -- Investor Day and we reaffirmed it today and really want you to look in your forward models that this is a company that can hit mid-40s. But of course, the other size of that is, are you going to get there next year, are you going to get there the following year, is it going to take you five years. And what we\u2019ve given you is a baseline of 100 basis points a year. Those two things you can model very conservative, take 100 basis points a year and go one-by-one sequentially; or two, you can put in hill, valley, whatever you want in terms of your planning, but our view is we\u2019ve got the operational leverage to mid-40s and we\u2019re going to deliver a 100 basis points. That\u2019s all we\u2019re saying and we\u2019re not put in timeframes on that. But it\u2019s very important that we keep doing what we say we\u2019re going to do. ","Jerre Stead","Lance, just to add to that organic growth too, because that\u2019s the other piece of that equation.","Lance Uggla","100%. 4 to 6, we want to get solidly into 4 to 6, so we can start saying we\u2019re there. And then, like I said before, we\u2019re not going to be sat at 3 and we\u2019re not going to brag at 7, but 4 to 6 is a range that we feel confident as a leadership team that we can operate in and that produces the long-term earnings per share growth that we want.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to the margin question that was asked before. Jerre, I\u2019m not used to seeing you guys point to the EBITDA margin at the lower end of the guidance range. And I just want to get a little bit more understanding of the breakdown of that. Like, how much of that is accelerating IT, how much of that is probably we\u2019re going to see from every company reporting increased cyber security costs. To the extent that you are accelerating some investments, does that mean that they\u2019re going to have a payoff that\u2019s near-term in 2018? Just if there is a way to just break some of this stuff down for us?","Jerre Stead","Yes, good question. Todd?","Todd Hyatt","I went though, in the script, I talked about first, we have what I\u2019ll just non-operational item. And so, we do have impact from mark-to-market impacting in the other expense. So, you can look at other expense, and it\u2019s primarily that amount. And you can see what that looks like I think year-to-date $6 million. But it\u2019s certainly in the world of margin every dollar counts.","We talked about some of the investments we made. Lance talked about on IT. And that has been an area that we have done some level of investment. And we\u2019ve accelerated the movement to the cloud. And we\u2019ve done a bit of investment in the data, science area as we look to the forward view of the company and strategy of the company. And so, I think those are probably the primary things that I would call out. But I think as I said, we\u2019re delivering a solid year. We\u2019ve driven some level of improvement in revenue and certainly pushing revenue to the high end of the guidance range, we feel good about pushing up towards the higher end of the organic growth range. And that\u2019s allowed us to make some trade; we continue to invest heavily in automotive. We talked about that. And we have very strong growth when we look at both the new car and the use car parts of that portfolio. So, I think a bit of investment in some of the MiFID II areas that Lance talked about. So, there is some level of investment. And at the end of the day, we\u2019re in this for the long-term and we\u2019re not going to ring out the last dollar of margin in any given quarter if we see opportunity to continue to grow the business.","Jerre Stead","And drive up into the organic growth range that we\u2019ve committed too. Thank you, great question. Next?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Andrew Jeffrey","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Lance and Jerre, as you look at the Auto footprint and the franchise which is showing impressive growth and obviously strong results. Can you talk about I guess two things, one, the competitive environment. And who you see as your primary competitors, both in the CARFAX and also the Polk, and if that\u2019s changed at all? And then, two, from an technological capability perspective, it feels like the solutions suite is well built, would CRM be something you\u2019re focused on? Just a little bit more color on the strategic thoughts would be awesome. Thanks.","Jerre Stead","Yes, great question. I\u2019ll just start with a reminder of everybody. IHS was not in the automotive business until October of 2008, zero revenue. When we acquired Global Insight that was our beginning and it was $25 million. Today, you can see the numbers, we\u2019re exiting with and with the addition that of the acquisition we just made with autoMastermind, that\u2019s going to take us another significant step forward. So, feel really good about the progress with that. And I\u2019ll have Lance comment on your question because it\u2019s a really important one. Strategically, we now have a business that is a leader, as Lance said when we\u2019re covering the acquisition earlier and this going continue to be a leader and outpace the competition that Lance will talk about.","Lance Uggla","Right. So, I guess mentioned that a little bit earlier, this whole digitization of the servicing of that automotive franchise. And as a long-term data player, if you look at IHS Markit automotive or you look at CARFAX, CARPROOF in Canada, CARFAX building in Europe and now Mastermind, these are at their core are leveraging data and analytics to build out a products suite. And that product suite serves both, OEMs and the dealer franchises. So, I feel that we\u2019re very diversified. And actually there isn\u2019t a single competitor that takes us on an automotive. There might be a few of them in each of the segments but we\u2019re clearly the automotive information services leader globally. There is no question about that.","So, what have we done here? We wanted to go deeper and we want to go deeper when we acquire, not just for high growth of the asset but for the synergies that the combination provides. That\u2019s very important for us. And I think Todd\u2019s called out, over the whole firm on the acquisition about 1% of acquired growth which will flow through into 2018 on the back of Mastermind. And that\u2019s very important because it\u2019s deepening that dealer franchise. And the dealer franchise is actually participating with the OEMs in the $20 billion advertising spend, big number; and two, the $50 billion incentive spend. And what\u2019s important for us is that we\u2019re a market leader in terms of the data and analytics and the predictive analytics that extracts value from that relationship. And again, we feel a market leadership position in that and one that we can grow for many years.","So, very well-position, very well-diversified; we were deep, now we\u2019re deeper. And we\u2019ve got the prongs, whether it\u2019s our regulatory franchise around emissions, whether it\u2019s our CARFAX and CARPROOF franchises, whether it\u2019s our Mastermind franchise, but what\u2019s most important is bringing those together and producing incremental synergies and building those out with just a world-class team as we look forward into 2018 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anj Singh","I wanted to ask question on the Automotive Mastermind acquisition. What does the customer set here look like in the future to you? Do you see an opportunity to expand out of the dealer network for sales perhaps, the OEMs or Financial Services or is that really just the opportunity penetrating the dealers? And anything you can share on the competitive landscape?","Jerre Stead","No. Great question. Go.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So, again, the piece of the puzzle that we\u2019ve called out historically and we\u2019ll continue to call out is digital marketing. And this is a world that\u2019s changing every day, and it\u2019s driven by data and the predictive analytics applied to the data. We were already doing that, we do it in all of our automotive franchise businesses now and Mastermind complements that. We see the digital marketing, if you take this $20 billion advertising spends historically and think about print and Super Bowl and many of the other historical ways of advertising, assume that that\u2019s changing going forward, because of targeted advertising, whether it\u2019s television, whether it\u2019s print, whether it\u2019s direct mail. The digitization of that spend is going to companies we never heard of years ago Pinterest, Facebook, Google and the likes. And we need to continue to build out our franchise to make sure that we\u2019re participating to the maximum level in that change. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s the shift that you have to start thinking about. I know SAARs is interesting overall. But for us, it\u2019s the spend and leveraging our data into the spend; that\u2019s what our team is doing a great job and will continue to do so. ","Todd Hyatt","Well, the other thing I would add when we talk about the customer set, Mastermind, really focused today on dealer market in the U.S. And so, if we look at our automotive franchise, CARFAX, used car dealer market in the U.S., Mastermind, new car dealer market and then Polk, very heavy with the OEMs and suppliers. And what we see with Mastermind is we see the ability to use data across those different markets. So, we see the ability to use some of the Polk information to better support Mastermind. Today, Mastermind is a Polk customer, Mastermind can use more and more of the Polk information and the CARFAX information. But we also see ability to ultimately expand internationally. So, if we look at CARFAX, today CARFAX Europe, and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but we\u2019re at a point now in CARFAX Europe where Dick and team have done a really good job of building out of data asset in Europe. Now, it\u2019s still relatively small, but moving to breakeven level of profitability. And we see now a position where we can use Mastermind and we can take advantage of some of the infrastructure that we\u2019ve build in Europe. And certainly Mastermind solution is something that is very transferable into other market. So, we do see this really extending our reach and extending our ultimate addressable market and longer term revenue growth opportunities.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","Hi. I wondered if you can give us some color on how cross-selling opportunities have progressed for IHS Markit, maybe we could quantify it. And I just wanted to confirm the Mastermind is in the your guidance as well. Thanks.","Lance Uggla","So, we called out in the -- what I would call the earnings call today that we have gained confidence in our revenue synergies. And that\u2019s really just pulling the teams together and seeing quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter incremental improvements in the absolute dollar amount of synergies. And a lot of that has come through taking IHS legacy products and bringing those into the financial markets. And that\u2019s proved to be the low-hanging fruit that we thought it would be in terms of existing products that are already built and then bringing them into the financial markets. So, that\u2019s step one. Step two, we made some interesting wins that we called out on Investor Day and we\u2019ve called out before to you is where we\u2019ve taken our data management technology, tied it together with our financial markets expertise, especially around credit and been able to provide a service into the large energy companies to help them better manage complex sets of data, to reduce costs, check; and then two, to be able to analyze the credit risk component of the private companies that they\u2019re dealing with in what is an increasingly broad and broad market that they\u2019re actually lending into through the goods and services they provide with their counterparties. And we have an expertise in financial markets of understanding that risk component from the credit perspective. So, those are just the couple of areas, but equally they spread across technology, automotive. They cover global regions. And I have to say this is -- it\u2019s a great team doing exactly what Jerre and I expected them to do around revenues. And we like the progress.","Jerre Stead","And every week, just so you know how important it is, we review that with our leadership team, because it\u2019s coming. Todd, pick up the last set of the questions.","Todd Hyatt","I appreciate the question on the guidance and it is not in the numbers. So, what we would expect is and talk about the full year revenue of $50 million and certainly given the growth trajectory we\u2019ll have two months of revenue. So, you can pencil out another approximately $10 million of revenue; from an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we it\u2019s in the release that single digit in 2018, it\u2019s flat to slightly dilutive today. But, we would expect to accommodate that in the existing EBITDA guidance. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Hey, good morning. Jerre, congrats on your second last earnings call. Todd, you reiterated the $1 billion buyback target for 2018. And you\u2019re bumping up against the high end of your target leverage range right now. You\u2019ve announced the $400 million acquisition, your free cash flow is somewhere around $900 million a year. So, at some point it seems like you\u2019ll need to raise some cash. So, should we be thinking about a new leverage target above the two to three times gross leverage or would you just expect to stick with that for now? Thanks.","Jerre Stead","Great question, Toni.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re at two-seven on a bank basis at quarter-end so that\u2019s pre-AMM. So, I think AMM in the quarter will push us up slightly above three times, but we would expect to be down toward the three times by year-end. And then, when we look at the cash that you talked about, the $900 million of cash and increasing capacity that supports the $1 billion within the current target leverage. And that\u2019s how we intend to operate. I think one of the things I did talk about in call is the timing of the buyback, and we\u2019ll manage the timing of the buyback, probably pushes that out a bit, we\u2019ll look at opportunity to see how much of that we can front load, but I think we are comfortable operating in the leverage target that we provided. Thanks, Toni.","Jerre Stead","Thanks. Last question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our final question Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. As you guys look at the portfolio today, maybe you could give us a sense of how much opportunity there is on the product or platform side remaining relative to lead generation and sales force efficiencies? I know you talked about the 100-bp margin expansion each year, but just give us a flavor for that. Thank you.","Jerre Stead","Yes. It\u2019s a great question. Lance will answer that. Again reminding everybody how those 67 deep dives have given us a very good view on that. I\u2019ll start by saying, we\u2019ve got lots of room for years to come, but pick up on it.","Lance Uggla","Right. So, part of the deep dives were around the third model and as we look forward, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have the best combination of account management and direct sales that supports our businesses. Beneath that, we need to have the technology. And one of the first moves that we made was a significant investment in sales force across firm, and that\u2019s rolling out at the -- starting to the first stage of the rollout here at the end of the year and will complete in the first quarter.","And that gives us a platform to share information globally that definitely supports our sales activities in a more efficient way. Coming out of the back of that, of course like all, we have different sales methodologies. We have direct sales, we have inside sales and e-sales, and the platform needs to be tuned to support each of those in a way that gives us the best operating leverage.","And then, finally, I\u2019d say that historically a combination of what we call sales ops and customer care, we\u2019ve been focused through the integration to leverage again our operational capabilities across all three of those in a way that gives us the best cost revenue ratios as well as supports the best levers for sales growth. I\u2019d probably stop there. I think again, the team -- these are real worked exercises, they\u2019re ones that we have clear defined goals, plans. And having Jerre and I here together this year in the way we\u2019ve been operating has given me a whole bunch of time to focus on next year and Jerry to focus on this year. And I have to say, the partnership is one that\u2019s been outstanding and will be missed.","Jerre Stead","And we\u2019ll wrap up with that. By the way, great set of questions. This is number 62 of my calls I\u2019ve made with you all, just at IHS Markit. So, I\u2019ll do one more, and we\u2019ll do our best to make it a great one for you, but very thoughtful questions.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter, are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes its non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit\u2019s filings with SEC and the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 earnings call. We are pleased with our Q1 results as we continue to perform within expectations. We are making excellent progress on the integration of Ipreo and our post merger strategic initiatives.","Key financial highlights of the quarter are: revenue of $1.046 million, up 5% on an organic basis and 12% overall; solid growth in transportation, financial services and resources; adjusted EBITDA of $408 million and margin of 39% with continued strong expansion; finally, adjusted EPS of $0.60, up 13% over the prior year.","Let me now provide some segment highlights. Transportation continued to produce solid results with organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter in line with our high single-digit guidance. We continue to benefit from our diversification across the auto sector\u2019s entire value chain. The strongest growth drivers in the quarter included our auto forecasting, Carfax Used Card Listing and automotiveMastermind businesses. Financial services reported strong results with 6% organic growth with strength across our information and solutions businesses in a diversified fashion. In particular, a strong quarter for pricing, managed loan services, reg in compliance and in our software businesses, analytics and EDM performed well. Ipreo results had strong growth in corporate services and private capital markets offset somewhat by lower equity issuance. We have since seen a pickup in deal flow.","CMS organic revenue was minus 3% as our TMT business was impacted by the uncertainty of a larger contract renewal. Our product design in ECR businesses performed as expected. We expect CMS organic growth to be in the low single-digits for the year. In resources, we delivered our strongest quarter since 2015 with 6% organic growth and we remain confident in our organic revenue growth outlook for 2019. Our view supported by industry trends, the growth of our trailing 12-month annual contract value, strong non-recurring revenue pipeline and continued investment in innovation. CERAWeek, our global energy conference had record attendance, up 20% year-over-year with over 5,000 attendees. This year, CERAWeek was diversified across energy markets and also across our firm with strong plenary participation in mobility, technology and finance. The energy industry is in the early stages of increasing its investment in advanced technologies to gain greater insights and to increase efficiency. IHS Markit is well positioned to partner with industry to help in these efforts. Overall, we were pleased with another solid quarter of execution and financial results.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. As Lance discussed, our Q1 results were in line with our expectations and included revenue of $1.046 billion, organic growth of 5% and total revenue growth of 12%, net income of $109 million and GAAP EPS of $0.27, adjusted EBITDA of $408 million, an increase of 14% with margin of 39.0% and adjusted EPS of $0.60, an increase of $0.07 or 13%. Relative to revenue, our Q1 organic revenue growth of 5% included stable recurring organic growth of 5% and non-recurring organic growth of 8%.","Looking at segment performance, transportation organic revenue growth was 8%. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring and 4% non-recurring. Resources organic revenue growth was 6%. Organic growth was comprised of 5% recurring and 16% non-recurring. Recurring and total organic growth benefited by 1% each point from favorable timing associated with software sales impacted by the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Our Q1 organic ACV increased $3 million on a trailing 12-month organic ACV increased $26 million to $738 million, which was up 4% versus prior year. We continued to trend at an ACV level supportive of our 2019 revenue expectation. CMS organic revenue declined 3%. Organic revenue was negatively impacted by uncertainty of a contract renewal in our TMT business.","Recurring organic was flat and non-recurring organic declined 20% in part due to $2 million from Boiler Code. We expect approximately $10 million of organic revenue growth in second half of the year from the Boiler Code. We now expect CMS organic growth in the low single-digits excluding Boiler Code. Financial services total revenue growth was 28% including organic revenue growth of 6%, acquisitive growth of 24% and negative 1% FX. Recurring organic growth was 4%, non-recurring organic increased $7 million or 37%. Information organic revenue increased 5%, led by strength in our pricing and reference data and valuation services business.","Derivative processing volumes were strong while loan market volumes were soft resulting a net processing organic decline of 3%. Solutions organic revenue increased 12%. Growth was led by loan services business and analytics and EDM software. Our Ipreo business delivered $76 million of revenue and is on track to deliver throughout full year adjusted EBITDA target of $115 million, but we expect revenue at the lower end of our $350 million to $370 million guidance range.","Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $408 million, up $49 million or 14% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.0%, up 80 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX and up 40 basis points on a reported basis. Regarding segment profitability, transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $114 million with a margin of 39.7%, down 100 basis points due to lower margin recall revenue and higher marketing spend in our CARFAX business to support forward product initiatives. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $93 million with the margin of 43.0%, up 160 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with the margin of 22.2%, down 90 basis points. Financial services delivered strong margin with adjusted EBITDA of $183 million, margin of 44.8%, up 290 basis points normalized for Ipreo and down 70 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.60 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 13% improvement. Our GAAP tax rate was minus 1% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. Q1 free cash flow was $125 million. As expected, Q1 cash was seasonally low due to bonus payments. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow was $1.04 billion and represented a conversion rate of 65%.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter end debt balance was $5.6 billion, which was down $83 million from prior year end and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.4x on a bank covenant basis. Our in-quarter bank covenant leverage was impacted by lapping a prior year tax benefit from tax reform. We continue to track to our target to de-lever below 3x in Q3. Finally, we closed the quarter with $133 million of cash and our year end undrawn revolver balance was approximately $700 million. Our Q1 weighted average diluted share count was 408 million shares. In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our prior guidance. Full year guidance provides for revenue of $4.425 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including Ipreo 4-month stub period organic contribution. Including Ipreo for 12 months would increase total organic growth to 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.78 billion, including adjusted EBITDA of $115 million from Ipreo, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 100 basis points normalized per FX and excluding Ipreo and 80 basis point margin expansion including Ipreo, adjusted EPS of $2.52 to $2.57, which represents adjusted EPS growth of 11% at guidance midpoint.","Finally, we expect cash conversion in line with our mid-60s target or more than $1.1 billion of free cashflow. In terms of capital allocation, we are focused on de-levering to below 3x and resuming our share buyback. We expect to buyback $500 million of stock in the second half of the year.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. I am pleased with our start to 2019 and believe we are well-positioned to deliver upon our financial commitments for the year. The teams continue to deliver strong diversified revenue growth and margin expansion, while making the right level of investment to be able to sustain strong long-term financial returns for our shareholders. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess the first question on Ipreo, can we get anymore color, do you think that government shutdown was really the issue and that it was equity underwriting and that normalizes or is there anything else that leads you to think revenue for the year comes in at the lower end of the prior target?","Lance Uggla","No, I think we definitely saw equity market slowdown. Government shutdown definitely played into that lower level of volumes. But since we have seen pickup and the other businesses are performing as planned and so we are confident with that 350 to 370 range and guided to the lower end of it. I think the other pieces is a bit \u2013 well, just answer that operator, then we will go to second one is that we have also reaffirmed. The team has done a great job on the cost side and we have reaffirmed the 115 target as well. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. So basically, Lance it seems like the operating results pretty broadly are in line with the guidance you played out, so is there anything you would call out in terms of things that are surprising you here for positive or negative that you are seeing in the current results?","Lance Uggla","I think the and hopefully it came out loud and clear throughout the comments this morning is really I think a bit of a story of diversification in what I would say is the solid quarter of results that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s written on the instruction booklet. And I guess while I say diversified in that you have seen energy at the higher end of the range and that\u2019s come from negative growth because the top end of zero and 2, the top end of 2 to 4, we have now laid out 4 to 6 and mid single-digits and we feel really good about that. This was a solid 5% to 6% quarter and Todd called out the adjustment on the accounting rules that gave us a bit of a lift. But we feel really, really good about energy and then followed on with CERAWeek that had something like 5,500 people crossing right across mobility, finance, technology, big new sponsors Amazon, Microsoft, both they are sponsoring, Google Cloud sponsoring the conferences. And it just shows that we are right at the heart beat of data, data science, technology and the intersection into our industrial segments. So I think we \u2013 that bodes well. CERAWeek is a good barometer for the energy markets and I think that bodes well. So diversified in that in order for us to hit our guidance in the previous couple of years, we are always kind of pulled very fondly by automotive, no pun intended, but they kind of towed us up to the higher end. And energy was something we are covering and financial markets putting in a core set of results tending to the higher end at the end of last year. The other thing diversified within, so if you look at financial markets, even processing it\u2019s down, but the fact is as you have got derivatives doing well in loan processing, so it\u2019s a mix bag, things that have always been strong pricing, the private capital markets business, indices, all doing well and continued to do well. And then in automotive it was a bit of shift, Mastermind is doing well. The old core forecasting business is doing well and CARFAX continuing to storm ahead. That mix is slightly different than the digital marketing mix and recall that we are seeing last year. So I think when I talk to the team it was solid quarter and it\u2019s really nice to see that we are not relying on single parts of the company to carry it \u2013 carry our guidance. And \u2013 but the combination of the business is great. I think EBITDA performance across several of our businesses was stellar as well in terms of expanding margin. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. My question was just on the energy business, so Todd just to confirm the \u2013 I guess the one point benefit this quarter, could you just talk about how we should think of that for the full year. And last just on your industry trends I was hoping if there was anything from CERAWeek specifically that you could talk to in terms of your positive outlook on energy?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. But I think the one point we will watch through the year Manav, I mean I think it will be neutral by the time we get to year end. So when we look at the software products within energy they are generally pretty short-term licensing, so there is a little bit of variability in the timing with the new standard. 6% is certainly a point ahead of where we would have expected to be at this time, but we still feel very good about energy, solidly moving into the mid single-digits. And then I think on the non-recurring non-energy, consulting was good. And Lance talked about CERAWeek coming off of a pretty strong CERAWeek in March, so I think we are well positioned as we move forward through the rest of the year.","Lance Uggla","As I have said at the time of guidance Manav, I have said that across the firm we expected the rev\/rec to be neutral to $10 million drag and then we will provide color as we go through the year. It creates a little bit of \u2013 I think the big thing it will create some in-quarter variability, but full year, we would expect it to generally be somewhat neutral.","Todd Hyatt","Good. So on the second part of your question I think there was two themes that kind of gave a interesting tone towards the upside as I would see it from IHS Markit perspective from CERAWeek. So I think one of the first themes, that\u2019s overriding the energy markets of course is climate. So that bodes well for a company that is well-positioned to consult across up mid and downstream energy activities. You have got the whole LNG markets are very interesting in terms of playing into climate change and the strong supply. And so of course, our consulting teams which then feed into our data products that bodes well. Also climate driving another component that intersects well with financial markets in that whole ESG and measurement of compliance by companies and the investment appetites of the investment markets and how those intersect and come together, that bodes really well for our energy market consultants, coupled with the financial markets, but also our recent acquisition of Ipreo plays well into that as well. I think what was interesting is the intersection is well at CERAWeek of technology and the fact that industry participants are definitely grappling with data, more data than they ever had before and how to manage it, how to share it, distribute it, exchange it between themselves and the vendors in a way that can provide market efficiencies, but also to help them to manage their businesses better and that bodes well for where we sit in the energy marketplace. So I think lots around climate plays in well to a data provider like ourselves as people are analyzing forward policy strategy investments. And then I would say the other one is geopolitics and just the state of the world in terms of whether it\u2019s Venezuela, sanctions in Iran, potential trade wars or settling of trade wars between U.S. and China and that bodes and plays into supply and demand scenarios that again we are a world leader in providing forecast into the upstream energy markets to help decisions around exploration and production. And so I felt that is a strong underlying theme. So yes, I think that all bodes well for where we positioned, I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance, but I think that it helps us reaffirm our guidance and look forward throughout the year and say this is going to be a solid performance for our teams with respect to energy. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. Just wanted to push a little bit more in Ipreo, because you kind of took down the lower end of the range to risk adjust from the original guidance a couple of quarters ago and now just guiding towards the low end of the maintained range. So just in that context, I understand equity issuance with macro and the government shutdown weaker in Q1, but as you observed it\u2019s picked back up. So, I guess are you \u2013 is this just one quarter of lower equity origination moves the needle that much just anything that you could say to kind of reiterate confidence in Ipreo? Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Well, I will start and then I will pass to Todd. So I guess I hope you have got used to 3 years of fairly conservative set of forward-looking guidance and we do want to set the right stage. And one thing about Ipreo, it\u2019s similar to derivatives. I hate the fact that any volume based businesses to me judge any particular quarter. What I care about is the fact that our assets whether they are the equity muni bond markets that are driving Ipreo results or whether they are loan processing or interest rate derivative processing or valuations of derivatives. Things that are volume related that really are outside of our control, so we have to guide with our best expectations of an annual marketplace. And since we acquired Ipreo, the markets have been a little bit quitter and there is no cost adjustment with respect to the equity piece which is very volume oriented. And so at this point we looked at our year, we have said we are going to have 5% to 6% organic growth here. We are reaffirming that today. We are into our second quarter. We feel hopefully you can feel a sense of confidence in our guidance. We are managing costs well. But I think through you folks, you can put in 350, you can put in 355 or 360, that\u2019s in that lower part of the range, wherever you want to put your models to and that gives us the solid outlook on the year and one that\u2019s appropriate to give you today. Todd, do you want to\u2026","Todd Hyatt","And I think that\u2019s right. I think you called out the Q1 revenue number that was certainly impacted by quitter markets. And I guess implicit in that, we wouldn\u2019t expect to catch all of that up as we move through the year. I mean I think there is \u2013 the markets are certainly much more constructive now. We expect to see a notable pickup in Q2 and see the business performing well for the rest of the year, but I have said at the time we gave guidance that to get to the higher end, things would fall into place well and that would signal some upside and we have protected very well at the 115 level in terms of the margin and so we feel very confident in that number.","Lance Uggla","There is a lot of chatter in the marketplace in terms of tech issuance, the likes of Uber and others all being touted and those all play well for a company like ours, but there is also trade wars and market dialogue that changes things day to day. What I can say if there is issuance there we will be doing it and that could bode very well in the second half or if you took the last 10 years and took the lowest volumes and modeled it out, it will probably put us at the bottom end of that range. And so I think we have given you a good guidance for today. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone.","Lance Uggla","Hi Bill.","Todd Hyatt","Hi Bill.","Bill Warmington","Could you talk about how the indices business is doing overall and comment on how China bond, the partnership that you did in October is doing and what do you think the opportunity is longer term in China?","Lance Uggla","Yes. Well, index business continues to perform well. I know in general if you look at some of the market chatter and where overall indices are \u2013 index volumes are amongst some of the bigger players you would think there would be more volatility. But actually our group, we are one of the world\u2019s \u2013 the two world leaders in fixed income bond indices and those volumes and levels have continued to perform well. So we are \u2013 we haven\u2019t experienced any significant change to our business there. In terms of our China bond index, I would say that the reception has been good. I don\u2019t have the exact numbers to provide you. It\u2019s something that you could follow-up with Eric on, but all I can say is that we are progressing, we have had great meetings, great reception and given that we are the only player that\u2019s working directly with the China bond as a partner. I think we have a competitive edge and that will bode well for the future. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Tim McHugh","Yes. I just want to follow-up maybe a little bit differently on the financial services, can you talk about is the growth rate of the \u2013 if we excluded the equity portion, is that consistent with what you thought and is that still kind of double-digit growth as you talked in the past?","Lance Uggla","We expect Ipreo to be double-digit growth, yes. Were you referring to Ipreo or our index business?","Tim McHugh","Yes, Ipreo.","Todd Hyatt","Ipreo, yes.","Lance Uggla","Yes, okay. No, no, definitely our view is this Ipreo be a double-digit growth. And I think there is the organic growth in general was very, very strong in the quarter across the business.","Todd Hyatt","iLevel was very strong. The corporate services were strong.","Lance Uggla","Private capital markets strong. So, I don\u2019t think there is any \u2013 we don\u2019t have any cautionary flags whatsoever except that we can\u2019t measure the volume and it was lower than expected. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Todd, I had always thought in the past that the resources ACV was a leading indicator of IHS Resources organic revenue growth. Just tell me if you agree with that and given that the resources organic revenue growth is now growing faster than ACV do you expect ACV to kind of bump up to the level where resources organic is?","Lance Uggla","No, I think the way you said it\u2019s the right way to think about it, Andrew. I mean, the ACV is the forward indicator. ACV growth on a trailing 12-month basis is 4%. The reported organic is ahead of that. I called out a percentage point of that was due to the new rev\/rec standard. Within any quarter, I say there is potential of a point plus or minus just from contract renewal timing that can impact, but we have ACV right now, it\u2019s 4% we see that continuing to move up and that given I think with the context that Lance provides, it give us a high level of confidence that resources will certainly be in the mid single-digits this year.","Andrew Steinerman","Thanks, Todd. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. Yes, my question was on the transportation side, so continuously some good momentum there. I was just wondering if you can talk about traction for the Conquest marketing product within automotiveMastermind as well as the myCARFAX new product launch, how is that coming along and then just maybe quickly on the non-recurring side, any kind of visibility that you have on the recall activity there? Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Maybe I will start and then I will pass to Todd. So the first thing is yes, we called out three areas of strong performance in the quarter, which slightly different than maybe previous quarters that was Mastermind and of course, the Conquest product launched in the quarter, so we have got a quarter of results and that was a strong participant. Second, it\u2019s too soon on CARFAX for Life, it was just launched in the new year, so you are really seeing that launch play into Q2, but the team worked right through 2018 to be ready for that early this year launch and they have got the product out and it\u2019s too early to give you any forecast except it\u2019s a well-developed product that will play well into the service lane and support future growth. Used car listings continues where smaller \u2013 the smaller participants, but with very high growth rates. And again I think quarter by quarter CARFAX and used car listings is one of their new innovative products over the last few years continues to grow and then just the underlying core automotive business with the whole, everybody wants to know impact of EVs, what\u2019s the future of ride-sharing programs, how does that affect componentary in cars. So the whole automotive forecasting becomes quite interesting and so another good performer. On the lumpier side recall, which is lower margin I think Todd called it out in some of the financials as well as digital marketing post Facebook, those which have been strong growers last year coming off slightly. So the mix of product is slightly different, but solid 8% organic growth and we are very pleased. Yes, recurring transport 9% and the non-recurring a bit lower and you see some of that variability in the non-recurring. The recurring feel very good about the continued performance at that level that very high single-digit level. There will be some variability in the non-recurring, recall certainly introduces a level of variability, but we don\u2019t see it being hugely profit impacting. So, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we continue to see very strong growth drivers throughout the Transportation segment and feel very good about the guidance we provided on that segment.","Lance Uggla","Good. Thanks, Todd. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. My question is just around whether you think the portfolio can generate positive organic growth in a more significant slowdown. Just any color on cyclicality of the business? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Yes. I think we\u2019ve said before that, I think that our 5% to 6% organic growth target takes us through cyclical change in the industries that we\u2019re in, because a lot of our products are kind of must-haves regardless of the sentiment in the markets they\u2019re in. So, for example, a large piece of the automotive market, 65% of it is used car listings, so that\u2019s not SAARs connected. In fact, if anything, it might be cyclical in a positive way, we don\u2019t call it out that way, but if you wanted to take the other side of that argument, you could. Forecasting, it\u2019s something that the OEMs need regardless of whether they\u2019re going to sell 1 million cars or 5 million cars, whatever the number is going to be, they still need our forecasting. Our emissions products, our regulatory and \u2013 are needed regardless in terms of measuring output regardless of the market environment.","You\u2019ve got Mastermind, which is helping dealers sell cars. Incentives usually go up. In the \u2013 in challenged markets, incentives go up, the whole need for data science around customer retention, customer conquest, service lane activity, those are all positives. So, automotive, I\u2019d say, in general, I believe it\u2019s well cushioned within its upper single-digit range in the cycles that we can see ahead of us in \u201819, \u201820, \u201821.","Energy, energy is interesting. Definitely exploration plays into our upstream, which is the largest piece of our Resources franchise. And \u2013 but explorations is a long \u2013 it\u2019s a long-term view, and the general view is to replace what\u2019s needed by the world economies as well as to fulfill the kind of base demand scenarios. There\u2019s still exploration required, and therefore, I think the markets got into this equilibrium state with oil in the $55 to $65 range, I think we feel very comfortable with our upstream growth continuing. Sub $55, definitely you could see a bit of a change in terms of forward CapEx.","I also love the shift of CapEx. Last year, we were looking at 80%, 85% of global CapEx coming out of the Permian, and this year that shifted completely and you have a much more \u2013 you have much more global or international component to the CapEx, and, of course, our data sets are supporting those activities with all major players. So, I feel that\u2019s one place where cyclicality could come in, but then you have to look at the rest, PGCR, power, gas, renewables, liquid natural gas, U.S. exporter, replacement of coal, energy as a service, plastics, we\u2019re playing in \u2013 our chemicals team are playing in plastics and recycling and how all the big \u2013 just ran a big customer-driven study around plastics. And I just feel like we\u2019re in the hot bed of change with respect to climate. So, I think our PGCR business has continued upward momentum regardless of the energy markets, because policy and strategy is changing.","And then finally in the downstream businesses, those continue to grow at upper single-digits. We\u2019ve \u2013 we made a small little chemicals pricing acquisition. We\u2019ve got our OPIS activities. We are world leaders in coal. We\u2019ve added data science around that in terms of pricing, coal \u2013 coal transportation, supply using some pretty advanced data science and that bodes well. So, again, I think there is a mix there. Upstream definitely got a cyclical component, mid-downstream can definitely hold its own or outperform. And then financial markets, really most of what we do in financial markets, people need regardless of volumes, sometimes when markets are thin, volumes are higher and were paid per trade. Again, yes, maybe in a downward cycle, we get to the lower end of that range, 3% to 5% in a really negative financial markets environment, but we are very well diversified. And so we feel that mid to slightly upper single-digits with the current assets we have bodes well for this year and we kind of reaffirm that today.","And then CMS, a bit of a mute quarter. It\u2019s a smaller division, but in any other division, we wouldn\u2019t call out a contract renewal, but when it sits right in front of you and it\u2019s minus 3%, we\u2019ve got to explain why it is, but there is nothing really to report there and we reaffirmed \u2013 we took from low to mid to say low, that\u2019s probably the year\u2019s hedge. And put it altogether and we still feel really good about our 5% to 6%, our 100 basis points margin and our double-digit earnings growth. So, that was a long-winded answer, but covers the company. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good morning. Your financial services recurring fixed organic revenue growth decelerated to 4% from 7% in the prior quarter despite easier year-ago comps. Can you discuss what drove the deceleration in the recurring business in financial services and what could drive a reacceleration?","Todd Hyatt","I don\u2019t think anything specifically drove it, George, I mean, we had very high growth last year, Q1, Q2. We\u2019ve said that this was a business, the information business is going to perform in the 4% to 6% range. We\u2019ve had a few quarters where we\u2019ve overperformed that. It\u2019s a healthy business performing well and there can be some in-quarter variability, there can be some comparisons to prior years, but there wasn\u2019t a specific item that I would call out in that part of the business, I think we continue to perform very well there. and we had a really strong non-recurring quarter. So, this sort of gets back to Lance\u2019s earlier point, you have \u2013 you\u2019re down a little bit in one area, you are up quite a lot in another area and you put it together and it\u2019s a really strong performance by Adam and the team again.","Lance Uggla","Yes, no, I think it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s nothing specific, but I would say if you take the last 8 or so years and you take that core information business, ex-Ipreo, it\u2019s been 4% to 9%, that\u2019s 2 years I think we\u2019re at low 4s, and then some years we\u2019ve been 7%, 8% or 9%, 3 or 4 years and the rest of the time kind of between 5% or 7%. I don\u2019t think I agree with Todd, nothing to call out there. We\u2019ve reaffirmed the year and I definitely \u2013 I feel our position in the marketplace around our growth engines, private capital markets are positioned in the loan and credit markets, you\u2019ve got lots of private equity moving into private credit, private debt that bodes really well for our businesses, pricing, et cetera.","Our valuations team in more challenged illiquid market valuations if anything that bodes well. Our reg and compliance products and solutions, nobody asked any questions about that anymore, but that\u2019s been consistent double-digit growing now for many quarters and that\u2019s \u2013 that bodes well in this environment. And then the intersections in the organic growth coming from our merger still bodes well. And I think 0.75% to 1% per annum of organic growth coming from merger-related synergies is something that we can look at as a consistent player. So, if we do $30 million to $50 million a year from synergies with respect to cross-sell, new product development, data science analytics across the firm, I think that bodes really well and is in line with the merger and we continue to see that growth.","So \u2013 and that\u2019s because we have a financial markets franchise that\u2019s well regarded, that are \u2013 we\u2019re able to bring our energy, automotive, aerospace and defense, economics products into our customer base. And yes, that all bodes well for where we\u2019re going to end up this year, but it is the first quarter. We\u2019ve got 3 quarters to go, we\u2019ve got 1 month into the second quarter and we feel confident enough to reaffirm where we\u2019re going this year, but again, we never want to get ahead of ourselves. So, I think if you stick with the numbers as laid out, I hope we don\u2019t disappoint you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning, everyone. I feel like I may be asking a similar question that have been asked a few times. But I just, I think Lance you just said it yourself, you still feel very, very confident about the guidance or you may even say you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself, but at the same time, some of the updates we\u2019ve heard today, CMS obviously taking down guidance, Ipreo at the low-end, and in energy, you had this kind of like a benefit that seems to be little bit one-time. So, everything seems to be maybe a softer start, but you\u2019re still very, very confident. So, just want to make sure I hear that correctly, because I think if you look at the run rate right now, there\u2019s a significant step-up that needs to come to make the rest of the year, just maybe I\u2019m hearing that\u2019s right?","Todd Hyatt","Alex, we\u2019ve talked about the seasonality in the business and I think if you go back and you look at the cadence of the business, Q1 just is the lowest quarter for this company, Q2, Q4, two biggest quarters. And so the business performance that we\u2019ve had to-date fully supports the numbers that we\u2019ve committed to on a full-year basis. When you look at Q1 and you look at Q1 versus prior year, it\u2019s a good solid quarter and organic revenue growth of 5%. Resources, yes, we did call it out, but I think the Resources number was probably ahead of where we expected it to be, because of the organic \u2013 because of the revenue accounting change, you normalize that, it\u2019s consistent with where we expected it to be maybe a shade ahead of where we expected it to be. So that one we called out. We \u2013 as Lance said I think CMS, a relatively immaterial event in the context of the company, in the context of CMS, it\u2019s a bigger number, so we called that out.","Certainly, don\u2019t see that being impactful to the company\u2019s full-year performance. And when we look at the significant items that drive forward numbers and we look at ahead into Q2 and talk about things like some of the events that we have in Q2. Lance talked about CERAWeek and the performance that we\u2019ve had there, we feel certainly happy with that performance. And then general improvement in some of the underlying market activities, which we called out. So, I wouldn\u2019t read \u2013 I guess, I think you\u2019re reading too much between the lines, I think it\u2019s a solid quarter. We feel good about the start to the year and certainly have a clear path to deliver on a full-year basis.","Lance Uggla","Yes, I guess, if I add it to that and I always like to have maths that works when we give guidance and I kind of look at our four divisions and look at what are things that give me confidence in delivering 5% to 6% organic growth for the year. And if you take energy, if you want to take the 1% away from the software and you think energy is going to come in at 5%, you look at CMS and you go, well, they took away mids, it\u2019s going to be 2% to 3%. You look at financial markets, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 always it never fell below 4%, you could even put that at the lower end and you\u2019ve got high single-digits, 7% to 9%, 9% recurring this quarter if you\u2019re at even 7% or 8%. When you put that altogether, you still end up north of 5% and gives us great confidence to give a quarterly guidance at 5% to 6%. And I agree with Todd, I feel very solid, but also I think we also have a reputation of making sure that you\u2019re putting numbers that work into your models and ones that we\u2019re not going to let you down on and then you can make decisions accordingly. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to ask about the TMT contract renewal. Did you ultimately sign the contract or if not, was \u2013 did the customer go to a competitor or go in-house, if you did resign, was it on worse terms or was this all just a timing thing, and do you have any other large contracts coming up for renewal this year? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Right. So, every \u2013 all our divisions have large contracts every single quarter ranging from 100,000, which is small to millions which get larger and even $10 million, $20 million renewals. So, we\u2019re dealing with large contract renewals in every one of our divisions. And this particular contract renewal wouldn\u2019t even show up on a dial in any of the other three divisions. It just happens that CMS has three components and it\u2019s a bit more transparent and we wanted to give you a highlight to that. What I\u2019ll talk about in general is sometimes we have customers that \u2013 two customers can come together and form one customer. And when that happens \u2013 and that happens across financial markets, across asset management, automotive suppliers, energy companies. Our entire marketplace is filled with M&A activity that is never a smile for us. We don\u2019t get smiles when there is mergers because it means that we\u2019ll absorb in our 10% non-renewing recurring revenue every year. We\u2019ve got to work hard to rebuild that.","And so we haven\u2019t lost the contract to any competitor. We have a contract delay, which may or may not come through, couldn\u2019t tell you, but the team has done a great job to position us well if it does get renewed. And it\u2019s now in our \u2013 it\u2019s been given to you, it\u2019s in the numbers, and there is nothing else unusual about anything in the firm that is worth pointing out. And it\u2019s a good question, Toni, but there is nothing unusual here except that it\u2019s in a division and a business where it is transparent. What I can say to you in TMT is that, our RootMetrics team has \u2013 ever since that acquisition some years back, it always had a handful of big customers.","So, it always had these single points of failure, which \u2013 what I really like about the team is, we\u2019ve started to diversify and grow in doing technology benchmarking across cloud services, Internet of Things, where we\u2019re looking at the benchmarking of sensors or we\u2019re looking at the cloud service providers. We really have diversified our benchmarking activities. And benchmarking is a great business and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that without the team in Seattle that are \u2013 they are all PhDs, super-smart quants doing a great job, but they\u2019ve got some big customers that may decide to be together and therefore that has a in-quarter impact. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next quest comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Just one quick one, you had mentioned the potential impact of the government shutdown on the Ipreo business in terms of equity slowdown, was there any other impact in any other businesses, I think last quarter you talked about you might see some impact in your product design area?","Lance Uggla","Yes. I said last quarter that U.S. government and in-product design there was a continuing resolution process. And then once the government was funded, those contracts would be basically fully funded and released into revenue. And so we \u2013 that is occurring and we don\u2019t have concern about any government contracts from product design. I think that\u2019s our last question. So thank you everybody and I will turn it over to Eric.","Eric Boyer","Yes. We thank you for your interest on IHS Markit.

[Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. ","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Eric Boyer","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q4 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes that non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. ","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. ","This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website. ","After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q4 Earnings Call. Before I start, I want to say Happy New Year and also to thank Jerre for joining us today for what will be our final earnings call together. We've had a lot of fun together with the team and have set IHS upmarket for an excellent 2018. Now 2017 was a successful year for IHS Markit as we completed our first fiscal year as a merged company and delivered financial results at the upper end of our guidance. Overall, organic revenue growth was 4% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 250 basis points. Year-over-year, we grew adjusted EPS by 15%. Q4 outperformed our expectations, and within the quarter, we continued to invest for future growth in 2018 and beyond. ","Financial highlights of the quarter are, revenue of $945 million, up 6% year-over-year on an organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $366 million; and margin of 38.7%. Margin expansion was 60 basis points excluding the autoMastermind acquisition; and finally, adjusted EPS of $0.52, up 8% over the prior year. In terms of core industry verticals, I'll provide some Q4 highlights and forward-looking commentary. First, our Transportation segment continues to produce very strong results, with organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter. Growth was driven once again by strength within our auto business. Going forward, we expect high single-digit organic growth over the next several years, anchored by a diversified set of growth drivers across the segment. ","I'll mention a few here. First, our auto business, which is well diversified between our used and new car-focused offerings, is expected to continue to perform well due to the many of the same growth drivers we have spoken to in the past. These include our vehicle history report and used car listing services, supply chain forecasting, vehicle emissions analytics, digital marketing and recall services. Second, our recent acquisition of autoMastermind, which is off to a good start, will be a strong growth driver for us within the new auto dealer space. ","And finally, third, both the maritime & trade and aerospace and defense businesses are poised to benefit from improving market dynamics. In Financial Services, we produced our best quarterly result in several years, with 8% organic growth, with strength across our information, solutions and processing businesses. In particular, we had a strong quarter within our pricing, indices, valuation services, managed loan services and enterprise data management businesses. We also continue to see growth in our loan processing business. We continue to target a 4% to 6% organic growth rate over the long term. ","In Resources, we were pleased to see that our organic growth turned positive as our upstream energy business continued to improve and our mid and downstream businesses remained strong. We are confident in our low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for 2018, and we expect to have an annual contract value that improves throughout the year. We're expecting an increased -- increasing CapEx spend environment for our customers as we forecast the price of oil to average in the low 60s in 2018. CMS organic revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, and we expect to continue to deliver low single-digit growth in 2018, normalized for the boiler code. ","Moving on to our synergies and strategic initiatives. We have made substantial progress with our cost synergy program and will surpass our initial $125 million target this year. We plan to incrementally invest additional synergies in 4 strategic areas that we laid out at our April Investor Day. First, with regards to people, we are expanding training and development, investing in remote intelligence and providing a more streamlined management structure. ","Second, we have increased our investment in technology around data sites and analytics to improve both cost efficiencies as well as accelerate product development. We have also invested in internal systems to improve Workday -- workplace productivity, which are all now coming online. Third, we have leveraged our data science team to support incremental product investments and new initiatives. As previously discussed, we have now launched 20 POCs, and a number of these are now being commercialized. And finally, fourth, we are investing to increase our customer engagement by expanding our global account management structure across our corporate account base and implementing Salesforce.com. ","Moving on to revenue synergies. In 2017, we surpassed our $10 million target, and we're off to a good start in achieving a $35 million run rate for 2018. Our revenue and cost synergies are accounted for within our 2018 guidance. ","Finally, we announced the appointment of Nicoletta Giadrossi and the Lord Browne of Madingley as new directors of the company. Both have extensive experience within our end markets. ","So to close, we achieved a lot in our first fiscal year as IHS Markit, and we are focused on delivering to our forward commitments to create value for our shareholders, including consistently delivering organic revenue growth in the 4% to 6% range, at least 100 basis points of annual adjusted EBITDA margin expansion as we move to our mid-40s margin target and double-digit earnings growth. Within this framework, we'll invest for growth, return capital to shareholders and manage the business with strong corporate governance. This is our commitment to you, our shareholders. ","And I'll now turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that while our Q4 and full year 2017 results include IHS end market, prior year reported results include legacy IHS for the full year and legacy Markit from July 12 through November 30. We have included Markit's year-over-year organic revenue growth and FX revenue impact in our revenue growth rates and have included the remainder of Markit revenue as acquisitive revenue growth. ","Now for the Q4 results. Revenue was $945 million, an increase of 8% and organic revenue growth of 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $366 million, an increase of 8%, with margin of 38.7%, up 60 basis points normalized for the autoMastermind acquisition. And adjusted EPS was $0.52, an increase of $0.04 or 8%. Relative to revenue, we were pleased with the strength of Q4 revenue performance and the improving revenue trends throughout the year. ","Looking at segment performance. Transportation growth was 14%, which included 9% organic, 4% acquisitive and 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 11% recurring growth and 4% nonrecurring growth. We continue to see very strong growth in our automotive business and remain confident in our ability to drive high single-digit organic growth in our Transportation segment, led by the growth drivers that Lance discussed earlier. ","Moving on to Resources. Revenue increased 1%, including 1% organic and 1% FX. The organic revenue increase was comprised of minus 1% recurring and 10% nonrecurring. We essentially closed the year with flat Resources ACV, with Q4 growth of $8 million and full year ACV of negative $2 million. Our year-end ACV excluding OPIS is $630 million. When we report Q1, we intend to include OPIS in our ACV total and expect low to mid-single-digit growth on a like-for-like basis with improving performance throughout the year. We also closed the year with strong nonrecurring Resources revenue performance and expect mid-single-digit growth in 2018 in our nonrecurring business. ","CMS revenue growth was 5%, which included 3% organic, 1% acquisitive and 1% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of 1% recurring growth and 13% nonrecurring, which benefited from Goldfire software sales and BPVC revenue of $2 million. We expect CMS to deliver low single-digit organic growth in 2018, normalized for BPVC. ","Financial Services revenue growth was 10%, including organic revenue of 8% and 2% FX. Information organic growth was 10% due in part to favorable comparison versus prior year and some revenue catch-up from Q3. Our indices business delivered double-digit organic revenue growth as ETF AUMs remain robust, and our index administration business performed well. In addition, our bond pricing business completed some major wins. ","Our processing business delivered 4% organic revenue growth, driven largely by the loans processing business as the leveraged finance and syndicated loans markets were strong. Derivatives processing was flat due to higher rate volumes, offset by lower credit volumes. We expect our processing business to be down year-over-year in the low to mid-single-digit range due to a difficult comparison. ","Solutions revenue increased by 9% and benefited from broad-based growth across the portfolio, led by our loan services and EDM businesses. We expect our solutions business to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth in 2018. Overall, we expect to deliver within our longer-term 4% to 6% organic growth range in Financial Services for 2018. ","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $366 million, up 8% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.7%, up 60 basis points, normalized for the Mastermind acquisition. ","Regarding segment profitability, Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $111 million, with a margin of 41.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.4% excluding Mastermind, an increase of 60 basis points. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $92 million, with a margin of 42.6%, down 70 basis points versus last year. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $33 million, with a margin of 23.4%, down 360 basis points versus last year due in part to lower-margin BPVC sales in the quarter and royalty timing. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $148 million, with a margin of 46%, up 310 basis points versus last year due to flow-through from strong revenue performance. ","Adjusted EPS was $0.52 per diluted share, a $0.04 or 8% improvement over the prior year. Q4 free cash flow was $175 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $701 million and represented a conversion rate of 50%. Cash flow for the year was negatively impacted by restructuring and acquisition-related costs of approximately $113 million. Excluding these costs, conversion would have been approximately 59%. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Our year-end debt balance was $4.2 billion, which represented gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.9x on a bank covenant basis, and we closed the quarter with $134 million of cash. At quarter close, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $964 million. ","In early December, we completed a $500 million debt offering due March 2026 with an effective interest rate of 4%. Subsequent to this debt offering, our capital structure is 62% fixed, and we are targeting a minimum level of 2\/3 fixed debt at year-end. ","Our Q4 diluted weighted average share count was 412.9 million shares, and our full year diluted weighted average share count was 416.2 million shares. Our full year share repurchases were approximately $1.4 billion or 34.6 million shares, an average price of $40.71. The share repurchases included $1.1 billion against our buyback commitment and $300 million from stock option proceeds. We are planning to execute $1.1 billion of share buybacks in 2018. Our 2018 share repurchases will be back-end loaded and will be executed in line with our capital policy leverage levels. ","Moving to full year financial results. Total full year revenue was $3.6 billion, which represented growth of 32%, including 4% organic, 29% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. Revenue growth for the Transportation segment was 11%, which included 10% organic and 2% acquisitive. Revenue for the Resources segment declined 2%, including minus 4% organic and 2% acquisitive. Revenue for the CMS segment increased 1%, including 2% organic and minus 1% FX. Excluding BPVC, organic growth was flat. Pro forma revenue growth for the full year for Financial Services was 6%, including 7% organic and minus 1% FX. Within Financial Services, pro forma organic growth was 7% for information, 8% for solutions and 6% for processing. ","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.39 billion, up 41% versus a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.6% with reported margin expansion of 250 basis points. Taking account of full year 2017 Markit results, pro forma margin expansion was 130 basis points. And adjusted EPS was $2.07 per diluted share, an increase of $0.27 or 15%. ","Relative to acquisitions, autoMastermind continues to perform very well, and we expect it to achieve its January 2018 earn-out target, increasing the initial purchase price of 78% of the business from $390 million to $435 million. We also expect to record approximately $200 million to $225 million of Mastermind acquisition-related performance compensation over the next five years, which represents the estimated cost of the acquisition of the 22% of the business, which is currently owned by Mastermind founders and employees. This will be a noncash cost at the time it is initially recorded but will ultimately be settled in cash when we acquire the remaining ownership interests in 2019 through 2022. These costs are separately reported in our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. ","In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our 2018 guidance, which we provided on our November 14 guidance call, but we are revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance upward to reflect a higher revenue entry point and a lower expected effective adjusted tax rate from the new U.S. tax law. This guidance provides for, revenue of $3.8 billion to $3.85 billion, with organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%; adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.525 billion. This represents margin of 39.6% at the midpoint and approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion. In order to achieve the 100 basis points of margin expansion, the core business is expected to produce more than 200 basis points of expansion from revenue growth and cost synergies, offset somewhat by margin dilution from the Mastermind acquisition and incremental investment activity. ","We expect adjusted EPS of $2.23 to $2.27. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 9% at the midpoint. In terms of cash flow, our 2018 cash conversion is expected to improve in line with our long-term mid-60s target as merger-related restructuring costs and capital spending begin to moderate and working capital improves. This guidance includes a revised adjusted tax rate of 18% to 20% from the new U.S. tax law, which is an improvement of 2 percentage points versus our previous guidance. We expect a negative GAAP tax rate due to the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax liability at the new 21% rate, offset somewhat by our repatriation tax liability. We will record both of these items in Q1 and plan to exclude these from our adjusted tax rate. Neither of these items will impact cash in 2018. ","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Todd. We had a great finish to 2017, and I could not be prouder of the work that our teams have done over the past year on behalf of our customers and shareholders. Q4 performance has been stellar and puts us in good position as we enter 2018. ","Now before we start our Q&A, I wanted to once again thank Jerre for his partnership and shared vision in creating what really is a global information powerhouse. Together, we met, we thought and, most importantly, we executed what has truly been an exceptional combination. Jerre and I have developed an unparalleled friendship, and I'll miss his presence. ","Jerre, the floor is yours to say a few words.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Lance. I want to thank all of our colleagues of IHS Markit for providing me the highlight of my 38-year CEO career in leading such great people who've done such great things. We were able to continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders during all the change around us. It's a testament to all of our colleagues' focus and discipline. ","I also want to thank the investment community for your support. It's been a great pleasure working with you over the many, many years to create value for our investors. Finally, I want to thank Lance for his partnership and, most importantly, his friendship. Lance, you are going to lead IHS Markit to ever greater things in the years to come. ","Thank you also very much.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Jerre. Operator, we are ready to open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.","Peter Appert","And Jerre, congrats on your retirement. Thanks for the great run over the last 12 years. The organic revenue growth has been 5% to 6% over each of the last three quarters, the guidance calling for 4% to 5% in '18. So I'm just wondering, after the strong momentum you've seen in recent quarters, why the more -- slightly more conservative view going into the new year?","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Peter. It's Lance. And thanks -- I share your kind words for Jerre as well, and we really truly have had a great year together. I guess one of the things that -- I think when Jerre and I put these 2 companies together, his first advice to me was -- is let's take a real conservative approach and hit every number possible. And so we started off with 0% to 2%, and I think we ticked that box quite well. We gave a whole bunch more guidance moving into the 2% to 4% range. And we've now successfully moved from 2% to 4% and start looking forward at our 4% to 6% long-term range we gave you, which we felt, with investments and with our concerted effort to focus on organic growth, that was an objective that we could consistently hit over the coming years. And I guess the word is consistent. We need to consistently hit that over the coming years. Our move into next year, we've set 4% to 5% as our initial entry point, which is the right step to our long-term 4% to 6%, and we're confident of delivering on those goals. So consistency, hitting the numbers and making sure we do what we say we do.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC.","Gary Bisbee","I'll echo the congratulations to Jerre. I guess a two-part question here on investment and margins. So we've had two quarters in a row with a bit less margin expansion than what you've delivered and a bit less in this last quarter than we -- you've guided for going forward. Anything in particular you'd call out on that? And as part of that, Lance, can we just get an update on all of the investment that you've talked about at the Investor Day in analytics and some of the other things you've been focused on? Is -- you said earlier there were some products -- new products in commercialization at this point. Is -- should we think that this is more a long-term effort? Or are there going to be some quick wins from some of the stuff you've been doing?","Lance Uggla","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. I think I'll start, and then I'm going to pass that one to Todd. So first off, I think we're very committed and are confident in the 100 basis points. So that's a fact. Second, and I'll let Todd dig into the first part, we've had a -- some FX impact. And investments are starting to take place, and those had impact within the quarter. Some of the investments, to answer your question before I pass to Todd, are -- have been numerous. So have some 20 POCs, several moving towards commercialization. We expanded valuation component to our Vantage software product for doing portfolio analytics around energy assets. We've developed a new carbon pathway model with optimization engine that's rolling back into our product teams. We've created a next-generation event engine around our aerospace and defense and ECR using natural language processing out of our Belarus team in Minsk. That's also moving back.","Commodities, sea for oil, taking our maritime & trade and energy products together to create new trade dynamics for commodities at sea. We're about to launch a new Baltic Supramax in this index with our index and energy teams -- maritime teams, sorry, working together and working to transform some of our forecasting techniques in and around our ECR business. So those are some of the ones that we're active in. I'm personally involved. Yaacov is leading through our data science and analytics team. And those are investments we're making to drive us towards the upper end of our 4% to 6%, and we'll continue to make those investments for both short-, mid- and long-term wins. Todd, do you want to take the second?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I'll take the margin. And it's probably helpful just to step back a little bit. When we look at revenue and the revenue progression, to Peter's earlier question, I think if you look at normalized revenue for the year, you'll see that the four quarters are 2%, 3%, 4%, 6%, so good progression through the year. And we are happy with how we performed, but I think when we look to next year, the guidance range that we've established, we certainly are confident we can deliver to that. But we do have to be aware that you have processing, has been a net positive, and we -- as I said, that's going to go a bit in the other direction. I think the other thing to just be aware of, and I've talked about this in the past, is with Resources, you have to differentiate between sales growth and reported growth. So the deferred revenue model, we do expect to see improving Resources through the year. We expect to get that into a mid-single-digit growth level, but as it comes through the P&L, think of that more in the low single digits.","So I think just a couple of comments on the revenue. When we look at the margin progression, we're satisfied with the margin delivery over the last several quarters. As Lance said, we have done some level of investment to position ourselves as we go into 2018, and FX has been an impact in the numbers. And I think a couple of things I would call out there. One, we talked about this on the last call, but if we look at the other expense income line, a big piece of that is mark to market, where we have nonfunctional currency exposures that get marked, and as we've seen the dollar weaken, we have taken some losses in that line. We don't expect that to continue. We have a path to more fully hedge that exposure, so we expect to see pretty significant improvement in this other expense income, which you see has been a net negative for the year.","The other thing I would say in terms of the translation of FX is that we saw FX turn positive this quarter from a revenue standpoint, so we picked up $10 million more of revenue. We also picked up $10 million more of expense. As I've said in the past, we're relatively naturally hedged from a translation standpoint. So as we look, we did deliver $40 million more, sequentially, of revenue in the quarter. $10 million of that was Mastermind. You have about $10 million from FX, and $16 million of that, sequentially, fell through to adjusted EBITDA. So I think good performance in the margin. Importantly we are positioned, as we go into 2018, to deliver to the commitments that we've made. And yes, I think we feel good about the guidance that we've laid out.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.","William Warmington","So a question for you on the energy contract value. You talked about it finishing up the year about $630 million. The momentum there is -- has turned and is improving. The question I've been getting is whether -- if you look back to where that was back in 2014, before the price of oil started to pull back, is there anything that's happened structurally -- well, first is, if you could give us a sense for what the annual contract value was for that business on an apples-to-apples basis going back to that point and whether there's anything that's changed structurally in the business that would keep you from getting back to those previous levels.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. Bill, the annual contract value, when we entered the downturn, the first year, it declined by 5%. Last year, it declined by 10%. And coming into 2017, we said it was going to be flat and was going to be down a bit in the first part of the year. Jerre and I talked about that on the -- we said Q1 would be down. We had a handful of deals in Asia. And what we saw was exactly what we had laid out, and we were pleased to see $8 million of growth in Q4. And we ended the year down $2 million in the $630 million, which doesn't include OPIS. So going forward, we'll put OPIS in to the number. We didn't want to put it in this quarter because we want it to be apples-to-apples comparison so you would understand the performance. So we were looking at an ACV with OPIS putting another $95 million to $100 million into that number, so call it $730 million. The big thing that we talked about during the downturn were companies that were making strategic changes to their operational activities.","We lost customers at the long tail of the business in the U.S., but it was more about customers exiting geographies, talked about independent companies in the U.S. exiting some of their international operations. As we look at the market now and we see activity levels increasing, we see capital coming back, we do believe that there will be some level of opportunity in the NOCs. I mean NOCs really shut things down. We see opportunities from the Middle East. In Latin, we see opportunities offshore. So we do think it's a more active market, but we're not going to sit and predict that we're going to be back to where we were in the next couple of years. But we do see a much more stable environment and an ability to deliver to the mid-single-digit sales growth level in 2018.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh of Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","Lance, with oil ticking up kind of in the low 60s, any sense of the sensitivity of kind of the organic growth in that energy business just given when the guidance was set, it was obviously in kind of mid-40s? Any thoughts as to how that would impact kind of upstream versus downstream and in the context of the organic growth overall?","Lance Uggla","Yes. Well, we said, last quarter, our business is 65-35 in terms of upstream, 65%; and mid and downstream, 35%. Mid and downstream continued throughout the year to have a solid performance. Chemicals, OPIS, to be called out there, and we don't see that changing at all as we look forward into '18. Upstream, as we called out this time, it's about CapEx and spending. We said we are in the low to mid-60s; currently, upper mid-60s. We see some additional CapEx, and that's what will drive organic growth, and we're confident of a low single-digit growth, following on from what Todd just said a moment ago.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","A question. As we look at the Transportation business, which continues to be very strong, and auto in particular, and then digging in a little bit on automotiveMastermind, can you talk about the competitive environment and what you see as aM-specific competitive advantages that you expect to sustain sort of above-segment-average organic revenue growth going forward?","Lance Uggla","Okay. So we mentioned on the call, what we love about the automotive business across IHS Markit is its diversification across many aspects of both used and new car sales and then diversified across forecasting, recall, emission analytics, vehicle history reporting, used car sales of CARFAX, CARPROOF and now autoMastermind adding to that diversification. So a very solid diversification of assets and -- that's collectively performing to the high single digit, and we fully expect to remain there for several years to come. autoMastermind has both -- it has a leading product on the dealer floor, and so we like the growth parameters and the size and scope of their current penetration and what we see as optimal penetration over the years forward, so a leading product with a scope in their current marketplace. When we couple autoMastermind with rest of our automotive business, we also have an opportunity for new product development in and around conquest.","So currently, autoMastermind is focused on retaining the dealer customer. Together within our franchise, the new revenue opportunity is to actually help the dealers use their incentive spends and advertising spends and take new business into the franchise. So again, we feel the dynamics are right. With more challenging markets coming ahead for new car sales, dealers need these analytics. They need the data science and the tools on the floor to maintain and grow their revenues.","Operator","And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","I wanted to focus a little bit on the Financial Services side and maybe, even more specifically, the information and processing piece. You obviously had a pretty strong year in both cases. It sounds like some of it was comps, and maybe some of that reverses next year. But going into next year, what are the pluses and minuses that you guys are keeping track of? And maybe my question is more focusing on how we should think of your positioning in the MiFID world. And then maybe on processing, is there other regulations around electronification and so forth that is in the horizon? And maybe some of you work on blockchain testing and so forth, just curious how you guys are thinking of those anecdotally.","Lance Uggla","Okay. I got to keep Jerre's discipline to one question. Clearly, I'm going to have to choose one from there. But the, I guess, new kid in town, you're going to be testing me. But why don't I start with part of that. And then I'm going to pass it to Todd, and he can add from a financial perspective. First of all, I think when you look at financial information and you look at market, one of the things we really like in bringing our companies together is the diversification of taking the energy and resources, consolidated markets products into financial markets, and that's a big part of the marriage and performance of IHS Markit. So that's a good thing for our company. If you take historically the financial markets business, we always talk 5% to 7% overall. We're now running some 8 years, and really that number was 4% to 9% and so we had twice just below 5%, 3 times within 5% to 7% and now, once again, about 5% to 7%. ","I've said before, we're not bragging when we're above, we're not upset if we're slightly below. We feel a very solid, diversified performance across financial markets, which we expect to maintain going forward. And once again, today, we said if you take the pure information part of that, even though we outperformed on the upside, we want you to have in your models that 4% to 6%, which we feel is a very, very good way of looking at the combination of our mature products that have some price -- they're market-leading products with price to be used within them, so that keeps you at low single-digit growth. We've got products that we've invested in that are growing, indices, evaluated pricing, valuations, where we have strong performance, growth characteristics and upper single-digit growth. And then we have the new investment products, some of the solutions, et cetera, that have high to -- double-digit growth or no growth at all because we're just starting to invest and grow out those initiatives. So we have a nice, diversified financial markets footprint, where we feel the growth that we can deliver is consistent and margins improving, and we can continue to maintain that going forward. Do you want to add, Todd, some to that?","Todd Hyatt","The only thing I would add -- I mean, because I think that it is a good diversified portfolio, the only thing I would add is, Manav, in the supplemental materials, we provide the reporting and the growth by the information processing solutions, legacy segments. We had a good year in processing. I would say it raised the numbers by 1 point and next year, as we talked about, likely going to be a low single-digit decline versus a mid-single-digit grower this year, probably likely to take the overall portfolio growth down 1 point, right? So that's the thing I would be aware of. But when we look at the core of the portfolio and we look at this information solutions, those product sets continue to perform very well, and we're pretty -- feel pretty good as we enter next year about the future that we have there.","Lance Uggla","Great. Thanks, Todd. I will close on -- MiFID, just to close on that point, is a positive for us in terms of a tailwind. It's the implementation of solutions to solve regulatory problems, which has been growth for us this year, and with continued implementation, we feel well positioned from a positive perspective going into '18.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Todd, I want to get back into oil and gas CapEx and ACV. Oil and gas CapEx has already had a massive rebound in 2017 and poised to grow double-digit in 2018. Why are Resources ACV kind of only poised to be up mid-single digit in that environment? Is it the NOC geographies being held back? Are there any other kind of constraints for ACV to be up more like CapEx?","Todd Hyatt","Well, I mean, I think we look at it by different market and different segment, and so I called out areas that we see as being net-net growers next year and opportunities. And we certainly -- entering the first half of the year and looking at the market, it's an improved market, but I think there are still companies that are a bit cautious about substantial investment levels. So when you talk about the significant rebound in capital, I mean, we do see CapEx being up year-over-year, but we're talking about being up high single digit, low double digit. I mean we're not talking about being up 50%, 75%. I think companies are still going to be careful in terms of their cost structure and their investment levels. So the market feels -- don't get me wrong, the market feels a lot better to us. And just like we were confident coming into 2017 that we could move the ACV to a flat level, we feel good about the ability to grow ACV. But I think from our perspective, it's too early to call a high single-digit grower at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anj Singh of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","On CMS, I know there's a lot of opportunity to improve the performance of that segment, and you're guiding to growth in '18 that's basically in line with your longer-term view. But how should we be thinking about the margin performance in '18 there? Anything you'd call out with regard to drivers of margin improvement in that business that you're excited about?","Lance Uggla","Right. I think there's two pieces to that. I'm just going to talk about the business performance and the teams leading that, and then I'll hand it to Todd on the specific margin question. So Jonathan Gear has worked hard to put in place a very strong leadership around both product design and our parts business, which is led by Chad Hawkinson and his team. And we've -- Ian Weightman, he's taking full responsibility for our technology businesses, which includes the tech and RootMetrics. We feel the dynamics, first of all, in product design. Workbench 2.0 was fully implemented this year, 100% client takeup, and it gives us a great opportunity as we'll release Workbench 3.0 this year to continue to expand services to grow existing revenue, albeit not at the highest margin in this business, but a good, strong improving position for us. So we're pleased about that.","And then technology, our view is, is that we've underperformed historically in a growth market, and this is a year we start marching back towards mid-single digits and get in line with the rest of the marketplace. So I feel good about the business deep dives, the reorganization and the positioning for better growth in 2018. Todd, do you want to add something on the margin?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. The two specific things on margin, one is the -- we've talked about, in the past, the TMT product consolidation, so significant reduction in the number of products. We've really moved that business from a one-off report sale to larger, stickier subscription offering. So we do see that having the ability to benefit margin. And then the other, which Lance talked about, the Engineering Workbench. It is about providing proprietary functionality to customers, which enhance the value that we bring to the table with the specs and standards customers. And I do think that provides ability to upsell and drive margin.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Todd, I think this one is for you, on the revenue guidance. You made this comment, I think, in your prepared remarks that you exited the year at a higher rate and that, therefore -- or higher base and, therefore, you're bringing up the guidance. If I look at my numbers and, in particular, FX, I think you had $10 million in FX included in your guidance before. If my math is right, I think $30 million should be -- there should be an incremental $30 million just in terms of where the pound and the euro are running. So is the guidance upside really just FX? Or is there anything else you would call out? And by the way, if it's FX, if you're using $30 million for the low end and $20 million for the high end, so why a different number? So maybe just flush out all the components, including FX.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. We don't update for FX quarter after quarter after quarter. I mean, I think FX was a positive in Q4. We'll see where rates land, but really, the guidance update on revenue really recognize the over-performance on the organic level in Q4 flowing through to 2018. And as we go through the year, we'll call out FX commentary and update accordingly, but at this point, we haven't wend in and changed all the numbers for exchange. We will monitor it as we go through the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","Let me help Manav, cleaning up for what I think was part D of his question. Just, Lance, you were talking about blockchain several years ago, before, I guess, it was cool. So I guess, any update on where are you? Is it still proof of concept? Is it commercialized at this point for you? And just how big of an opportunity can it be?","Lance Uggla","Right. Well, I think blockchain is an important new technology, a distributed ledger technology and, in general, has been an important advance in terms of ownership changes of assets. And so we process derivatives, we process loans, FX, and therefore, our teams need to be well informed and active users of all new technologies. And so under Adam Kansler and Brad Levy, in our processing businesses, we've executed with industry several proof of concepts. We have our proof of concept in and around our loan processing called Stacks, recently called out in a few -- Seeking Alpha picked up on that a week or so ago. And we have a great team that has leveraged the technology to position us well. If and so the market participants see a desired shift to those new technologies and can afford the implementation costs of those new technologies and improve the ownership transference of assets, then IHS Markit is well positioned to participate and share in the upsides of those changes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Silber","Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question about a little bit more granularily -- granularity, excuse me, in the revenue guidance for this year. Was there any specific segment that maybe caused you to increase your guidance? And then also, why didn't the adjusted EBITDA guidance change? Are you just being conservative?","Todd Hyatt","When we look across, I would say nothing specific at the segment level. The color is materially the same color that we provided in November. As we look at ensuring that we're investing at an appropriate level to continue to grow the business, we look at delivery of margin to the bottom line. We think that this is the right balance, and we think it's the right balance that allows us to manage the business effectively, not only for 2018 but into the future. So that was ultimately a call that Lance and I made relative to the margin, and we think that what we've guided to is a robust level of margin and certainly an acceptable level to be at.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Lance, you had indicated $35 million of run-rate revenue synergy expectations in 2018. Can you provide an update on the progress of your cross-selling initiatives, including how your pipeline and close rates are progressing as well as your latest revenue synergy expectations for fiscal 2019?","Lance Uggla","Right. Okay. Thanks, George. So when we started out -- I guess we put a few numbers out at the time of the merger. One of the key numbers for 2017 was to achieve $10 million and the $10 million to achieve within year. We actually ended the year at a $12 million run rate, so I think the team did a great job. Probably a little bit slower start than at the merger, but what was very nice to see was the buildup of the pipeline, the opportunity sets and the pace -- the growing pace every single quarter of actual revenue closes. So no quarter had been less than the previous quarter. So I think the dynamics around the revenue synergies were very good, and the momentum is excellent. We also reaffirmed that we felt -- the $100 million exit at the end of 2019 run rate, we've emphasized several times that, that is a good number, and we continue to work towards it. So that brings about 2018, which we originally had said that we would be about $35 million in revenue synergies for 2018. And today, I said that we felt $35 million run rate exiting '18 is a good number and the pace of the pipeline and the closing of the current opportunities supports that very well. And I have to say it's been one of the most pleasing parts of our merger, is that we executed on the cost side but we're getting the revenue flow-through and the revenue opportunities. We've set up the new account management structure. It took us a little bit longer. Everything takes longer than what you think, but we now have that in place. Mark Rose is leading our global account management strategy across corporates. And it's really been the financial markets account managers that have been driving the hundreds of now pipeline opportunities, and hundreds is number of opportunities, of pipeline opportunities from financial markets. But equally, we've been growing the corporate side. And with the newly invested account management team across large corporates, we feel that we're poised to deliver the $35 million exit run rate this year, and we're on track for the $100 million run rate at the end of '19.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Michael Reid","This is Mike Reid on for Joe. So with the cost synergies tied up already, is there any upside to that $125 million? And if so, how much? And where do you think that would come from?","Lance Uggla","What we said today is that we have the $125 million in hand and had exceeded it and that we'll continue to take remaining cost synergies from the merger, consolidation of remaining offices, et cetera. And so we have some more, and we're also going to use the cost synergies to continue to invest in our initiatives to drive short-, mid- and long-term revenue growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America.","David Ridley-Lane","Sure. Based on the already signed MiFID-related contracts you have, what's the expected revenue contribution from those products and solutions in fiscal '18? And then are you still signing contracts today? Or have those bookings really slowed already?","Lance Uggla","No. Well, actually, the marketplace was given a few extra months to get fully in place with these new regulations, and we see 2018 as to be additive to our revenue within our information group. The team has done a good job, and we put ourselves in a good position in and around MiFID II regulations. We've got GDPR regulation in terms of implementation this year, where we have product offerings. We don't break out and disclose the individual revenue in and around MiFID, but it is a positive for our business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I want to also add my congratulations to Jerre on his retirement. And Lance, just wanted to tell you better change the locks because he has a way of keeping on coming back.","Lance Uggla","We'll welcome that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I want to focus a little bit more on just automotiveMastermind. It seems like, one quarter out of the box, you're already showing the incremental expenses for, frankly, outperformance on the payments. Can you talk about what the outperformance was on the revenue? Just give us like the dollar in the quarter and what you're seeing. And then also, it seems like there's a drag from the EBITDA of about $5.5 million -- $5.7 million. And when does -- when do you expect that to start to be a contributor to EBITDA overall?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. The original agreement provided for a holdback that was tied to December revenue, January dealer count, and the business performed well. And so our estimate is that the business will deliver to that earn-out. That was always part of the original agreement. And basically, I think, in a high growth business like this, as we look at the plan and as we were negotiating the agreement, we agreed an amount, but then there was a holdback tied to the delivery of the performance. I don't know where the -- you're getting the $5 million. I mean, basically, what we said was AMM is a slight negative adjusted EBITDA when we acquired the business. Think of that in terms of single-digit percent. And the business delivered $10 million of revenue in October, November in the acquisitive revenue. So there's a negative $1 million of EBITDA rolling through. For next year, we've talked about a revenue target of $80 million and a low single-digit adjusted EBITDA percent, and then we see that moving into the 20% -- mid-20s as we go into 2019.","Operator","And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","My question is on tax reform. I was hoping you could touch on any impact from tax reform on the cash side. I know you talked about the book impact. And then also linked to that, any early conversations with your customers whether tax savings could lead to an uptick in spending with you as you look across your various verticals?","Todd Hyatt","Well, from a cash perspective, there are really going to be several things. One is a lower ETR will flow through to tax -- or to cash. So we said our ETR is going to benefit by 2% from an adjusted perspective. The other cash impact will be the repatriation tax, which we'll report at the end of Q1. It's payable over eight years. We see that as being a -- not a significant negative cash impact in 2019 to make the first payment. And then sort of the theoretical impact is the deferred tax liability and the revaluation of that, but that will be well into future years, where we would see a benefit on that versus prior tax.","Lance Uggla","Good. Thanks, Todd. And on the customer side, of course, as we read in the press, there's groups of corporates and financial institutions, some winners, some losers depending on how they are headquartered and how they're situated today. And in general, I think we would say that there'll be some positive outcomes for many of our customers, and we'll look to take that positive environment to be positive tailwinds for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","I was hoping that, Lance, you could elaborate just a little bit further on 10% organic info growth. You mentioned the strength in ETFs and bond pricing. I think of indices as sort of pretty recurring just given that like when the net asset value is up, it doesn't reset. And bond pricing, I'm not totally sure if you look at it more transactional or recurring. But I'm just trying to think of why info wouldn't be higher than the typical 4% to 6% in 2018.","Lance Uggla","Yes. Thanks, Toni. So I guess it's the mantra that we've taken with the information services group since the original -- the premerger company right through the divisional performance within IHS Markit. And we've looked at ourselves as having a very defensible, diversified set of information processing and solutions that can drive 5% to 7%. And as I said, eight years running, that number has really kind of been 4% to 9%. So I think the stability in the delivery of that 4% to 9% is very well supported and supported historically, and we confirm that we feel that's a good way to look at us going forward. So why do we have that when you have such a strong quarter? And of course, sometimes, all parts add up and deliver to a positive outcome, and Q4 was one of those outcomes. And -- but we still -- the underlying businesses, we have some really, really great products, great products that are well matured in their marketplaces. So your main growth with those products comes from price.","You've got a market-leading product, people want the product, there isn't substantive new market entrants to pick up the product, and therefore, your growth in that is price. And price is low single digits that's applied to a three-year contract, and therefore, expect on that part of our business low single-digit growth. So that's the first part. That's good news that we've got that position, bad news that, that type of position doesn't deliver you high single-digit growth. The second bit is we have great positions where we're growing the customer base, adding new products and delivering into key market momentums. Indices is a perfect example of that; bond pricing, a perfect example of that, where big addressable markets where we have a great product and the dynamics lead to high single-digit or low double-digit growth. We have then always been innovators. To -- when you think about the Financial Services, this is a company that started 2003. It's 13 years old. It generated, whatever it is now, $7 billion, $8 billion of market cap over that period of time. It's done that by being innovative, designing, developing and implementing new products and solutions for financial markets that when you launch them, of course, they only have costs, they are a drag on overall revenue growth. As they come online, they move into strong double-digit growth, and then over time, they mature. So I think we really do have a very good approach to describing that revenue to our shareholders, to managing that revenue and expense and margin expansion for the company and our shareholders. And I think that, that conservative, committed approach to that is one that holds the company in good stead, and we'll continue to do that. This is the last question, I think.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session for today.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Good. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 2019 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning we issued our Q2 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion of the quarter includes non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other items. IHS Markit believes its non-GAAP results are useful to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Please refer to our earnings release on our website for definitions of the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit's filings with the SEC and in the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance?","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call.","I was pleased with Q2 as we continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model with diversified revenue growth, good margin and profit delivery, and strong cash flow. We delivered a solid quarter in line with our expectations, continued to make progress delivering to our target leverage range allowing us to begin our $500 million buyback in Q3, and we also announced a strategic asset exchange that enhances our downstream resources business.","Some key financial highlights of the quarter are. Revenue of $1.136 billion, up 5% on an organic basis and 13% overall. Continued solid performance across our three scaled verticals; Transportation, Financial Services, and Resources. Adjusted EBITDA of $465 million and margin of 41%, up 150 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS of $0.71, up 16% over the prior year.","Let me now provide some segment highlights. Transportation continued to perform at a high level with organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter, at the top end of our high single-digit guidance. The auto business benefited in the quarter from strong performance from CARFAX's used car listing and banking and insurance businesses, Automotive Mastermind, the ongoing transition of the CARFAX Canada business to a subscription model, and our recall and forecasting businesses.","Within auto, we continue to benefit from the increasing complexity across the auto value chain and believe we are well positioned for long-term growth due to our diversification and strong new product pipeline. This includes our latest new CARFAX product launch, CARFAX for Life, which is experiencing good early market traction. We also continue to progress our auto's Unity Platform.","Unity combines our various auto forecasting databases into a single platform leveraging new technology and analytics. The Unity project is already accelerating product development in our auto forecasting business, including supporting the launch of a new autonomous vehicle forecast product. And finally, within transportation, our Aerospace and Defense and our maritime and trade businesses, both performed to expectations.","Financial Services, here we reported 5% organic growth. In particular a strong quarter for WSO, our loans portfolio management software and managed service and our digital solutions business. Ipreo results rebounded within the global capital markets business as expected, while the private capital markets business continued its strong double-digit growth performance.","The integration is ahead of plan. In resources, we delivered another solid quarter with 6% organic growth anchored by stable recurring revenue growth and strong non-recurring revenue growth. Strong performers in the quarter included downstream pricing, chemicals, and CERAWeek.","We are well positioned for the year to deliver to our mid single-digit organic revenue growth target, which is supported by stable industry trends despite recent oil price movements, the growth of our 12month - our trailing 12-month annual contract value, and strong non-recurring revenue pipeline.","We also signed definitive agreements with Informa for the exchange of the majority of our TMT market intelligence business for Informa's Agribusiness Intelligence Group. The deal increases our focus on core markets where we have particular strength and a long-term commitment to grow.","We'll be integrating the Informa agribusiness intelligence portfolio to our chemical and downstream businesses, which builds upon our existing data, pricing, insights, forecasting and new services within our resources segment. Agriculture is the largest chemical end market in the world and this transaction expands our capabilities into fertilizer and chemical crop protection while expanding our capabilities in biofuels.","Reviewing our portfolio is a continuous process across our businesses and something that we look at through the lens of what is in the best long-term interest of the Company strategically, financially for shareholders, and also for our colleagues.","Finally, CMS organic revenue growth was negative 2% as our TMT business continues to be impacted by the non-renewal of a single contract. We continue to expect CMS organic growth to be in the low single digits for the year. Product design, the largest business within CMS, continued to make progress on its cost structure.","Finally, I want to give an update on the progress we've made on our data lake strategy, which we have been working on since the merger. The data lake is designed to provide a single platform to explore and access our organization's data while reducing costs for both our customers and ourselves. Our data lake will help us discover new insights, realize new synergies and savings, and help create new commercial opportunities.","Currently, all of our underlying data is now mapped and cataloged and the data lake infrastructure is in place. We are now populating the data lake with the relevant data sets and plan to have this completed by the end of our fiscal year. Colleagues now have access to our extensive catalog and are starting to run analytics across datasets.","A lot of progress has been made to date, but we're just at the beginning in terms of starting to realize the benefits of our longer-term strategy. I look forward to providing future updates. Overall, we are pleased with another solid quarter of execution and financial results.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance.","As Lance discussed, our Q2 results were in line with our expectations and included revenue of $1.136 billion, an increase of 13% and organic growth of 5%; net income of $149 million and GAAP EPS of $0.37.","Adjusted EBITDA of $465 million, an increase of 17% with margin of 41.0%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and adjusted EPS of $0.71, an increase of $0.10 or 16%. Relative to revenue, our Q2 organic revenue growth of 5% included stable recurring fixed organic of 5%, flat recurring variable organic and non-recurring organic of 9%.","Looking at segment performance, Transportation revenue growth was 8% including organic revenue growth of 9% and negative 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 10% recurring and 6% non-recurring. Resources revenue growth was 5%, including 6% organic and negative 1% FX.","The organic revenue increase was comprised of 4% recurring and a 11% non-recurring. Our Q2 organic ACV increased $9 million and our trailing 12 month organic ACV increased $29 million to $747 million, which was up 4% versus prior year.","We continue to trend at an ACV level supportive of our 2019 revenue expectation. CMS revenue declined 3% including 2% organic decline and negative 1% FX. Organic revenue has been negatively impacted by the non-renewal of a contract in our TMT benchmarking business.","Recurring organic was flat, and non-recurring organic declined $2 million or 10%. We expect approximately $10 million of organic revenue growth in second half of the year from the Boiler Code. We continue to expect full year CMS organic growth to be in the low single digits.","Financial Services revenue growth was 29%, including organic revenue of 5%, acquisitive growth of 25% and negative 1% FX. Recurring fixed organic was 4%, recurring variable organic was flat and non-recurring organic increased $7 million with 31% organic growth. Non-recurring growth was driven by strong software sales benefiting from the new software revenue recognition standard.","Our information business organic growth was 1% due primarily to a challenging comparison versus the prior year which grew organically 11%. We remain confident in our mid-single digit organic growth for the year. We continue to see stability in our credit and loan pricing businesses and strong growth in bond pricing and valuation services.","We also expect increased growth in our index businesses supported in part by AUM growth. Processing organic declined $2 million or 3%. Derivative processing was up, but was offset by decline in our loans processing business. Solutions organic growth was 15% led primarily by software sales in our loan management business, benefiting from the new software revenue recognition standard.","We expect solutions growth to slow in Q3, due in part to negative impact from the new revenue standard. As expected, Ipreo revenue increased to $87 million in the quarter, due in part to improved equity markets. Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $465 million, up $67 million or 17% versus prior year.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.0%, up 150 basis points on a reported basis and up 115 basis points normalized for Ipreo and FX. Regarding segment profitability, Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $137 million with margin of 42.9%, up 80 basis points. Resources' adjusted EBITDA was $109 million with margin of 43.8%, up 140 basis points. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with margin of 21.8% up 30 basis points.","Financial Services' adjusted EBITDA was $206 million with margin of 47.5%, up 300 basis points normalized for Ipreo and up 110 basis points on a reported basis. Financial Services margin was driven by strong revenue flow through benefiting in part from prior year cost reductions and favorable product mix.","We expect some moderation in financial services margin in the second half due to increased investment, and increase in lower margin services revenue. Adjusted EPS was $0.71 per diluted share, a $0.10 or 16% improvement. Our GAAP tax rate was 14% and our adjusted tax rate was 18%. As expected, we delivered strong Q2 free cash flow of $358 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $1.079 billion and represented a conversion rate of 64%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our quarter-end debt balance was $5.3 billion and represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.1 times on a bank covenant basis. In Q3, we will return to our target leverage range and resume our share buyback.","In the quarter, we completed a $1 billion of public debt financing, including $600 million of ten-year bonds at a 4.25% coupon rate and $400 million of five-year bonds at a 3.625% coupon rate. We've essentially completed the terming out of our capital structure with fixed debt as a percent of total debt of 90% at quarter end. We closed the quarter with $110 million of cash and our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1 billion.","Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 409 million shares. We expect to complete a $500 million share buyback by year-end. This will have minimal impact on our 2019 weighted average diluted share count, but will reduce our year-end 2019 share count by approximately 8 million shares.","Finally, as we announced on May 22nd, we signed definitive agreements with Informa for the exchange of the majority of our TMT market intelligence business for Informa's agribusiness intelligence group. The agreement values the two exchange businesses at equivalent EBITDA multiples with Informa contributing an additional $30 million cash to IHS Markit to reflect larger EBITDA contribution from the TMT business.","As a result of the exchange, our annual CMS revenue will decline by approximately $60 million, while our annual resources revenue will increase by $40 million. The exchange is slightly dilutive to adjusted EBITDA and neutral to adjusted EPS. The agribusiness intelligence acquisition is expected to close June 30, the TMT market intelligence transaction is expected to close August 1st. In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our prior guidance.","As you think through modeling the rest of the year, it is important to note that Q2 has seasonally become our strongest quarter, and as such, we tend to see outsized operating leverage and margin flow through compared to the rest of the year.","Our full year guidance provides for revenue of $4.425 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% including Ipreo four-month stub period organic contribution. Including Ipreo for 12 months would increase total organic growth to 6% to 7%.","We also expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.75 billion to $1.78 billion, including adjusted EBITDA of $115 million from Ipreo. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 100 basis points normalized for FX and excluding Ipreo and 80 basis point margin expansion including Ipreo. Adjusted EPS of $2.52 to $2.57. And finally we expect conversion, cash conversion in line with our mid-60s target or more than $1.1 billion of free cash flow.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd.","I'm pleased with our Q2 results, which put us on track to deliver to our full year financial commitments. We continue to have solid diversified revenue growth with expanding margins and strong free cash flow. We made continued progress towards our Ipreo synergy targets and made a positive portfolio exchange that enhances our downstream resources business. Finally, during Q3, we'll be in a position to start to deliver upon our committed capital return to shareholders by repurchasing 500 million of shares in the second half.","Operator, we are ready to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","So Lance and Todd, the margin progress remains very impressive. I'm wondering if the progress you're seeing this year emboldens you perhaps to be a little more aggressive in terms of where you think margin can go. And then related to that, I'm just wondering this data lake strategy you've outlined, is that something that moves the needle in terms of margin - margins over the course of next year or two?","Lance Uggla","I guess - well, thanks Peter. And those are both good questions. So I'll start with the first one and then Todd can add and then I'll do the data lake. So on margin, I guess we have a strong conviction that mid-40%s is the correct place for IHS Markit to head to over the next periods and we've committed to 100 basis points of margin every year and I think that that's something that we've been consistent at. We pretty much hit those numbers dead-on and I think the market's gaining confidence that we can get to our mid-40%s.","And so personally, that's how we are leading the firm and managing the firm. At 5% growth, we still have to work hard to deliver 100 basis points. We get 50 - you probably get 50 basis points naturally through the revenue leverage, but then you've got to go out and find another 50 basis points or $22 million to $25 million, which means that you are having to work hard using technology, using better costed locations and strategy, and at 5% it's real work.","I think as we consistently start to perform at 6% to 7%, that's going to open up some additional margin for us. And what I'd like to see is that we start to consistently invest that incremental cash to enable us to start to consistently hit 6%s, 7%s and occasionally an 8%. And we haven't done that yet, we went from zero to 2%, 2% to 4%, 4% to 6% and I'd like us to consistently start hitting in the upper end of our revenue guidance range as we look forward and that may give us an opportunity to look at that differently.","But I'd say short-term, operating in the 5% to 6% organic growth revenue range; we will look to invest in our people, in our products, our technology, our internal platforms, and also driving some of the efficiency gains using technology also takes a bit of additional investment. So, that's it on the margins. So don't expect a lot more out of 100 in the second half, which I'm sure will be one of the favorite questions of the day. So, we'll put that one to rest.","The second thing I'd say is that we've got - on the data lake strategy, we're into three years post the merger. I'd say it's a year and a half of planning, selecting technology stack, and implementing infrastructure. Our infrastructure is fully implemented. We have set out our architecture, our indexing, and our data science and technology teams are now busy with the product teams filling the data lake. Now what we said at merger is that we thought that the data lake strategy could enable two things.","One, create some efficiencies so that's going to help us with the margin, but more importantly change our new product development life cycle so shorten it. So I would expect, going forward, opportunity to more readily hit our upper end of our revenue targets once the data lake is full and product development is occurring direct from the data lake.","I'd also say that we have opportunities with our - with more customers. So, expand to a broader range of customers because the data lake as a distribution tool becomes a lot easier for our customers to navigate our information, connect to it, and commercially buy our data in ways that we probably don't sell to them today.","And so, I'm very excited about both those things. We worked very hard, it's three years since merger and I think you're going to hear us talking more and more about that and I'd love to think that that forms part of the vitality of our new revenue sources as we look forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","My question was - I guess, broadly just the asset swap was interesting, you made some comments in the portfolio review. Maybe just talk about what else is being reviewed and just maybe just help us reiterate the capital allocation policy?","Lance Uggla","Well, I think it's in terms of a portfolio move, I think hats off to the team. It really is an exceptional exchange for both Informa and IHS Markit. Informa is building their technology business. We have market-leading world-class resources business and this perfectly fits and extends our position, number one position in chemicals, pricing and news extending that team downstream into fertilizers, added biofuels, crop protection. It's same types of customers, more information, tens of thousands of new data sets, it really is a great opportunity for us. It was sub-scale for Informa.","On the TMT side, we had three types of TMT assets. We have our benchmarking assets which do have some synergies with the other parts of the Group. We had technology assets in semiconductors, very important to our automotive franchise and we have technology assets in and around the renewable space, solar and wind, very important to our energy business and we had tech assets around battery storage, important to both automotive and energy.","So we've been able to redistribute those tech assets back into the business, maintain benchmarking as a smaller, more focused business and shed what was non-core to us which were screens, displays, video, a whole bunch of things that were not core to us but will be core to Informa.","So good for people, good for us. That's exactly what I want the team to do is to be creative around the continued cleanup of our portfolio and there are some assets, you guys know the assets as well as I do that are small or sub-scale or not exactly core within our portfolio.","And if the opportunity to make changes occurs, and the financial structure of that deal makes sense, we'll do it. And we're constantly looking at our portfolio and we will look for more of those types of things to do, that are actually win-wins and we're super excited to have the agricultural intelligence business join our downstream pricing reporting into Brian Crotty who runs the OPIS and downstream businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Gary Bisbee","On the transportation business, very strong growth, particularly against a tougher comp here, right. I guess the question I get asked most from investors around this business is just can you help me understand the penetration of some of the core offerings there within CARFAX and other parts of the business forecasting, et cetera. Can you just give us an update on that and where we are in the growth curve on some of the key assets there? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","I think Todd and I'll do this one together, but I'll start off with a few of the businesses that I personally know very well now. So take for example used car listings. We're growing strong double digits. We have the best product. We've integrated the vehicle history reporting of CARFAX into our listings product and we've created a great UX, great experience, we're growing double-digits and we've got big players with a lot of revenue in front of us.","So my view there is, we have a significant growth over the next three to five years, just stick to the knitting, continue to do what we do and do it well. Next piece of growth of course is integration of our services across IHS Markit automotive, the acquired Mastermind and CARFAX and make sure we're leveraging our capabilities across the Group, especially with respect to used car listings, as well as the overall service lane.","And making sure that we're building audiences for our customers and we're targeting ways to help our customers make revenue. And whether that we're in a tough market for sales of cars or an easy market, there is dollars being spent on marketing and expanding those sales channels and the team is doing a good job. I'd say the other thing is the automotive chain is increasingly complex.","AVs, EVs, new componentry and given the complexity, our subject matter experts providing the research into the forecasting suites of all of the OEMs is giving us an expanded growing revenue stream that is starting to outperform.","So you have to remember what we did this quarter is in each of our segments, we told you the things that outperformed in the quarter. But if you look back over the last 12 quarters, those names are changing regularly. It just shows the depth and diversity of our business and forecasting and complexity around the spaces we're in is increasing. That would be in the next piece, I'd say.","Finally, what I'd say is that, the market for new cars is slowing down and therefore any tools to help sell cars is a positive and we provide with Mastermind, CARFAX, the additional support for the dealers to sell a car, service a car and - or exchange or trade in a car or actually go after one of their competitors' cars and that's a great place for us to be.","So net-net, we continue to be high-single digits, and high single-digits again to me, are 7, 8, 9 and we happen to be at 9, we could have been at 8 could have been at 7, it really wouldn't make a difference to me, right. The teams work hard to maximize revenue every quarter, but we are confident in high-single digits and they continue to do that.","Todd, do you want to add something to that?","Todd Hyatt","I'll just give it another lens, which is you have to appreciate the market position that we have. We have a very strong position in the used car market if we're talking about CARFAX and we are an important part of the entire used car workflow across that chain, whether it's a dealer taking a car in trade-in or selling a car, servicing a car.","So we're really core in that process. And so what we've done strategically it's the one-time, the lifetime is start with the VHR business and then expand that into other revenue streams. So VHR we have evaluation product which we don't monetize, but we create value for the dealer with that product. We talked about used car listing, we're now moving into the service lane. And so to me, the innovation and the additional product creation driving additional revenue streams with the anchor position and doing that in a way that's supporting the entire value chain and demonstrating value to our customers and that to me is the theme around used cars, also, the theme in new car.","We have a strong position in production forecasting, but we've added products. We've added the VPAC, emissions analytic product. Lance talked about audience building and revenue that we drive through the underlying information we have on car ownership. So, to me it's about building additional revenue streams from our market positions and assets that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","So, a question on Ipreo. If you annualize the $87 million in revenue from Q2 comes in just under $350 million, which is in line with the low end of the $350 million to $370 million guidance, but the revenue will need to accelerate further in the second half in order to make up for the softness in Q1. So the question is how - how did the revenue progress during the quarter and what gives you confidence in the acceleration in Q3 and Q4?","Lance Uggla","Yes, well, I think Q2 the markets and Ipreo performed in line with our expectations of the acquisition and the teams did a great job and in terms of the synergies, you know, Adam, Kevin, the entire market - IHS Markit and Ipreo teams have got ahead of the synergies in terms of working through the integration.","I would expect that in Q3, Q4 we pick - you pick up incremental revenue in both the quarters above Q2 level and when you annualize that, you'll move up to the top end of the range. So, in terms of run rate, I think, I think we end up at the top end of the range.","I think in terms of actual, we will be in that range on that - you know, at the lower end of that range and that's the breaks of a tough Q1 and that's it. There is nothing else to say. The business is performing well and we continue to move on and each quarter we'll look to build on the revenue performance of the previous one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","Want to ask about the auto forecasting which is call out as a strength - as a driver of transportation for the past couple of quarters now. And I guess my questions related to is the contribution from the Unity Platform occurring or is that on the common if it's not Unity there were a couple of other call outs of new products, VPAC commissions maybe more growth from OEMs. Just help us understand what's serving the strong performance in auto forecasting and tie it to the Unity platform comments. And not totally clear to me is that a client facing platform or is that back-end of other enabling product development since launch.","Lance Uggla","Now, Unity is part of our data science, data lake strategy and it's really important that across the group, we have spent several years now since the merger and the case in auto forecasting even the year going into the merger putting our data sets and our tools into a modern tech structure that allows for accelerated product development and re-forecasting in changes what was - if you look back to the historical IHS Markit automotive forecasting business, it was probably acceptable to update a big automotive forecasting model on a quarterly basis and that was acceptable.","Today, our customers want updates almost in real time and therefore to deliver that, we can't be doing that in with spreadsheets and Oracle databases. We need to do it with a modern tech stack and that's what Unity is. Actually, Yaacov Mutnikas, our Chief Data Scientist and CTO is here, maybe you want to talk a little bit about just where we're at in terms of the data lake strategy and how that's helping businesses like our automotive forecasting team.","Yaacov Mutnikas","Briefly we - as Lance mentioned earlier, integrating all our data sets in data lake, with an unified interface to the data lake across - and an unified taxonomy across all data assets that we have and so that facilitates projects such as Unity and many others that were consistent couple of data interface with a standard taxonomy to engage, to build out new products, new analytics and deliver value to the business.","Lance Uggla","Yes. And in a much more rapid way. So great job to the team. It definitely is key to our automotive forecasting, continued revenue growth and as we look forward, all of our product sets will gain shorter development lifecycles when they're building out of our data lake infrastructure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cho with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Cho","My first question is just around ACV comments. At the - I think in the past you mentioned that you expected ACV to improve or accelerate year-over-year throughout the year. Is that still the case and can you give us some color on what you're assuming for end-market activity growth behind the ACV outlook commentary? And two, just a clarification on Ipreo, what was Ipreo's organic revenue growth in the second quarter? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","With ACV, we are growing at 4%, the number moved up a bit in absolute dollars this quarter. I think we moved up by $5 million from last quarter. So we continue to see good, stable progression in ACV. We guided to ACV that would support a mid single-digit sub-revenue growth and so that's going to be a mid-single digit level of ACV growth and we do expect to see ACV continue to improve in the back half of the year, but we're still - we're still staying with the mid-single digit guidance on the resources business. So modest level of improvement as we move through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","I just wondered if you could elaborate on WSO, which I think you called out as being particularly impactful to the growth of solutions. Just what's driving the growth there, I think would be helpful. Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Well, I think the - I've called out in terms of the acquisition of Ipreo, our business in leverage loans, and in general in alternatives, we see that whole alternative space continuing to grow low yields in the liquid and public markets driving people to reach to higher yielding private assets.","You've got more private equity players that are looking for other areas, they've had great performance. They're raising large amounts of capital and looking for new and diversified ways to invest.","So, we see many new private equity players moving into private debt. You've got traditional asset managers, rarely do I find a traditional asset manager that isn't trying to move its credit market expertise from public markets and start sneaking its way up into the private markets. And when you see that, there is one thing in common for all these people, buying the public bond fits very well into all the OMS systems that are available in the marketplace.","Buying a private bond, a leveraged loan, doesn't. And it requires - it requires tools, software, pricing, indices and WSO is the world leader for leveraged loan back office. So we bought that asset that came out of JP Morgan's Investor Services Group, some years ago which they were using for their customers. When it came into our team's hands, we both attracted other banks.","We also attracted all the hedge funds and asset managers that wanted to participate in the leverage loan space. So that's a growth area. I think anything we do around alternatives, private debt, private capital has strong growth characteristics in the markets around them and then when you start to add that in with our reporting tools that we acquired through Ipreo, our compliance tools, which we've been rolling out called deal flow, we really do have a very strong suite of products to support the - the private debt private equity markets, also the valuations.","So that's WSO is the generally the chosen platform probably nine times out of ten and our teams have done a good job getting their share of that marketplace. So we've done well there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Lance, I'm intrigued by the commentary around the longer-term organic revenue growth aspirations. Are - is a step up from 5 to say 6 or 7 in your view, mostly or entirely dependent on the data lake strategy and success and time to market and product development acceleration or there is some other drivers in addition to that, that you're looking to?","Lance Uggla","Yes, I think there is the three or four key revenue drivers, okay. So, people of course you've got to have great people and you've got to be able to keep your good people. So it's important that we have a strong financial performance and can pay our people well. So people will be first. On product, product to me is all of our product groups will be enhanced by the data lake. It's going to help them improve margins by leveraging the data ingestion of the data lake rather than doing it many times across different product suites.","So the leverage of the technology will be strong for margin which will provide for some incremental investing because my trade off with the groups is, spend the time and commit to the data lake strategy and I'm going to share some of those gains with you to be able to reinvest in your incremental product development plans and therefore your growth.","But the other thing is actually being in markets that are growing above the firm's organic growth level. So, where are those areas in IHS Markit that are accretive to growth and there, I think there is at least one or two areas in every one of our divisions that are driving long-term opportunity and growth. And can allow us to perform at the - at a more accretive level to our growth ranges.","So if you go in financial markets, I definitely have to say alternatives. It's double-digit, it's strong, it's anything to do with private debt, private capital and we're one of the largest players and there is lots to do.","So, I like that. The second thing I'd say is asset managers are feeling the fee squeeze and the ones that aren't - don't have substantive scale are finding the cost of serving up the technology and operations into their business as a percentage of those fees is growing and therefore, they need to - they need to reduce those costs and any of the information services providers will gain some of that opportunity then we're definitely gaining our share of that.","So that would be my cut at it - and there is other one, indices, AUM growth, passive, active, active - active product now getting new platforms coming, where active is going to get rolled into an ETF type structure. Those will bode well for IHS Markit index growth in AUM. So, therefore, if I look at financial markets, I move that up with Ipreo to six to eight, I'd love to see us be able to shift to the midpoint of that consistently or upper end of that.","In the energy space, I think they are the most exciting thing of course. We love the downstream pricing news all the PRA-type platforms where we compete against Platts and Argus and ourselves with OPIS and our pricing and news businesses. Those were accretive and strong upper single-digit growth, sometimes double digits. We are continuing to organically build out new product there, I see that as having a great TAM.","The other one is which I think we are underperforming, but have given our presence should outperform and therefore have a big piece of the pie is everything to do around energy transition, that transition from coal into renewables. It's the - it's all of our knowledge around LNG and the analytics around the LNG markets.","Again, driven out of our data lake strategy in terms of fast, strong analytics it's the marriage of transportation with commodities, again driven out of our data lake strategy. So in that anything to do around energy transition, clean tech renewables those are growth markets. We're right in the middle of them. We got to extract the right value and again, I'd like to see us break out of our mid-single digit range in energy, but you still have a volatile market around our business and our upstream still is 50%-plus of what we do, 60% of what we do. So I'm always a little bit cautioned there.","And then in automotive we've got lots of growth engines and we are accretive to our growth. So if you just looked at that, you'd say we should move to the - we should move up a percentage point or so on organic growth. But you do have to then temper your view with some of our dilutive to growth assets, some of the matured lower growth assets that are growing at 0% to 5%.","And that's the - that's the portfolio management, I'm going to call it an opportunity because challenge is not a fair word, but it's the opportunity for us and as we move through that, I think we'll continue to see progress to the upper end and - of our range and you know if we're consistently at the upper end of our range and beating it, then we'd be willing to move it up, but we haven't done that yet.","So therefore we are operating at a level where we're confident we can grow organically at what we say give a 100 basis points to shareholders, create a lot of free cash flow, use it very carefully framework of capital return to our shareholders with some small bolt-ons and drive double-digit earnings growth.","And when - and I think that should drive us to close the gap on the multiple differentials to the best in our space, and that's what we're trying to do. And when we're there, we'll come back with probably some renewed forecasts. It definitely gets easier as you grow at 6% or better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi","I just wanted to get kind of two updates. First on oil, obviously it's been in the news and we've seen some movement there. I was always under the impression that budgets were pretty much set for the year and that they would be reviewed at the end of the year. So, I wasn't sure if you're seeing any change in that? And then second, with the share buyback back in place, how do we think about the acquisitions? Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Do you want with start with - start off Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I think that's right with energy that essentially companies, these are long-term decisions so budgets get set, companies operate to those and it's why even though in your - you see some level of volatility in the underlying oil price, it doesn't really affect the operational decision, so long as the price remains within a range which we expect it to. So energy continues to be very stable and I've said this before, we're just grinding it out, and I think Dave, Brian, Dan, Jamie, the entire team at tool, they're really doing a good job of operating the business and we continue to expect to see improvement, but it will be - it will be over a period of time.","What was the second part of the question?","Todd Hyatt","Acquisitions.","Lance Uggla","Acquisitions? I mean, you can run the math, I mean our capital leverage is - policy is two to three times. We'll get below three in Q3 that allows us to resume the buyback, pencil out the $500 million for the year. That doesn't leave a lot of excess capital for acquisitions and then as we, every year we review the capital allocation strategy with the Board and we'll provide more color on the forward capital allocation as we move through this year, but I think this year is just set.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. And I think that we're also - we've also signaled to our investors and said very consistently, you should expect a very disciplined approach to our capital management and capital return to shareholders is a key part of our strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Just [indiscernible] how to think about organic growth in the downturn. You know, just given the [indiscernible] do you still expect to do positive organic churn?","Lance Uggla","Yes. So in each of our divisions, sorry, you were breaking up a little bit there, but I think I got the organic growth in the downturn. So high-single digits in automotive that's 7, 8, 9 in a downturn, we still feel our positioning around used cars, service lane and many other things besides new cars will allow us to maintain a high single-digit outlook, financial markets with fee challenges, growing alternative space.","We've got lots of - a lots of irons in the fire, and we think that our range there of mid-single digits shifting to the upper end of that 6 to 8 is a - is the right number. And financial markets are ones that move a little more consistently with the downturn, maybe you end up at the lower end of that and then you've got energy, which we really have been focused on diversifying away from upstream to have a much more balanced approach across the full energy value chain and then overlaying all of this with data lake strategy in terms of distribution of data and new product development.","I'm very confident that we can consistently operate in mid single digits with opportunities to accelerate above that. In a downturn, I don't see any issue with maintaining a positive organic growth across the firm, even if it was a severe downturn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Kevin McVeigh","Just following up on the buyback. Just a couple of things. Does the Informa exchange impact the timing of when you can be in the market, and is the $500 million, is that in the EPS guidance or would that be additional upside?","Todd Hyatt","No, and yes. So we will execute - for Informa, it doesn't affect the $500 million. I mean we - net-net, we end up with $30 million of cash and we have built in the buyback into the forward share count guidance. As I said, there is not a big impact this year. So it's a fully diluted weighted average share count, but it will definitely be impactful in 2020. We'll start off the year at a $8 million or 8 million lower shares. So it definitely will be a benefit next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Just wanted to come back to the margin in the financials business, I mean really strong performance, you mentioned a bunch of things including the integration with Ipreo. Can you just dissect this a little bit more, like various businesses that contributed, how much maybe the synergies are rolling into the margin yet. And then again why you're being conservative on the margin outlook here as we go into the second half? It seems like your - you've done a tremendous job already. So why is it not sustainable? Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","Well, Lance said this, I mean we've made good progress with Ipreo and the synergies and the integration and so, probably ahead in terms of the expense synergies, but we have ground to make up coming out of Q1. I still see high level of confidence in getting to the full-year number.","The big thing that I called out is that we will see a subtle shift in product mix in the back half of the year. We do have in the red compliance space, we'll see more revenue coming from that area that will be a bit lower margin.","And so, first half of the year, we had a very favorable product mix with high margin products in both information and software. And so we do see a bit of a reversal of that and then given the strong margin performance, we have a little bit of forward investment that we expect to make in financial services in the back half of the year.","Continues to be a really, really strong margin story and has been for three years now. But we want to manage the business for the long term and make sure we're making the right decisions and investing it in an appropriate level. So we do see margin expansion coming down in the back half of the year a bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi Todd, can you just explain to me why the resource's recurring revenue would decline sequentially. It looks like it went down like $1.7 million. Is there anything that's seasonal even there and then, I want to squeeze in one other one, just if - I didn't catch the Ipreo organic growth year-over-year, if you can throw that in as well.","Todd Hyatt","Remember that last quarter we called out a favorable point benefit from rev rec and resources, and I think that was the big thing and so we're actually trending at a normalized level right in line with where we've been in the last couple of quarters. And, with Ipreo, we don't call out specific organic revenue growth, but in the range that we provided that delivers to a 10% full year growth or a double-digit full year growth rate for Ipreo.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Just one last one on Ipreo, I guess, I know you just mentioned that 10% full year growth, which I think is lower than the low to mid teens expectation that you had, had in your first quarter foot note on the guidance slide. So, just given that Ipreo seems to be getting a little bit better, I just wanted to understand, was it just you don't feel like you can catch up as much after the weaker first quarter or I just wanted to understand why there is a lower expectation for the full year growth now.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. I mean I think we talked about that last quarter that we expect the business to rebound, it did. We're now at a run rate that supports the original range and as Lance said, as we move up in the next couple of quarters, move saying on a run rate basis inside to the middle part, mid to high part of that range, we don't expect to fully catch up the Q1. And so that's why in Q1, we went down to the lower end of that guidance range.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","You've previously indicated that you're on track to increase your market revenue run rate synergies from $35 million exiting fiscal '18 to a $100 million exiting fiscal '19. Can you discuss the progress of cross selling in the quarter and incremental initiatives you have going forward that can help drive a continued step-up in revenue synergies?","Lance Uggla","Yes, so. Thanks, George. I think the first thing I'd say is that the synergies across IHS Markit have definitely played out to be a real positive in terms of our merger and - if we can consistently drive 1% organic growth from the distribution of IHS Markit products into financial market participants, to me that's a golden outcome and that allows us to be up in terms of a run rate, up above the original view of $100 million, which I think I've said before, we are a little bit slower to start. But on a run rate basis, we've done a really good job.","What I can tell you is, I'm just coming off the back of a big customer trip. I've been in Boston, Montreal, Toronto, New York and now I'm in - we're doing the call here today from L.A., from Newport Beach and, you know, the fact is, I don't go to any customer meeting where I don't spend a lot of time talking about what we can do in terms of country risk measures.","What we can do in terms of supporting any types of investments into ex - energy exploration, Permian, LNG, energy transition and how it impacts investments. Our automotive experts getting called in to support a financial investment.","So, my view is this, the fact of being an information Company with financial markets as one customer set. That's a really strong place to be and we're continuing to extract a lot of value out of those revenue synergies.","I do think ongoing, if we have six points of organic growth, I'd be really disappointed if at least 1% organic growth is coming from the merger related activities, which gets harder and harder to measure, but the team, that's really been a real positive.","And then the second thing that I would say will drive organic growth, which we got out of the scale of the merger is the ability to take incremental margin that you can feel the pressure on the call of us giving more margin to our shareholders and what we're saying is, is we want to invest that margin to allow us to have consistent and better growth and the data lake is that type of strategy and I'll be really disappointed if, when we start to put out a vitality measure, if every three years when we look back, we're not getting 1% or 2% organic growth out of the vitality of our investments, I'd be disappointed with that.","So that gives you kind of the scale of the merger, plus the distribution of IHS Markit, IHS products into the market customer base into financial markets. That's a really strong outcome and one I think that we've been consistently performing against. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ashish Sabadra","Lance, great color on the data lake strategy. Thanks for all those insights. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that data lake would be, how does it also help provide cross industry insight in a differentiated view which none of your competitors have, because you have such a great portfolio of data asset across industry and maybe a follow-up for Yaacov, maybe if there are any examples that you can give of using machine learning or natural language processing or also on your cloud enablement strategy, any color on that front? So, anything on the technology front. Thanks.","Todd Hyatt","Okay, I'll take the first part and Yaacov can take the second part. So, to me, the key thing about the data lake strategy, first is very simple, because I hate all the buzzwords around data science, data lake, machine learning, a lot of natural language processing, a lot of these words, it really comes down to using technology to first, organize data efficiently.","Second, to allow structured and unstructured data combinations to be made more readily. Third, to allow your customers to more easily access data sets that you have. Fourth, to allow people across the firm in different regions that are doing R&D and product development to be able to gain easy access to data sets that they want to use and explore and that whole shifting environment in IHS Markit which really allows us to proclaim ourselves as an information company, leveraging technology to build better products for our customers and better products for our customers are something that's helping them make decisions, save money, do things more efficiently.","So, I'm just completely pleased that about, I just want it to be faster, but the fact is the team has done a great job and every day we're increasingly in a better place with respect to that tech strategy. Yaacov, you want to talk about a couple of the POCs that are leveraging more advanced data science, natural language processing, maybe the ECR, AD&S or maritime or...","Yaacov Mutnikas","So, just I'll answer - I'll comment in two ways. One, a little bit more color on the data lake itself and two about some of the examples of analytics that those cross border, cross - across different division lines. So just dipping a little bit into the data lake, so Lance mentioned the data lake is capable of processing and is processing today, structured, semi-structured, unstructured data throughout.","Number two, it's rooted in a coherent data catalog in data governance culture, where we've got now a data governance machine, how we manage data that's emanating in the lake, but that also creates a structure across the organization, how we manage our data.","Number three. We have an approach where we have got a process for the end of the year to hydrate our Data Lake with quality curated data. Number four, the data science, it doesn't address just issues of product innovation, but widely applies to data curation to which we have a process in place.","Second of all, I mentioned earlier is that we've got a way of since the data lake contains all the data across the board, across different business lines, we can now build products that we can merge data from, let's say, energy and financial sector through an unified data interface and cataloging capability. And so for the data lake in theory and in practice supports data management, data creation and product innovation. In terms of - just one part of the color to the thing, of course this entire exercise has to be done in the context of managing the cost of all the data management and data curation. ","And finally in terms of data science specific projects, one of the project that I wanted to mention is for example commodities at sea, where we can understand from our maritime business all movements of oil ships basically in the real time, out of that we can subset all the energy movements, all the oil movements across the world, we know any oil carrying ship where it's coming from, where it's going, at which point in time it's going to various points where these potential challenges, let's say like Strait of Hormuz et cetera. And we can understand and anticipate when the oil is going to reach various commercial centers and what potentially it can influence in terms of the oil value.","The other example that I will mention, we're launching in January a product which is our dividend focusing thing which is now supported by advanced machine learning techniques that going from manual effort of focusing 3,000 companies, we can focus 28,000.","And finally we've got a cognitive processing for news as it relates to terrorism, as it relates to civil unrest, political unrest, energy events and similar that all machine is now taking on data from roughly 16,000 open source sources to process classified data and help our analysts to opine on issues that are [indiscernible].","Lance Uggla","Thanks Yaacov. And we've got some - close to 20 different products being developed across the data lake now and most of them are using more advanced techniques and at least half of them are natural language processing and building real knowledge networks and indexing of content in ways that we just wouldn't have been able to do before unless we added a lot more people.","Operator","And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Eric Boyer","Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q2 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.","Our discussion on the quarter is based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers, which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance understanding of our ongoing operating performance, but they are supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited.","This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in IHS Markit\u2019s filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website.","After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q2 earnings call. We outperformed our expectations for the quarter and were able to continue to invest in our people, products, technology and customers for long-term profitable growth.","Some key financial highlights of the quarter are, revenue of $1.008 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 8% on an organic basis, and well above the upper end of our longer term range. We experienced broad based growth across the firm and all business performed well. Adjusted EBITDA of $398 million, up 13% over the prior year and margin of 39.5%. Normalized margin expansion was 110 basis points, excluding the impact of FX and adjusted EPS of $0.61, up 17% over the prior year.","Let me now provide some highlights. I\u2019ll start with Transportation, which delivered record organic revenue growth of 14% in the quarter. Growth was driven broadly with continued strength across autos, aerospace and defense and maritime and trade businesses. Financial Services reported 7% organic growth with strength across our information and solutions businesses. Within these businesses, top performers were pricing, indices, valuation services, managed loan services, reg and compliance products, and enterprise data management offerings.","CMS organic revenue growth was 4% as we continue to benefit from improving end markets and operational changes made within our product design, ECR and TMT businesses. Resources organic revenue growth was 5% as our upstream energy business continues to improve and our mid and downstream businesses remain strong.","As we discussed on our Q1 call, we held our annual CERAWeek conference in the beginning of March with record attendance and revenue which contributed to strong Q2 results. We are confident in our low single digit organic revenue growth outlook for 2018. We expect sustained global GDP growth and market dynamics to support our oil price forecast in the $65 to $75 range for the remainder of the year. However, we expect CapEx spend for IOCs to remain relatively tight as companies will remain budget focused, on shoring up their balance sheets and rewarding shareholders. 2019 should see a bigger increase in CapEx.","M&A update. In Q2, we also announced the acquisition of Ipreo and the planned divestiture of our MarkitSERV business. We are excited about the acquisition of Ipreo, which is compelling from both the strategic and financial perspective as it will help us shift our longer term growth curve higher and expand our addressable markets with limited incremental risk.","Strategically, we know the Ipreo business well and it is highly complementary to our existing financial service business, which we believe limits the risk. Ipreo will increase the size of our addressable markets including our presence in the primary and secondary capital markets as well as the alternative sector, a large and underpenetrated market with long-term double-digit growth prospects.","Financially, Ipreo has been a strong double-digit revenue grower and is expected to be accretive to our organic growth, allowing us to increase our long-term company goal from 4% to 6% up to 5% to 7%. The acquisition is also expected to be modestly accretive to our earnings in 2019 and will ramp from there. As we said on our Ipreo acquisition call, we are confident in our ability to deliver to Ipreo financial commitments and have multiple levers to ensure this happens including revenue growth from known market expansions, growth initiatives and revenue and cost synergies.","Finally, the sale process for our MarkitSERV business has kicked off in earnest. And we expect a robust process, given the early indications of interest. We expect to announce the sale in Q4.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. We were pleased with Q2 revenue and the continuation of positive trends from the back half of last year. Organic revenue growth of 8% was above the upper end of our long-term range due to organic recurring revenue growth of 6% and outsized growth of 15% in our non-recurring businesses due in large part to strong growth in our events [ph] and our automotive recall offerings.","Looking at segment performance. Transportation revenue growth was 22%, including 14% organic, 7% acquisitive and 2% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 12% recurring and 19% non-recurring. Non-recurring growth was driven primarily by our automotive recall offerings, and our annual maritime event. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect high single digit organic growth in our recurring revenue offerings but expect lower non-recurring growth.","Resources revenue growth was 6% including 5% organic and 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring and 14% non-recurring. Recurring organic growth was driven by our chemicals PGCR and downstream pricing businesses. Upstream revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis.","Our Q2 ACV across the entire Resources segment including OPIS was $714 million, which was up $5 million versus beginning of year sub-base. We continue to expect low to mid single digit sub-base growth for the year.","Non-recurring organic growth was driven primarily by record revenue from our annual CERAWeek event. CMS revenue growth was 6% including 4% organic, 1% acquisitive and 2% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 3% recurring and 10% non-recurring.","All of our CMS business lines, product design, TMT and ECR, posted organic revenue growth in line with overall segment organic growth. We expect CMS to deliver to its low single digit growth target in 2018, but will see negative growth in Q3 due to it being an off cycle BPVC year. Financial Services revenue growth was 9%, including 7% organic and 2% FX.","Information organic growth was 11% with strong performance across indices, pricing and valuation services. Processing organic revenue declined 3%. While the loan processing market continues to be strong, revenue was down due to difficult year-over-year comparisons. Derivative processing was flat.","Solutions organic revenue growth was 7%, led by our regulatory and compliance solutions, and continued growth in our WSO loan management and enterprise data management offerings. We expect to perform at the high end of our longer term 4% to 6% organic growth range for the year.","Turning now to profits and margins. Adjusted EBITDA was $398 million, up 13% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.5%, up 60 basis points on a reported basis and up a 110 basis points normalized for FX.","Regarding segment profitability. Transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $125 million with margin of 42.1%, an increase of 160 basis points. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $156 million with margin of 46.4%, an increase of 150 basis points. Both Transportation and Financial Services margin expansion benefited from strong revenue growth. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $101 million, which was up slightly versus prior year. Resources margins 42.4%, which was down versus prior year due in part to lower margin CERAWeek revenue and a modest increase in year-over-year Resources spend.","For the remainder of the year, we continue to target some investment spend in our Resources segment. CMS adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, down $2 million versus prior year with the margin of 21.5%.","Adjusted EPS was $0.61 per diluted share, a $0.09 or 17% improvement over the prior year. Our adjusted EPS includes an adjusted tax rate of 19%, in line with our full-year adjusted tax rate guidance of 18% to 20%. Our GAAP tax rate was 10%. On a full-year basis, we expect a negative GAAP tax rate due primarily to the estimated $136 million net benefit from one-time items associated with U.S. tax reform, which were recorded in Q1.","Q2 free cash flow was $323 million. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow improved to $851 million and represented a conversion rate of 58%. Excluding acquisition-related costs, conversion was 64%. We expect continued improvement in cash conversion throughout the remainder of the year and to be at our mid-60s target for the year.","Our quarter-end debt balance was $4.5 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times on a bank covenant basis and we closed the quarter with a $159 million of cash. Our fixed debt as a percent of total debt is 55%. We continue to target a minimum level of two thirds fixed rate debt by year-end.","As discussed on the Ipreo acquisition call, we expect bank leverage to increase to 3.6 times at time of Ipreo close. On a business-as-usual basis, we expect to delever below 3 times by Q3 2019. The divestment of MarkitSERV will further accelerate deleveraging. We have suspended our share buyback until we return to our target leverage of 2 to 3 times.","During Q2, S&P upgraded our corporate debt rating to BBB minus from BB plus. After Q2 quarter-end, we closed our investment grade bank credit facility with improved terms and conditions compared to our prior bank credit facility. We remain committed to managing the Company within our capital policy.","Our Q2 weighted average diluted share count was 404 million shares. Year-to-date, we have executed $752 million of share repurchases and have repurchased 15.9 million shares at an average price of $47.30.","In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our 2018 guidance from our March 27 earnings call but are increasing revenue by $25 million to reflect the strong Q2 organic revenue performance. For the year, we continue to expect $35 million revenue benefit from FX. The guidance provides for revenue of 3.85 to $3.9 billion with an increase in organic growth guidance to 5 to 6%. We expect solid revenue delivery in the second half of the year but also expect revenue growth to moderate due to more challenging year-over-year comparisons and lower non-recurring revenue growth.","We also expect adjusted EBITDA to be at the upper end of our current range of 1.5 to $1.525 billion. Margin will be negatively impacted by approximately 35 basis points from FX but we expect to deliver our 100 basis-point margin expansion target normalized for FX. Relative to items below adjusted EBITDA, we expect interest expense to be slightly above the top-end of the range but expect all other items to be within the current guidance range. We expect adjusted EPS of $2.23 to $2.27. The current guidance does not include Ipreo. We expect to remain within the current adjusted EPS guidance range, post Ipreo close.","We had a good first half of the year and are focused on delivering the shareholders commitments we made at the beginning of the year while continuing to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We look forward to providing further updates as the year progresses.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thanks, Todd.","I\u2019d like to acknowledge all of our teams around the world who collectively accomplished a lot in the quarter. We delivered strong results. We also announced the acquisition of Ipreo and the intent to sell our MarkitSERV business. We exited the first half of the year with good momentum and are set up well to meet our full-year commitments.","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Peter Appert","Thank you. Good morning. The Transportation performance has been particularly impressive here over the last bunch of quarters. So, I was hoping Todd or Lance, if you could just maybe unpack a little bit the drivers of the revenue growth, your confidence and the sustainability of it. And in particular, the margin performance relative to the guidance you\u2019d given earlier about potential dilution from the autoMastermind transaction. How are you driving the margin improvement?","Lance Uggla","Okay. So, I think, in the case of transportation, margin improvements coming from strong revenue growth. We are across the firm, very focused on the cost side as well, but we\u2019re starting to invest and make sure that we can maintain the higher end of our growth ranges.","I think with Transportation, we feel we\u2019re very well set up now for long-term high single digit growth with a very broad, diversified set of revenue drivers coming from VPaC, recall, digital marketing, CARFAX, CARPROOF, extensions into the new markets that we\u2019ve been focused on. And Masterminds is a piece of that puzzle. And together, we think our automotive and transportation assets can continue in a diversified way to give us high single digit growth longer term. So, I guess if you looked at this quarter, we\u2019d say, it\u2019s a quarter that outperformed. I don\u2019t know if Todd, you want to add to that.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. Couple of things I would add. I mean, this is the five-year anniversary shortly of Polk acquisition. And so, this performance has actually been delivered for I think five years. And there is strong business model, strong teams, and strong market position. And what we see as continued new product opportunity, continued analytics. And we expect those things will drive the forward growth.","In terms of margin, this is an area that we have invested in, we\u2019ll continue to invest at some level, but we\u2019re driving strong margins, and we\u2019ll continue to see margin expand as we move forward, but a lot of things working well in Transport.","The one thing I would call out. It\u2019s very heavy quarter for recall. And we do expect to see the non-recurring come down a bit in the second half of the year. Recurring will still stay very high -- high single digit range, but you should be aware of that. And we do expect non-recurring to come down from the levels that we saw in the first half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Meuler","Yes. Thank you. So, good quarter overall. Just on the Resources margin, you guys did a great job there in the tough revenue environment. How are you thinking about as the environment starts to recover the level of investment that\u2019s required. Should Resources margins remain under pressure? And then, I guess, just as a related question on the consolidated margin. Are you planning to continue to invest the -- reinvest the upside and deliver to the 100 basis points or as you have upsized margin expansion at Ipreo and automotiveMastermind and other drivers, would you potentially let more margin expansion on the 100 basis points flow through? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Let me start and then, Todd will add to that. So, I guess, on a 100 basis points, our view is that IHS Markit as a whole should be able to consistently expand margin. And our first target is that we get to mid-40s. And mid-40s to me sounds like 44 to 46. And we\u2019re some 4 percentage points away from the bottom end of that. But we think we have a reasonable number of levers across the group to drive 100 basis points of margin expansion. And we believe that a mid-40s is the right target for us as a firm. So, we are going to manage to deliver that for our shareholders. We\u2019d made that statement loud and clear in our last Investor Day, some 18 months ago. And we build our strategy around that. We also have told you that we\u2019re going to drive 4% to 6% revenue growth. At 4%, we think, we can get the 100. It gets tougher -- sorry, it\u2019s tougher at 4, easier as you push towards 6. And with Ipreo, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll move our long-term revenue growth to 5 to 7, so, up a point from 4 to 6.","And again, the 100 basis points margin, it will be harder at 5 and easier at 7. But, we\u2019re committed to the mid-40s target. We\u2019re going to be focused on delivering that over the next 3, 4 years. And we feel, we\u2019ve got ample levers to do so. And right now, we\u2019ve got strong global economies around all of our marketplaces. And it\u2019s up to us to take that -- to show up for that global growth and then expand and compete to take additional share. And that makes the whole margin delivery obviously easier, when you\u2019re performing at the upper end of your revenue range. Todd, do you want to add?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. The thing I would add specific to Resources, I would be careful when you look at an individual quarter margin about getting too fixated on a number, because you can have certainly a little bit of noise inside of any given quarter. What we see in Resources is this 42% margin level, a little bit more spend in Resources. You have business where we were really managing cost very tightly during the downturn, and as we\u2019ve seen a stabilization in the market, we\u2019ve had a bit of forward spend. But, we see that as really an opportunity to ensure that we continue to drive good forward revenue growth and take advantage of an improving market. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the way the Resources business is currently being managed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bill Warmington","So, question for you on the Resources business. The recurring revenue growth remained stable at 3% despite a more difficult comp and the ACV continues to grow. Looking into third quarter, fourth quarter, the comps continue to get progressively tougher. Do you think you can maintain that 3% type growth or better on the Resources recurring, heading into the second half?","Lance Uggla","Yes. I think that we\u2019re confident with the low single digit growth across Resources and see ourselves delivering into that for the year? Todd, do you want to add anything?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, just about how the business is performing. We do expect the sub base to prove a bit in the second half of the year, but low single digit is the place to be for 2018 in terms of reported revenue.","Lance Uggla","We do see the large IOCs want to look after their balance sheets, looks after their shareholders; we see that as a key piece of the strategy around Resources for this year and leading into more CapEx spending into 2019, which will bode well for the division.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Manav Patnaik","Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. So, I just had a question on thinking about your M&A strategy. I mean, I think at the Investor Day, 18 months ago or so, as you noted, I think the talk was a smaller deal than -- of what Ipreo was the size going forward. Is that opportunistic, is that a pipeline, just curious how you guys think about that?","Lance Uggla","No. I think we said when we did the Ipreo deal that it was somewhat outside of -- if you looked at the normal course of business, our view with that would have not been a tuck-in $500 million or less acquisition. It was larger and outside of that guidance. But when we looked at the combination of a MarkitSERV divestiture, coupled with Ipreo acquisition, we felt that that combination would allow for us to shift our financial markets growth curve up a couple of percentage points from 4 to 6, to 6 to 8.","It would do that in a way that expanded addressable markets into the big alternative space, which we see as a long-term growth driver and the combination of those two we could execute with limited risk to our forward financial plans but change our outcomes forward in a very positive way longer term. So, I think you should see us now retrenching back into that strategy, well, first to delever and then second to move back in smaller tuck-in $500 million or smaller type acquisitions. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Lance, can you discuss a little bit what you think happens in the transport business, especially in auto, in more of a restricted global trade environment? Are higher tariffs potentially a demand drive for you? And to the extent that for example there are tariffs implemented on European vehicles, in particular, does that mean that your used business gets a boost? Just kind of trying to think through the potential outcomes.","Lance Uggla","So, I think one of things I\u2019ve learned post merger about our automotive business is that it is very diversified, first across used and new car sales. So, that\u2019s a good thing. That gives us a diversified set of revenue drivers. The second thing is, is that the markets that we\u2019re in, the addressable markets in the different areas of our automotive franchise are ones that are large and have opportunity for continued expansion. So, let\u2019s walk through a couple of those.","So, if you go to first of all, we help the OEMs do their forecasting. That\u2019s subscription based business. They use our data. And regardless of the market environment we\u2019re in, they\u2019re still forecasting and they\u2019re still taking those subscriptions, and our teams are still helping them. And that\u2019s on a global basis. And we have price within that offering in terms of some growth. And of course, we have world class teams that help our -- help the OEMs do their job. And therefore, we see the strength in that part of our business. That\u2019s something that\u2019s very consistent regardless of the market environment and the global trade flows of automotive vehicles.","The second thing is, is we also see growth in automotive in China, in India, in emerging markets where the vehicle count per household is way lower than the developed economies. And so, we\u2019re starting to see nice growth for our offerings in those markets as well. Those are all subscription-based and aren\u2019t being pushed up or down by general trade flows.","The second thing we do is we play into the digital marketing. So that\u2019s targeted marketing, television; targeted marketing, social media; targeted marketing into gaming devices. And in that market, it really is a big billions of dollars per annum spend that\u2019s now shifting to a targeted market environment. And we\u2019ve seen excellent growth across digital marketing over the past years. And regardless of all -- some of the changes and challenges around customer confidentiality, we still see where there is an opportunity to place a targeted add to a qualified recipient, that\u2019s growth versus general, broad sheet, paper based advertising. So, we see that continuing and we see a big addressable market. And the stats suggests that\u2019s got growth forward.","We also use our Polk data to help OEMs with reporting on their emissions, outputs of their fleet. And that again is subscription based. We\u2019re good at it; we have a competitive edge with our data; it\u2019s subscription-based, it\u2019s business that we see regardless of whether there is -- whatever the volume of automotive sales into the fleet, that calculation still needs to be done regardless, and it\u2019s not done on a per car basis.","We also have in that automotive segment CARFAX. CARFAX, which is world leader, U.S. leader, with CARFAX, we\u2019ve rebranded CARPROOF to CARFAX Canada, leading in Canada. And we\u2019re expanding CARFAX into Europe. And here, the vehicle history report is the first piece that created our community, but we\u2019re now leveraging that into used car sales, insurance, banking. We\u2019re now looking at the service lane opportunity which is a big market. And we really do have some really great assets. And when you combine that with our recent acquisitions of Masterminds, you really do have a complete automotive footprint.","So, that\u2019s a big answer. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is we\u2019re confident in the high single digit growth, long-term diversified set of drivers. We believe, we\u2019ll continue to drive those numbers regardless of the global trade, potential for tariffs, some of the raw material tariffs that might come about. We feel our services are well-diversified and would play through that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Todd, I know Resources ACV includes OPIS in the second quarter as it did in the first. And so, when you look at ACV of $714 million, how does that look year-over-year? And could you describe how the second half has to come together to get to the low to mid single digits of sub-base growth for the year?","Lance Uggla","Yes. Andrew, we do expect to see some acceleration in ACV growth in the second half of the year. And we did see the ACV strength last year as well in the second half. I think, in terms of the growth rate, we\u2019re running at an ACV growth rate that\u2019s -- if we fully normalize FX-adjusted probably around 2%, we don\u2019t expect a big revenue lift in recurring subscription in the back half of the year. We understand the deferred revenue model and we expect some improvement as we move into 2019. But, we expect the recurring sub to be in the low single digit with some improving sub-base in back half for the year. And we\u2019re forecasting a low to possibly mid single digit sub-base when we get to year-end.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Can you talk about how market revenue synergies are progressing versus your $100 million target to the end of 2019 and in which areas you\u2019re seeing the most benefits?","Lance Uggla","Thanks, George. So, I\u2019ll take that, start, and then Todd can add if I leave anything off. So, the first thing I would say is that the -- we\u2019re well-oiled machine now in terms of focusing on synergies. And our account management across financial markets has a very strong working relationship with all aspects of our -- of the legacy IHS product groups ranging from TMT, aerospace & defense, maritime, upstream, chemicals and the automotive franchises. And they really are doing a great job at building pipeline and converting that into revenue synergies. And we exited last year at a run rate of somewhere around 12 million, 13 million, and we said that we would exit this year at 35 million. And I think I\u2019ve reconfirmed that 35 million twice. And I still feel confident that the 35 million is the correct number for this year. So that\u2019s all good on revenue synergies. And we\u2019re talking hundreds of executed opportunities, not 10 or 20. So, it\u2019s a lot of small 10, 20, 50, $100 million opportunities where we\u2019re taking information, insights and research from legacy IHS and selling into hungry financial market that\u2019s looking for information to make decisions.","The second piece that\u2019s been surprisingly exciting is where we took financial market data management software. We put a team on it for the first six or so months to build data management for an energy company to manage energy related data assets within the Company. And we\u2019ve now moved through ten sales, nice pipeline. And these are chunkier, 300, 500, $750,000 opportunities. And that\u2019s leveraging data management software we created for financial markets and brought it into the activities of an energy company.","We also had a record CERAWeek this year. And the CERAWeek this year, how it differed from other years, is it how the combination of financial market participants, technology, mobility, so that\u2019s the intersection of automotive with energy, and of course it\u2019s the world\u2019s leading flagship energy conference. So, what we\u2019re doing with that is we\u2019re bringing the strength of the entire company to bear around the perimeter of that conference, which is driving some very interesting revenue synergies as well. And we see that growing as we look forward.","So, all-in-all, I can say we delivered the first year revenue synergies, we\u2019re going to deliver the second year revenue synergies. And at the end of this year, I\u2019m going to have to give you the outlook of the 35 growing to a 100, which is clearly a bigger step up that as we come into the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll look at what did we do in fourth quarter. And for running at 15 million for the quarter, I guess, I\u2019ll feel really confident in the 100 million but we\u2019ve got two quarters to figure that one out. But for now, I think the teams have done a world class job and revenue synergies have been a pleasant and a continued upside.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. Lance, I was hoping you could speak to how you think about sustainability of Ipreo\u2019s growth profile. Specifically, I guess, what we\u2019re looking for is how cyclical is that business. I know you\u2019ve highlighted sort of 68% fixed reoccurring revenue but just curious how to think about cyclicality of that revenue base? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So, they have a capital markets business that definitely does well when issuance is higher. But you really need to break that down into munis, corporates, loans, and break it down into different asset classes. And there is -- if you look at the muni market, it\u2019s a pretty steady marketplace and one where you can forecast it very well. But, if you then go on to the fixed income or the corporate side, of course you can have some market volatility. But, as rates initially first start to rise, I think that generally bodes well for issuances, people look to get themselves, put into the marketplace at a reasonable debt level or interest rate level. I also think that interest rates in our economy are being managed in a way that is allowing for a slow and steady, careful set of interest rate rises. And I think that bodes well for some consistency. But there is a little bit of volatility around that and we\u2019ll take that within the forward plans. And we think that the combination of the overall Ipreo business will be well-positioned to hit its revenue forecast.","What I like a lot though about the forward growth plans of Ipreo, which I think play very well in all market conditions is the fact that the combination of the Ipreo, iLEVEL assets in and around the alternative market, which is about a $10 trillion market, there is about $1.7 trillion of dry powder to be invested in that market. And that market is expected to more than double in size over the coming years. And that market, like many others that HIS Markit has developed transparency, reporting, pricing tools, valuation tools in. So, if you look at what we did in the loan market, it\u2019s 5 to 10 years of steady double-digit growth as we built the tools to support the leverage loan market. I see the same opportunity in that alternative space. And I think that\u2019s the most important piece of the growth parameters of the Ipreo acquisition.","And then, finally, the investor relations platform of Ipreo is world class. It\u2019s best-in-class in the marketplace. The corporates need that regardless of the market environment. And I think our 50,000 corporate relationships can be married to that product in a way that in our IR platform that\u2019s important to a CFO or CEO to see their shareholding base, we will be able to enhance that platform with some of our key product that will be important to that CFO or CEO purchasing managers indices, credit default swap spreads of themselves and peers, short interest in their stock. We have a whole bunch of really unique datasets that we think will bode well to put either revenue upsell or making our products sticky vis-\u00e0-vis the competitors.","So I think we\u2019ve got multiple levers. And across that we\u2019ll deliver well to the plans we laid out. Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Lance, the other thing I would add is that with the exception of the municipal bonds, these are not fully penetrated asset classes in capital markets. So, there is opportunity from a market perspective to drive a greater level of penetration. There are regional markets that we\u2019re stronger in and regional markets that we have opportunity to continue to grow share. There are certainly a universe of banks that we can sale more products and services to. We can add add-on products to the existing solutions, and really the trend to automated workflow solutions, and these utility services, this positions us extremely well to capitalize on those. And then, also the opportunity from the broader financial services perspective to drive revenue synergies. So, I don\u2019t think you should look at this solely through the lens of capital markets activity and draw conclusion on ability to sustain revenue growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.","Alex Kramm","Lance, curious, if you could give us an update on MiFID II. Particularly, as I look at, I guess Financial Services performance and information in particular, do you feel -- or can you size up the impact, the positive impact you may have seen? I mean, some of your competitors are talking about demand for reference data, best execution and so forth. So, just wondering, if you\u2019ve seen the same thing, if you can size it up. And then, related to that, if it is a one-time step up this year as people get ready for new regulations, does it create a tough comp or headwind next year and also as maybe some of the unintended consequences kick-in? So, just some updated thoughts about the trajectory here? Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Okay. No. Good question, Alex. I\u2019d love to say that MiFID II has been the homerun. It\u2019s been a steady addition of revenue to IHS Markit, but nothing stellar that I would call out. But, what I would call out is the fact that large banks, we\u2019re seeing a lot of -- the business model of researchers providing research to the bank customers, we\u2019re seeing a lot of those individuals exit and the volume of research from leading financial market participants to banks is going down. And the research that\u2019s coming out of those entities is now being charged for.","So, I then look at what do we have. And I think it always shocks people. If I ask them -- if I sat down with UBS and said, how many people do you have doing energy market research at a senior level, there might be a team of 10, might be a team of 5, but it probably isn\u2019t a team of 25. If I look across IHS Markit, legacy HIS, and I ask you to tell me how many equivalent type researchers we have at IHS, I think you\u2019d be shocked, when I tell you that there is 1,700 of those researchers. So, we have significant research and content that goes out and gets paid for by market participants, mainly corporates, some financial market participants, governments, national oil companies, automotive companies, OEMs, big technology producers, solar tech investors. We have just this huge depth of research. It\u2019s like a fire hose of research.","But, when I look at it and I go how come we\u2019re not growing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% year-over-year into financial markets? All I can tell you is that we\u2019re making the investments, we\u2019re adapting the research, we\u2019re coming up with the way to sell it and price it correctly, and we\u2019re growing year-over-year and we\u2019ll continue to grow year-over-year for many years. But it\u2019s not a number that is ready to be called out, because we\u2019ve achieved something out of the ordinary. It\u2019s going to into our synergy number, we\u2019ve made the investments in resources, automotive technology on an organized team to sell the data and research. And we think MiFID II bodes well for us. So, conservatively, it\u2019s adding optimistically, it could add a lot more, but it\u2019s not doing it yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Lance, can you talk a little about the non-recurring revenue growth in the Resources segment. We\u2019ve seen three quarters in a row of pretty good growth, 8% -- 10%, 8% and now 14%. Is any of this stuff precursors to stronger Resources recurring revenue growth or could you just give us a little color as to what the non-recurring sales are and is it just that they\u2019ve been growing off of a low base or is there something that there is some momentum that\u2019s building. Just give us some color over there?","Lance Uggla","Right. Okay. Well, the first thing to call out is CERAWeek. So, that\u2019s one piece of the puzzle. And that\u2019s an excellent grower, both last year and this year and specifically in its reference quarter. The other thing I would say is as recovery and investment, higher oil prices, more projects being looked at now again, whether it is Brazil or offshore Africa, things going on in the Middle East, potential public offerings, all of a sudden the opportunity for us to take our experts in and consult to lead to subscription based revenue services is increasing. And therefore, I think that we\u2019ll see a managed increase of that year-over-year as we look forward. But we will manage it within the context of our recurring revenues, so that that mix is well-balanced.","So, it\u2019s really market conditions positive, a little bit of professional services around software sale, so we sell the software that\u2019s a subscription. But there is since some professional services around set up and implementation and that goes into the non-recurring bucket. So, nothing really extraordinary to call out, except that market conditions are bit better, and both the recurring and non-revenue components are moving up. And I think the non-recurring components moving up first in a bit faster makes a lot of sense to me. Todd, do you want to add anything to that?","Todd Hyatt","No, I think that covers it.","Lance Uggla","Okay. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open.","Jeff Silber","Thank you so much. I just wanted to go back to your guidance for the year. You raised the revenue guidance slightly; you\u2019re not coming in at the top end of the adjusted EBITDA guidance. I know interest expense might be a little higher than we thought. But just curious why you did not change your EPS guidance? Are you just being overly conservative or is there something else we\u2019re missing?","Lance Uggla","Okay. I\u2019ll pass to Todd. I think Todd did call out that we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re comfortable with the upper end of our range, moved revenue up a little bit, and we\u2019re half the way through the year with a half year ahead of us. So, I think that -- I thought that the numbers were fair. We\u2019ve tried to give a really consistent, open view to what we\u2019re doing post merger, and at this moment in time that\u2019s what we feel is a appropriate level of guidance for the marketplace. Todd, you were going to add to that.","Todd Hyatt","I think on the adjusted EBITDA -- adjusted EPS, as a I said, little bit higher interest expense. We want to accommodate Ipreo in the guidance. We see a penny there of drag at the time of that acquisition. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t have perfect symmetry between the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","MikeReid","Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. I appreciate you taking our question. Just looking at the information segment, was strong again for I think the third period in a row. Could you go into a little more detail, what was driving this thing there and maybe the expectations there going forward?","Lance Uggla","Yes. I guess, I\u2019m always surprised the information, double digit solution, now high single digits. I could have just as easily arrived and thought those numbers could have in the other way around, and I would have been equally pleased. So, I think that our performance in financial markets is well diversified. And it happens to be that being in indices and being the world -- one or two kind of world leaders in fixed income indices. We\u2019re showing up in a marketplace that\u2019s growing double digits and we\u2019re extracting our share of that and maybe expanding our share a little bit. So the teams have done a great job.","Pricing, reference data, these are all markets that are also growing, and they\u2019re growing internationally. International market participants are raising their bar and standards to global market standards. And therefore, they want independence, transparency. They want these products. And again, part of growth is showing up in growing markets. And then, the second part is actually expanding your market share and taking from competitors. I have to say that Adam and the financial markets team, they\u2019re doing that on a consistent basis. So, information, great job.","Solutions, managed by Yaacov, which includes all of our data science and analytics piece, it\u2019s a bit lumpier. But, I have to say, they\u2019re also doing an excellent job. And I think the combination of those coupled with our position in the loan markets bodes well for mid single digit growth. And that\u2019s something that conservatively you can put into your models looking forward and I think will bode well. Todd, you want to add?","Todd Hyatt","I think that\u2019s good. ","Lance Uggla","No? That\u2019s good. Okay, good. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Given that you haven\u2019t actually closed the MarkitSERV divestiture, I know you\u2019re looking at 4Q for that. And so, you don\u2019t know what price it will be sold at. But, could you just give us a sense directionally if the combination of Ipreo and MarkitSERV in \u201819 could be EPS neutral, or would it most likely to be dilutive? And then, given that MarkitSERV is you\u2019re expecting in 4Q to close the sale, would that be sort of concurrent with Ipreo, or would it be after? And so, therefore, like would you give -- hold the guidance call after Ipreo closes and then have another one when you close the disposition or how are you thinking of that?","Todd Hyatt","Relative to Ipreo, we gave very clear numbers for 2019, 370 of revenue, $115 million of adjusted EBITDA and said that it was modestly accretive. So that\u2019s Ipreo.","Relative to MarkitSERV, we haven\u2019t provide -- we provided a view of the size of MarkitSERV including revenue, margin profile. We\u2019ve -- as the process moves forward, we\u2019ll provide more information on that. But, we haven\u2019t talked about valuation with the MarkitSERV disposition.","Lance Uggla","I think, one thing, we could provide, which is how is, how is the process going. The team kicked off the process, Toni, once we announced it. I think, they\u2019ve signed between strategics and private equity, close to 30 NDAs. There\u2019s still 5 or 6 kicking about to be completed, early indications of interest. We expect by the end of this month, beginning of next. We\u2019ll narrow that group down. I can see with the number of strategics and the deep interest around private equity, it\u2019s going to be a robust process and one that should deliver a fair market value. And we\u2019d expect that we\u2019d get this announced before our fiscal year ends. So, I think it bodes well that there\u2019s a good process, it\u2019s robust, there is a lots of players. And, therefore, we should be able to drive it to a reasonable conclusion, barring any unforeseen events that we\u2019re not aware of today. So, no, I think the team has done a great job.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","David Ridley-Lane","In the past, you\u2019ve spoken about perhaps increasing technology spend in the near-term around cloud, information, security and so forth. Wondering if you\u2019re towards your full run rate today, if that is plan to continue, and how that sits in your broader margin expansion framework? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","I think as we look forward, we really are managing the Company in a way that we put out the 4% to 6% long-term revenue growth. We consistently -- we hit 6 twice; we now hit 8; and we\u2019re operating still in that 4 to 6 and we\u2019ve raised that to 5 to 6. And I think that that\u2019s a good operating level for the Company. With MarkitSERV out and Ipreo in, we move that to 5 to 7. What you\u2019re going to see us do as we look forward, we want to find all our strategic levers to give us a propensity to be at the top end of our range. And we want to manage our costs and manage our teams and our performance, so that if we come at the bottom end of our range, at the 5% level going forward, we\u2019re still able to deliver 100 basis points margin and work our way forward to a mid-40s margin target over the coming years.","Now, as we go above 5 of course, you\u2019re going to ask us for more margins. And our job is going to determine, what additional margin should we give as we head to mid-40s versus investment in people, products, technology and customer strategy. And I think our opportunity as a firm is to manage those four investment levers, so that our teams can consistently hit the upper end of the range because a 5% with a 100 basis-point margin can deliver double digit earnings growth; 7%, we can invest; we can have a higher propensity to stay at a higher end of our range, deliver 100 basis points, deliver double digits but if it is more consistent, more firm and more long-term, that\u2019s great for shareholders. So, our job will be the balancing act of those levers. And right at the moment, I can just say, I\u2019m really pleased with the team that they\u2019re consistently hitting in that 4 to 6. They beat it one quarter, that\u2019s good but, we\u2019re not going to brag about that because we might miss at one quarter and we\u2019re not going to be worried about that either. So, we\u2019re managing the Company for a long-term framework that\u2019s great for the Company, great for the customer, good for people, great for shareholders, and that combination is exactly what IHS Markit should be doing?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Trevor Romeo","Hi. This is Trevor Romeo on for Tim. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just had a quick one on the CMS margin being down almost 300 basis points year-over-year. I know it\u2019s only one quarter but is there anything you\u2019d call out is driving that? Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Yes. It\u2019s a good question because ultimately the margins are down. So, we\u2019re starting to see revenue growth. So, first of all, where is revenue growth coming? This piece of our Company is delivering -- and I\u2019m talking about product design here. It\u2019s delivering engineering specs and standards that we distribute and pay royalties to market participants that are building things.","So, whether it\u2019s an airplane plant, some set of infrastructure, we\u2019re supplying into that. So, GDP growth, global economy strong, expect revenue growth. But, the distributors and the owners of the standards have increased their royalties over time, and that\u2019s margin suppressing. So, our view as we look at our Company and we look at product design in general is we\u2019ve got a world class team, we\u2019ve got engineering work bench, we\u2019ve got Goldfire, the software around our product design driven by natural language processing. Those are all good components for growth, but they\u2019re going to come at to handle 25% margin type levels. But, if we can grow the revenue at high single digits instead of low single digits, good business, great team, that\u2019s what we should be doing. And within the context of the Company, I\u2019d be more than pleased with that result. TMT which is also in that number, we expect those guys to deliver high single digits over time and we expect them to open up margin. We expect the same out of Zbyszko who runs our ECR product, get us into mid single digits, expand margins, add customers. We\u2019ve got three great teams there, they\u2019re all doing what they\u2019re doing but don\u2019t expect a lot of margin out of product design. I think that\u2019s our last question, Eric?","Eric Boyer","Yes.

Welcome to the IHS Markit First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Eric Boyer ","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q1 2017 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q1 earnings release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website.","Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS Markit believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.","As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited.","Please keep in mind that the conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found in the IHS Markit filings with the SEC and on the IHS Markit website.","After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, Chairman and CEO; Lance Uggla, President; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions. With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?","Jerre Stead","Thank you, Eric, and thanks to all you for joining the IHS Markit Q1 Earnings Call. We will review our Q1 results, provide you with an update on our integration work and discuss some of the other highlights from the quarter.","We were very pleased to start the New Year as a merged company, which has combined two world-class organizations. Our colleagues began 2017 with a running start, having already worked together for six months. This provides a platform for us to deliver solid financial performance, while we continue to make great progress on our integration.","The high-level financial results in Q1 were revenue of $844 million, up 2% year-over-year on an organic basis; adjusted EBITDA of $320 million; and margins of 37.9%, representing expansion of 515 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.45, up 15% over the prior year. This quarter's results included good contribution from synergies, and we continued to have strong additional opportunities.","In terms of core industrial verticals, Transportation, which includes our automotive, maritime & trade and aerospace and defense teams, continued to produce very strong organic growth of 9% for the quarter. Financial Services organic growth, which includes our financial information, solutions and processing businesses, also performed very well with 7% organic growth.","And Resources, as expected, our energy business experienced a decline in our annual contract value. However, we continue to expect improvement through the remainder of the year as we see signs of the upstream market beginning to stabilize. Our Chemicals and OPIS teams provided continued strong performance.","Although our CERAWeek conference fell into our second quarter this year, I did want to share that we have record breaking revenues. This year's conference was without a question, one of our most successful, with new and innovative programs focused on new technologies in the industry, keynotes by top executives from virtually every major oil and gas company and from the Prime Minister of Canada. Discussions with our upstream energy customers and colleagues were ones of cautious optimism for the first time in several years, which is very encouraging. ","CMS total organic revenue was down 2% year-over-year. As we were preparing for this earnings announcement and call, it was remarkable to consider that we are marking the one year anniversary of our merger announcement. I'm so very proud of the work that our colleagues have done with the integration while continuing to focus on customers and continuing to deliver results as we're announcing today. ","Lance will talk more about our integration progress in a moment, and we'll be talking about future strategy and vision at our Investor Day on April 26. Lance has done a great job in driving the integration. We're now moving from our core integration work to the work of our future strategy and vision.","As we developed our three to five year plans, we reviewed our organizational leadership structure and determined that we could benefit from a further consolidation and simplification. Therefore, we will consolidate our commercial operations under the leadership of two of our operating executives. ","Jonathan Gear will continue to lead Transportation and Resources as well as our Consolidated Market segment. Adam Kansler will lead our entire Financial Services segment. In addition, Yaacov Mutnikas, Executive Vice President, Financial Market Technology has been appointed our Chief Data Scientist. In this role, Yaacov will be responsible for the implementation of new technologies around unified data and predictive analytics. He will also continue with his operational responsibilities. ","Finally, we're very pleased to announce that Lisa Westlake will be joining our company as our Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. Lisa joins IHS Markit from Moody's Corporation where she was the Chief Human Resources Officer. She also held management positions with American Express, Dun & Bradstreet and Lehman Brothers and brings that wealth of experience to our company. ","With these executive changes, I'm very confident we're structured appropriately to capture the vast amount of opportunities that are now in front of us. And with that, I'll pass the call to Lance.","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Jerre. Let me say it's great to be speaking with you again, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day. This morning, I want to provide you a quick update on our integration efforts. ","Since the merger closed in mid-July, we've been executing against our integration plan and continue to make good progress. As you'll recall, we accelerated the amount of cost synergies that we expect to achieve in 2017 from our original guidance at the time of the merger announcement. Our initial cost integration efforts are focused on areas where we had some of the most significant overlap, such as shared services, corporate functions and facilities. ","We are confident in our line of sight to achieve a total cost synergy amount greater than our $125 million estimate through 2019. We plan to reinvest these additional savings back into our business around a number of key initiatives in the areas of technology, product development, customers and colleagues. ","We believe these investments will better position us to achieve our long-term financial objectives on a consistent basis of a mid-single digit organic revenue growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-40s with at least 100 basis points of expansion annually. I look forward to providing more detail on these future investments at our Investor Day.","We've also made progress on revenue synergies, identifying a substantive set of financial market participants that have interest in our deep industry expertise and insights within Resources, Transportation and Consolidated Markets. Additionally, we have validated the potential to sell our enterprise data management technology into our Resources customers, and have had early success. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to providing you future updates.","Leading the integration effort has allowed me the opportunity to work closely with colleagues across the legacy businesses. I was able to take a step back from the day-to-day operations and to spend time better understanding the state of where our businesses are today, where we need to go as an organization in the future and to plan how we'll get there. I'm more convinced in the potential from this combination today than when we announced it last year. ","We have an incredible foundation built upon our market-leading assets, our colleagues and our customer base. We'll use some of the future financial benefits afforded to us by the merger to make measured investments to improve the productivity of our assets and colleagues to better serve our customers and to provide strong and consistent returns to our shareholders. ","I look forward to laying out our future path with you next month in New York. And with that, I'll turn it over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started with the results, I want to remind you that while Q1 results include IHS and Markit, prior year Q1 results only include legacy IHS. We've included Markit's year-over-year organic revenue growth and FX revenue impact in our revenue growth rates, and have included the remainder of Markit revenue as acquisitive revenue growth. ","Our Q1 absolute and organic revenue growth rates have also been normalized to take account of movement of CERAWeek from Q1, 2016 to Q2, 2017 and movement of our annual maritime event from Q2, 2016 to Q1, 2017.","Now for the Q1 results. Revenue was $844 million, an increase of 54% on a reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $320 million, an increase of 78%, with margin of 37.9% and margin expansion of 515 basis points on a reported basis. Adjusted EPS was $0.45, an increase of 15%.","Relative to revenue, we continue to see trends similar to those discussed throughout 2016. Total Q1 reported revenue growth was 54%. Organic revenue growth was 2%. Acquisitions contributed 55%, and FX was minus 2% headwind. Recurring organic growth was 2%, and non-recurring organic was 4%.","Looking at segment performance, Transportation normalized growth was 11%, which included 9% organic, 2% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 9% recurring growth and 10% non-recurring growth. We continue to see very strong growth in our automotive business and stable but lower growth in the other transportation businesses. We continue to expect all-in and recurring Transportation organic growth in the high-single digits but also expect non-recurring growth to moderate due to difficult year-over-year comparisons in our recall business.","Moving on to Resources, revenue declined 2%, including minus 8% organic, 7% acquisitive and minus 1% FX. The organic revenue decline was comprised of minus 8% recurring and minus 13% non-recurring. In Q1, on a constant currency basis, our Resources' annual contract value, or ACV, which represents the annualized value of recurring revenue contracts, declined approximately $12 million, which was in line with our expectations. ","We expect flat ACV in Q2 and flat ACV growth on a full year basis. This is due in large part to more stable price environment and more favorable capital spending budgets in 2017 than in the past two years. Our non-recurring energy revenue declined $3 million versus prior year, normalized for CERAWeek timing shift. This decline was primarily due to consulting decline of $1 million versus prior year base of $12 million and software and one times decline of $2 million versus prior year base of $8 million. ","We expect positive non-recurring revenue growth in Q2 due to the strong performance of our CERAWeek event and improved consulting performance. We are now forecasting the annual average price of oil to be in the mid to high 50s in 2017.","CMS declined 5%, which included minus 2% organic and minus 3% FX. Organic revenue was comprised of 1% recurring growth and minus 20% non-recurring. The non-recurring declines were in part due to the continued product rationalization within our TMT business. We expect positive CMS organic revenue growth in Q2 due to lapping of the loss of a significant customer contract in our RootMetrics business in late Q1, 2016.","Financial Services' revenue growth was 4%, including organic revenue of 7% and negative 3% FX. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 6% recurring and 30% non-recurring. Information organic growth was 4%, in line with the previous quarter. We saw steady growth across products, with particular strength in both our index and bond pricing businesses.","Our processing business delivered 12% organic revenue growth. This was driven by increased market activity in the loans market and mixed activity in the derivatives market, with the volume in rates steady and volume in credit markets lighter.","Solutions' organic growth was 10%, a significant improvement on the previous quarter. As indicated during our Q4 earnings call, this was driven by improved levels of non-recurring software license revenue. Our managed service business had another solid quarter and delivered double-digit organic revenue growth.","Turning now to profits and margins, Q1 adjusted EBITDA totaled $320 million, up 78% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.9% and represented margin expansion of 515 basis points. ","Taking account of Markit prior year Q1 margin, normalized margin expansion for the combined IHS Markit was approximately 200 basis points. Margin expansion benefited from our shared service cost synergies, which were allocated across all segments. In addition, our Transportation and Financial segments benefited from margin flow-through from strong revenue growth.","Regarding segment profitability. Transportation's adjusted EBITDA was $90 million with a margin of 39.9%, up 317 basis points. Resources adjusted EBITDA was $80 million with a margin of 40.6%, up 17 basis points. Year-over-year Resources' EBITDA declined $7 million due to the CERAWeek timing shift. ","CMS' adjusted EBITDA was $29 million with a margin of 22.6%, up 190 basis points. And Financial Services' adjusted EBITDA was $129 million with a margin of 43.7%, up approximately 200 basis points.","In the quarter, we recorded $32 million of acquisition-related expense, including severance, retention and contract termination costs related to merger integration activities.","Stock-based compensation expense was $75 million and included additional expense from revaluation of market outstanding grants and acceleration of certain share awards associated with severance activities post-merger as well as conversion of IHS PSUs to RSUs. We are expecting full year stock-based compensation expense toward the high end of our $200 million to $220 million guidance range.","Our GAAP tax rate was minus 6%, and our adjusted tax rate was 24%. Our effective GAAP tax rate benefited from excess tax benefit of $14 [ph] million associated with vesting our exercise of equity awards and share price increase from date of grant. This benefit is due to the accounting change, which reflects the excess tax benefit from share price increases as income tax benefit. ","Our GAAP ETR also benefited from merger-related expenses. Neither of these items impacted our adjusted tax rate, which excludes tax benefits from merger-related expenses and equity awards.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.45, an increase of $0.06, up 15% versus the prior year. Q1 free cash flow was $179 million. Our trailing 12 month free cash flow was $542 million and represented a conversion rate of 48%. Trailing 12 month free cash flow includes approximately $170 million of restructuring and acquisition-related cash costs. Excluding these cash costs, conversion would have been approximately 63%, in line with our long-term objective of the mid-60s.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter-end debt balance was $3.7 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times on a bank covenant basis. And our quarter-end cash balance was $155 million. ","In the quarter, we increased our bank credit facility with the addition of a $500 million, one year term loan, and we completed a $500 million, eight year note offering at a 4.75% coupon rate. These proceeds were used to pay down our revolver, and at quarter close, our undrawn revolver balance was approximately $1.2 billion, which provides sufficient liquidity to execute our share repurchase commitments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 422 million shares.","In the quarter, share repurchases were $592 million or 15.8 million shares, an average price of $37.50. The share repurchases included $492 million of our $1.2 billion buyback commitment as well as approximately $100 million from stock option proceeds. We also executed a $200 million ASR on March 1. We will continue to use a combination of ASRs and open market share repurchases to execute against our repurchase target.","We are reaffirming our 2017 guidance, which we provided on our November 14 guidance call. In terms of highlights, this guidance provides for revenue in the range of $3.49 billion to $3.56 billion. This represents 2% to 4% organic revenue growth, negative FX impact of approximately $50 million and acquisitive revenue of slightly less than $20 million from the CARPROOF and OPIS acquisitions. ","Adjusted EBITDA of $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion, which represents margin of 39.4% at the midpoint. And adjusted EPS of $2.02 to $2.08. As a reminder, to help you with modeling, CERAWeek has moved from Q1 in 2016 to Q2 in 2017, and the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code will be in our second half results this year. Prior year CERAWeek revenue was approximately $15 million at relatively high incremental contribution margin. Boiler Code revenue is approximately $10 million and is relatively low margin.","As discussed at the time of the merger announcement, IHS Markit is well positioned to drive attractive shareholder returns given our financial scale, substantial cash generation, return on capital strategy and revenue, expense and tax synergy opportunities. This combination creates a very attractive financial lens.","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Jerre.","Jerre Stead","Thanks, Todd. I want to thank our colleagues who worked tirelessly over the past year in getting us to this point, where we hit the ground running. Moving forward, we expect to benefit from improved energy markets and are focused on investing for profitable top line growth of our business to provide continued shareholder value creation. We very much look forward to sharing our strategy for IHS Markit's exciting future at our Investor Day on April 26 in New York City.","Now Lance, Todd and I are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.","Peter Appert","So Jerre, I was hoping you might just give us a little more color on what you're seeing within the Resources business, maybe some specific metrics possibly on what you're seeing in terms of pricing, renewal rates, et cetera. And I'm asking this in the context of CapEx within the industry looking better, and wondering if you're seeing any flow-through benefit in terms of your benefit to your businesses.","Jerre Stead","Great question, Peter. Thank you. As Todd said, and I did, we had a $12 million downturn that we expected in Q1. We also expect that to be flat in Q2 and for the year, flat. So you can think about second half positive. ","Pricing is where we continue to be -- as you know, we don't cut prices during that period of time. Certainly, a lot of our customers have reduced their usage of the regional pricing model, but that'll come back with time. ","Renewals are running very strong, as we would expect them to as we go forward. We had a very deep dive a week ago Investor Day with Q2, Q3 and Q4. I'm feeling bullish. If you saw the press release, I'll let Todd take the credit for this being the bottom of the barrel and on the way back up, but we feel quite positive about it. ","It's been almost three years, as you all know, and very much look forward to showing improvement as we come out of 2017 to positive organic growth in 2018. Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC. You may begin.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, if I can just follow-up on that, can you give us a little color about what's going on within the base? A quarter ago, you'd talked about some of the multi-year contracts that were going to renew around year-end and -- but that a lot of the base then had renewed down. Are you seeing pockets that are growing their spend? Some pockets that are still shrinking? Is it stabilization across the base? Just any incremental color to help there.","Jerre Stead","Good question, Gary. The minus $12 million was specifically those three year agreements that we talked about in Q4 results year-end, hit exactly as we expected. We've mentioned historically, and we'll -- I'll turn it over to Todd in just a minute with some specifics, but we haven't, indeed, seen increases, including on both pricing and usage, on a regional basis geographically in Q4 and certainly in Q1. ","Todd, you want to pick up, including Texas, for sure.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. So Gary, when we evaluate this, we stratify the accounts and look at the accounts above $0.5 million account by account and then all the way down to accounts below $100,000. I think a couple of things that we're seeing. One, on the large accounts, these strategic changes that we talked about on prior calls going back last year where large customers were dropping coverage, strategically shifting their operations, we really see that we've cycled through most of that at this point. ","So a couple of things out there that -- but we don't see those as being hugely impactful. I think the bigger thing is in the smaller accounts, the less than $100,000. We're actually seeing very good growth coming from our inside sales business. That's largely a U.S. based business. And in the U.S., certainly, capital spending is increasing in the U.S. this year. The Permian is a very hot area. ","So we do see -- when we've really been impacted by the smaller accounts over the last couple years, we actually see very good traction in this tail of the business. So really, the large accounts stabilizing, strategic changes having been largely made by the big companies and then the smaller companies' good growth, really, in our inside sales group.","Jerre Stead","Thanks, Gary. And for those of you that were able to attend CERAWeek a couple weeks ago, the difference in attitude with all of our customers was noted very positively. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Bill Warmington","Thank you. Good morning everyone. So I wanted to ask a question on the Transportation business. You had mentioned strength there. Automotive had historically been about three-quarters of the segment. And I wanted to ask, how is CARFAX and CARPROOF doing versus the vehicle registration or park info? And any change in demand in products for new versus used vehicles?","Jerre Stead","Great question, Bill. Todd, do you want to pick those up? That's a good question.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, the Automotive, as you said, Bill, it's a bit north of 75% of Transport; continued to perform very well in both the used car and the new car parts of that market. In the used car, the new products, the used car listing product, continues to perform well. The business insurance area is a very strong grower. And even the core advantage business is growing at a strong rate. ","In the new car business, we talked about the big growth drivers in the past. Digital marketing being very strong. The emissions product that we released last year has been a very good grower. We continue to feel very good about all pieces of automotive. ","The thing I called out on the call is the non-recurring. We had points where we were hitting teens growth rates in non-recurring last year. We don't expect that to continue. We see some tough comps, particularly in recall. Recall continues to be good. But we do see the non-recurring still being a mid-single-digit grower, but that will back down just a little bit this year.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Bill, next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Henry Chien","It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. ","Jerre Stead","Hi, Henry. How are you?","Henry Chien","Hi, I am good, thank you. I just had a question on the reorganization or the consolidation, some of the leadership changes you mentioned. Is this more of a cost kind of move? Or is there a strategic shift? And any kind of color you can provide, whether you're changing how you're going to market or your sales team or any kind of changes there.","Jerre Stead","No, thanks, Henry. Good question. It's, for sure, not a cost move. It's to streamline our organization. One of the things Lance and I have worked on, actually for a year now, is to make sure that as we exit 2017 and we go into 2018, we've got exactly the right organization for years to come. And in this case, you think about the big businesses, that's what we've lined up. But pick up on it, Lance.","Lance Uggla","Yes. I think, Jerre, you said it's in the release in terms of simplification. And so these moves really do simplify the overall organization and give us the right operating structure to take the company forward for the next five, ten years.","Jerre Stead","That was our target. And I think we're right on that. Thank you, Henry, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Dobell with William Blair. You may begin.","Brandon Dobell","Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe some, I guess, further color on how you guys think about the revenue synergy opportunities playing out here and whether or not the changed administration has you think any differently about what -- or how to sell some of the things in the Financial Services.","Jerre Stead","I'll start, Lance will pick up. We feel very good as we move forward on the cross-selling Brandon. For sure where we're at today is we'll give you -- and I hope you're there. I hope everybody in the call is there at our Investor Day. We'll actually give you examples of -- including customer names, of the cross-sell that we're feeling really good about. Give a little color, Lance.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So I think, again, in our discussion, we talked a little bit about two things. One, about financial market participants have a propensity to acquire data and use it to make decisions. And we're providing our content in its raw form as well as in a -- in a service around research, valuations, insights. And Financial Market participants have been hungry to learn about the data sets of the combined company but have also started to acquire those data sets in the services that we have available for them. ","So that, we see a nice runway for a long time to come, and the pipeline continues to build. The other one we talked about and I gave -- mentioned in the early part of this call was the use of our data management technology, which has been used for many years by financial market participants to organize their data sets in order to create providence and cleanliness of the data sets they use to do their business. ","When we reached out into the energy companies, we found that they as well, dealing in multiple different data sets across the commodities markets, had similar issues and challenges, and we've had early successes with taking our data management products and adapt them -- adapting them to the energy markets. ","So those are two good examples. But as Jerre said on the Investor Day, we'll get into some real examples, real demos and show you some of the products that we're creating together.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may begin.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Todd, I want to ask you about your ACV prepared comments. After saying ACV should be flat for 2017, you went on to indicate that the IHS oil projection should be in the mid to high 50s for 2017. Obviously, oil prices right now are in the high 40s, having dropped during CERAWeek while we were there together. Do oil prices need to meet the IHS forecast of mid to high 50s for ACV to be flat this year?","Todd Hyatt","Andrew, it's -- the primary driver is the spending, the capital spending, the budget cycles of the energy companies. And we don't see high 40s versus mid-50s as being impactful to our projection around sub-base for the remainder of the year.","Jerre Stead","Thanks Andrew. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Mueler with Baird. You may begin.","Nick Nikitas ","This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Just looking at the Financial Services segment and the organic growth improvement there, obviously, information is pretty steady, and you saw some nice improvement within solutions and processing. Can you just talk about the sustainability for both of those sub segments over the back half the remainder of 2017?","Jerre Stead","Yes, it's a great question. Todd, you start. Lance will wrap up.","Todd Hyatt","Well, information we see as being very sustainable in this 4% to 6% long-term growth rate area. There's a great set of pricing reference data, economic indices, valuation services. We have always liked that part of the portfolio. So we do feel good about the ability to continue growth the way it's tracked historically, even in the legacy market world. ","Processing is driven by activities in the marketplace. And so there is more variability around processing from a market activity standpoint. And it's been a relatively strong loan market in the last quarter, and we'll all see how the market goes over the remainder of the year.","Jerre Stead","Lance?","Lance Uggla","No, that's -- I agree that what Todd said was perfect in that I do think that, as I mentioned a bit earlier, the propensity for financial market participants to consume information is high and has grown throughout the -- our life since the financial crisis. ","So spending on information is a core strategic component of the bank's strategy to do their job better, and we see that staying. We're -- that 4% to 6% range we see as a performance level that's available to us in the market. And we expect to -- as a long-term objective, to be within that. Processing is volume related. We have the connectivity. ","So the big infrastructure spend to connect to us is there, but the volumes are variable on top of that. And so 12% is a great organic growth number, coming from a lower base a year ago. But with low interest rates, one, the propensity for loan market participants to lock in, that's a positive. ","And two, when there's currency market and interest rate volatility, you find the derivatives processing volumes to pick up, and our charging mechanism is a per trade, and so it's not about the absolute size in dollar value but the propensity for those institutions to trade. And we see that -- we saw good strong organic growth in the processing from derivatives. ","And then on -- the final thing on solutions, the industry continues to look for ways to reduce their costs. We're active in and around document management, tax, KYC, vendor compliance, digital services, all great areas to be in and collectively back to 10% organic growth, which is good to see.","Jerre Stead","That's excellent. There's a really good article in The Wall Street Journal on that very subject that Lance just covered this morning. So it just even justifies more of what we're doing. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may begin.","Ryan Leonard","Hi, this is Ryan filling in for Manav. Just wanted to touch on the synergies comment. I guess, Lance, you made it sound like $125 million is now the minimum. And I guess maybe what have you seen so far that gives you confidence that, that can be exceeded? And is there any type of -- is that the initial bar and you see another leg starting in -- after 2019? Or do you think there is more upside within that time frame?","Jerre Stead","I'll start, and Lance will pick up. What we feel very good about is that we've laid out, we actually measure by week what we're doing and what we said we were going to do. And what Lance was trying to say was that the $125 million, we have high degree of confidence. Lance, pick up on the second part of this question of the future and where we're going.","Lance Uggla","Yes. I think -- I agree, Jerre. We're -- our comments earlier were that we felt the $125 million is in hand and that as we exceed that, we'd look to reinvest strategically in to four areas in the firm. All that would give us a higher propensity to move our organic -- move stronger into our organic growth ranges, and those areas were technology. ","So one key strategic area that we focused on throughout this merger period is looking at all our technology assets and how we can rationalize those as well as improve them for future product offerings and growth. Two was around colleagues in terms of learning and development and training and leadership. ","Three was with respect to our customer experience and online and inside sales. And then finally, the four, the last one was incremental product investments. And so we're looking to invest with any over performance, and we feel confident that we've done a great job to be able to do that.","Jerre Stead","And I'd just add two things to that because -- well, you'll see that in Investor Day. One, we're spending and built into our plans, in delivery and guidance, a lot of money this year and creating the background. We'll be 100% when we exit the year on a common Salesforce.com system. We've put our SAP systems together. We've got an entirely new human resource system going into place as well as integrating all of our backroom communications. So that's a big deal. That's built in. ","So the second comment that you'll hear more about in our Investor Day is that we expect that to deliver a situation that will allow us to provide 100 basis points of margin improvement for years to come, year-after-year as we deliver going forward. Thank you. Great question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you. Hey, in terms of the 2% to 4% range, nice job on getting the 2% in Q1. What are the puts and takes to get you kind of from the low end to the high range? And just to follow-up on that, what is the overinvestment due to the longer-term organic growth? Like is there a way to think about how much it should boost your organic growth as you pull some of these overinvestments on the cost synergies and put it back into the business?","Jerre Stead","Great question. I'll start on the second part and have Todd pick up. When we look -- you just heard Lance talk about a target of 4% to 6% organic growth. The beauty of a subscription-based business where 85% of our revenue is recurring is that when you get north of 5% and you control the costs as well as our teams are and will continue to, that generates basis points for years to come. ","And I think we feel very good about that. What Lance was talking about and we are going to do, again, you'll see it much more in a few weeks, is invest in opportunities that allow us to get to the upper end of that 4% to 6%. When we hit that, get north of 5%, we'll see lots of returns coming. And Todd, do you want to pick up?","Todd Hyatt","Well, the things that get to the higher end of the revenue -- organic revenue growth are really the positive things that we talked about on this quarter. The stability in energy, improving energy through the year, good performance, very strong performance from financials, transport continuing at this high single digit level and then the CMS starting to turn the corner and move up. I mean, those are all positive signs. ","Now we have to continue to operate well as we go through the year, but those are certainly things that we wanted to see at an early stage to the year. Relative to the second part of the question, which is really this trade-off between revenue growth and margin and investment, for us, obviously, the revenue growth makes margin easier. We talked about that in the past. ","And so this 4% to 6% range that we talked about as a longer-term objective for the company, operating in that range, we believe, allows us the ability to deliver the type of margin expansion that Lance referenced on the call, this 100 points a year as well as also making investment in the business.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. You may begin.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Jerre Stead","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","Lots of good ones already asked this morning. Jerre, I'm thinking back to a couple years ago in the context of some of the workflows you talked about and were designing in Resources. How do you think about those workflows in greater integration into your customers' day-to-day functionality in terms of the growth in Resources and market demand notwithstanding? ","In other words, is that now -- would you think now about those in terms of cross-sell and revenue synergies? How does that all fit into the go-to-market strategy?","Jerre Stead","Yes. Those are the investments we made in new products, actually, products that would pull us into the financial world that we had not been in previously. Feel very good about those. You'll see demos, as Lance talked about, at our Investor Day of those products being sold. ","In -- we've had -- both Lance and I have had the pleasure of being part of some of the sales of those going into financial institutes. Feel very good about those. As you remember, our last Investor Day, which was actually October 2015, we moderated the expectations of what we thought the -- those new products would be. ","I'd say today that we're on track with those and feel very good about the cross-selling as we go forward. Todd, anything?","Todd Hyatt","Right. I think the platform investments that we've made historically position us for what we plan to do in the future.","Jerre Stead","And I'd just add one thing, because Lance has had a chance, as Yaacov, for instance, to see the biggest platform, and we put a lot of additional information there. Economic country risk is now on there. We've got -- if you think about the Connect platform, it serves a purpose that will continue to expand for years. ","Two things it does do is give us a much easier entr\u00e9e for our customers. Equally important is it reduces our cost to maintain all of those separate products significantly. We announced today the critical move of Yaacov becoming our Chief Data Scientist. That's a place that you'll see us investing in years to come that'll create predictive analytics, that nobody else has done, at the same time reduce our infrastructure costs. Great question. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to come back to the comments you made earlier on Transportation or particularly around autos. Sounded pretty positive what you're seeing out there. There were a few headlines in the last few weeks here about used car price indices dropping -- the biggest drop we've seen, I think, since 2008. ","So just wondering, has that changed anything in terms of the outlook? Do used car prices at all have an impact, positively or negative, on your business? How would you be thinking about it?","Jerre Stead","That's a good question. I'll start, Todd will pick up. Anything that is out of the normal is good for us. And you're right, I saw the article where used cars -- this is U.S. only, as you'll remember, and probably going on in Canada, too. Used cars prices have varied. What that does is drive an appetite for people, when they read that and understand it, to come online and use our information with CARFAX to make even better decisions. Todd?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. The used car market in North America in terms of number of vehicles sold doesn't vary a lot. I mean, it sits around this $42 million -- or 42 million-unit level. But what we do is we allow dealers to more effectively participate in that market, and we provide information to consumers to make good informed decisions. ","So the market pricing doesn't -- as I see it, doesn't really have an impact on the underlying business and the services that we provide.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may begin.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Hey, Lance, I just wanted to get a sense of your commentary about investing the excess of $125 million to drive better organic growth. Is this something that you're looking at in the interim? In other words, you're seeing through the target years of fiscal year 2016 that you're going to exceed those cost savings, and therefore, in the near term, you have more money to invest in that? Or is this kind of over a longer period of time? I'm just trying to understand that side of organic growth.","Jerre Stead","Pick that up, Lance. Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So well, first off, in terms of our strategic priorities, we've given you a little hint of those today in terms of the four areas that we've looked very closely at. I've had a great opportunity where -- with Jerre running the company, I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with the teams globally. ","And really, the excitement from the merger to now is really about the opportunity set of the great assets we have in terms of people and product and customers. And so we looked globally at the three or four areas where we felt we could put some incremental dollars to work that would give us a higher propensity to hit higher ends of organic revenue growth as we look forward into 2018, 2019, 2020. ","So that's what we're doing. What you'll see in terms of detail on that will come out at Investor Day, and so let's not jump the gun because the teams have put in a lot of great work where together, we'll be presenting and talking in detail those strategic initiatives. And we'll give you a lot more insight then. But we're on track on the synergy side. We're creating room to invest, and we're excited about that combination.","Jerre Stead","It's a great example of what a merger of equals really does. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from David Chu with Bank of America. You may begin.","David Chu","Good morning, maybe a question for Lance. Can you just provide an update to the timing of electronification in Europe? Just wanted to see if this is still expected to be a 2018 event and maybe you can share the potential impact.","Lance Uggla","You're talking electronification in terms of...","Jerre Stead","Processing.","Lance Uggla","In terms of processing, okay. Sorry. So, no. So we -- so processing is -- as you know, is diversified across the loan markets and then within the derivative markets and FX. So quite a well-diversified suite. The -- we've seen little impact to date in terms of the electronification of markets. And in terms of a percentage of our overall business and revenue, it's very small.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning, thank you. Just a question, if you could maybe frame for us the extent to which the non-recurring business is a good indicator of your re-occurring or sub business coming back? And is there still an opportunity to shift to a larger subscription mix from moving business from non-recurring to recurring? I know you mentioned some product rationalization in TMT. Thank you.","Jerre Stead","Yes, great. I'll start, Todd will pick that up. Yes, TMT is in the process and has done that last year and this year, small part of our business but has done a very good job of moving from a transaction base to an annual subscription base. I said a few minutes ago, we're north of 85% of recurring revenue. That's remarkable. ","And if we can keep it at that level and still get the kind of non-subscription-based business, we'd be very happy. Indicator-wise, so just give a thought on that, Todd, because there's really not much indicator difference, but non-sub versus sub.","Todd Hyatt","Yes. A lot of the non-sub products, I guess the transactional orientation of those products provides -- in an up market, probably get a bit of a lift, and in a down market, we probably would see the transactions start to drop in advance of the subscription. ","But I don't know that there's a perfect correlation in that. I think when we look at energy, we see consulting is improving, pipelines are improving, backlogs are improving. We would expect to see improved non subs in energy and start to lead the way out of energy through the remainder of the year. ","We talked about this the CERAWeek event. We were happy with the performance of that event on multiple counts. So not a perfect correlation but certainly indicative at times of what's happening in the larger markets.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse.","Anjaneya Singh","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. ","Jerre Stead","Good morning.","Anjaneya Singh","Had a follow-up on the non-recurring resources piece. It seems like the normalized organic growth worsened a little bit. Realizing it's small dollars, hoping for some more granularity there. With consulting, it seems like a small decline this Q versus flat last Q. Is this a little bit of choppiness in line with your expectations considering the stability in oil prices on a relative basis? ","Are the software maintenance fees taking more time to normalize than you had thought? And then finally, Todd, I think on your expectations of positive growth in this non-recurring resources piece, is that also positive if we were to normalize for CERAWeek?","Jerre Stead","Great question. Pick that up. The answer to that last part is yes. But just pick up the software and the consulting.","Todd Hyatt","Well, the first point, as you said, the numbers are relatively small. So consulting was down $1 million year-over-year. We do have a good strong pipeline as we look at the next three quarters. And we do expect to see some improvement of consulting as we go through the year. ","The software, a little bit longer sales cycle around the software. Certainly, our expectation is that we can have some success in software as we go through the year. But I think that is an area that has lagged, and we do see that software has been -- year-over-year, the software, the other one times have been down a bit. On balances, we look across non subs for energy. We still do expect a positive grower for the year.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, I wanted to revisit Financial Services. I think we talked a little bit last quarter about getting some uplift from a better bank outlook. Did that happen? Will it continue? And any noticeable shifts in budgeting there?","Jerre Stead","The question that you referred to was what did we expect to see with the Trump regime, if you will, and we said any change is good and uncertainty is great. And if you're wondering about uncertainty, I think what goes on every day today. But pick it up, Lance.","Lance Uggla","Sure. So we definitely -- I think part of the positive results come from the election. And that's given bit steeper yield curves. So that's given some -- a flow of profitability into financial market participants here in North America. In Europe and Japan, getting away from a negative rate environment, it's positive for banks. A view that there might be a tax shift in the U.S., positive for banks. ","So there's a general optimism for the North American participants post that election. And I think that gave some rise to additional loan processing volumes, which we've seen come through in terms of revenue. People thinking that rates might rise have a higher likelihood of walking in lower rate, so we saw that. ","We took advantage of that ourselves in terms of our issuance. The second thing is that you've got some volatility also in the world with uncertainty in terms of commentary coming out of Europe and North America, and that creates trading volatility, which plays well into our processing business as well. So a general kind of additional revenue, incremental revenue in processing on the back of the election.","Jerre Stead","Thank you, good question. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Patrick Halfmann","Good morning, this is Patrick in for Toni. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit of color around Resources margins during the quarter. It looked they were pretty much unchanged year-over-year.","Jerre Stead","Happy to do that. I'll start, Todd can pick up. If you look, we now have our three largest businesses all delivering 40% margins or better. If you think about Resources, when the revenue has been down consistently for 11 quarters now and delivering north of 40% margins, you can think what will happen as we predict the positive revenue growth coming into 2018.","Todd Hyatt","Yes, I did call this out. We normalized the organic revenue growth to take account of the CERAWeek timing shift. But when you look at the reported numbers, obviously, Q1 of this year does not have CERAWeek. Q1 of last year had CERAWeek. That's a -- CERAWeek's a relatively good incremental contribution margin. So as a result, we were down on EBITDA year-over-year and didn't have as much margin as we -- margin expansion as we would have otherwise had. So that is an impact. ","Now I also said that we don't expect Resources to be a significant margin -- to have significant margin growth this year. It is negative revenue growth on a reported basis. And so basically, the two forces we'll see in Resources, on margins for the year are -- we'll see benefit from flow-through of the synergies that are benefiting all of the segments, and then we'll see lower revenue growth having some impact in the other direction.","Jerre Stead","And as I -- it's a great question, as we wrap that up. Like I said, you'll see then the margins, as we see the growth turn positive in 2018, we'll enjoy the margin recovery. I'm very, very proud. We all are, of what the Resources team have done in total during this very, very difficult time, managing costs very well in preparing for the uplift. Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Andre Benjamin","Thanks. I guess just a question on processing, some combination of Todd and Lance. I was just wondering what you've observed, the change in pricing and margin for the customers and business you retained on the electronic exchanges. And have you seen the anticipated pickup in volume? So I'm talking about in the U.S. business, those that have gone on to exchanges. In the past, you talked about the low oil prices driving some additional volume.","Jerre Stead","Yes, great question. Please, Lance.","Lance Uggla","Sure. Well, the electronic trade cost us less to execute and is a lower revenue for us, and it -- it's priced for the customer to be able to do more volume in an electronic market. We haven't seen huge impacts in terms of that business, but the mix of the business has shifted somewhat. We'll expect that to continue to shift, but I think the volume impact -- the revenue impact across the group is negligible.","Jerre Stead","Thank you very much. Last question.","Operator","Our last question is from Warren Gardiner with Evercore. You may begin.","Warren Gardiner","Great, thanks. Lance, I guess just for you again. Really nice rebound in organic growth for solutions this quarter. Imagine some of the industry trends for WSO helped there. But can you just kind of give us some of the puts and takes there, maybe kind of flow through that 10% organic growth?","Jerre Stead","Yeah, good question, good wrap-up question. Thank you.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So on the positive side, our managed services around WSO, as you mentioned, tax, our document exchange, these are all strong -- is the amend release. These are all strong contributors to the growth. Slower market digital where large managed service is also positive in and about double digits. ","When you get into the ones that haven't added to the growth, KYC has been slow, slow for implementation, slow to establish, the utility as a single source of use across the industry. When I probably spoke to you last, there were three platforms. Now there's two. And so that put some improving thoughts in place in terms of the future, but it has been slow and much slower than we would have liked. ","Our KY3P, which is the vendor managed service, that's up and running now with good customer statistics, and we'll show you some of the product live and working with our customers and vendors at the Investor Day. So those are the pluses and minuses.","Jerre Stead","Thank you so much.

As a reminder, this conference call maybe recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Eric Boyer, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Eric Boyer","Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 2018 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning, we issued our Q3 earnings press release and posted supplemental materials to the IHS Markit Investor Relations website. Our discussion on the quarter based on non-GAAP measures or adjusted numbers which exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, and other times. IHS Markit believes non-GAAP results are useful in order to enhance the understanding of our ongoing operating performance. But they are a supplement to and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is a copyrighted property of IHS Markit. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS Markit is prohibited. This conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risk and uncertainties.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found on IHS Markit's filings with SEC and on the IHS Markit website. After our prepared remarks, Lance Uggla, our Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will be available to take your questions. ","With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Lance Uggla. Lance? ","Lance Uggla","Thank you, Eric. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Markit Q3 earnings call. Today we'll talk about our strong Q3 results, operational initiatives for sustained growth and profitability, an update on the Ipreo integration and our decision to keep our MarkitSERV business. ","We had a strong quarter of financial results. The key highlights of the quarter were, revenue of $1.001 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 7% on an organic basis excluding the impact from the prior year biennial BPVC revenue. We continued to deliver broad-based growth across the firm. ","Adjusted EBITDA of $391 million, up 11% over the prior year, and margin of 39%. Normalized margin expansion was 60 basis points excluding the impact of FX and Ipreo as we continue to streamline our operations and benefit from the natural leverage of the model while continuing to invest for long-term profitable growth. And finally, adjusted EPS of $0.58. ","Let me now provide some highlights. I'll start with Transportation which delivered strong diversified organic revenue growth of 9% in the quarter. Growth was driven broadly by the same trends we've been seeing throughout the year. Within automotive, we continue to see strong growth from both our new and used auto businesses and are benefiting from deepening our penetration of existing customers and continued product innovation. As expected, our recall business moderated to a normalized level in the third quarter. ","Financial Services reported 8% organic growth with broad-based strength. Top performers included pricing indices, valuation services, reg and compliance, analytics, enterprise data management and the MarkitSERV derivatives processing. ","CMS organic revenue growth was 4% excluding the impact of BPVC, as we continue to benefit from improving end markets and operational changes within our product design, ECR and TMT businesses. ","Resources organic revenue growth was 5% as our upstream energy business continues to improve and our mid and downstream businesses remain strong. We are particularly pleased to see continued improvement in Resources recurring revenue. We expect the price of oil to end the year higher than the industry originally thought. And we expect the level of CapEx spending to improve in 2019. But on the whole, our customers remained somewhat cautious with spending. ","On the operational side, coming out of our product deep dive sessions this summer, I'm particularly pleased with the sense of continued urgency and the high level of commercial engagement across the firm. I can report that we are making progress on a number of fronts, which I'll outline. ","First, an increased focus on being even closer to our customers, a higher level of customer engagement from the top is cascading throughout the organization and helps us better partner with our customers, and provides critical insights that fuel product innovation. ","Second, our teams are focused on streamlining all internal processes to increase the profitability and to self-fund future growth initiatives. We're using technology to further automate and to increase efficiency in how we create our information and solutions. We are also more effectively utilizing remote intelligence to tap into best cost pools of talent around the world. ","Third, we have increased targeted investment in product development across our business lines which will seed sustained future growth in the years to come. Let me provide a couple of examples. As we talked about on the Q2 call, we are increasing the level of investments within our upstream business as the industry is starting to spend again, especially on analytical offerings. Within automotive, we are making investments in our CARFAX for Life initiative, our automotiveMastermind led Conquest solution and our cross-automotive dealer network planning solution. ","Within Financial Services, we continue to make investments in data and indices, valuations respect to the private capital markets and hosted data management. ","And finally, we are seeing continued momentum with merger revenue synergies and remain on target to achieve a run-rate of $35 million exiting the year. We are especially pleased with the broad-based distribution of the industry offerings being sold into our Financial Services customers, and we are equally gaining traction selling our EDM solution into our energy market customers. ","Overall, we are very pleased with the operational execution of our teams and a really great job by all of them. ","On the M&A upfront. In terms of capital allocation, we closed the acquisition of Ipreo on August 2nd, and we are very pleased with the early days of the integration. We\u2019re able to do a lot of groundwork ahead of the closing. And we\u2019re now well on our way to the previously communicated financial targets, including 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, run rate cost synergies of $20 million by the end of \u201819, and revenue synergies of $35 million by the end of 2021. Teams are working together extremely well and with a lot of excitement around what we can achieve. Customer response continues to be very positive and we\u2019ve already seen some early revenue synergy momentum, particularly in our loans and private capital markets businesses.","Now relative to MarkitSERV. We\u2019ve decided the best financial and strategic outcome for IHS Markit at this time is to keep our MarkitSERV business. We completed a disciplined and comprehensive sales process with both strategic and private equity parties and could not reach agreement at a sufficient value for the asset with an ongoing acceptable commercial relationship. MarkitSERV has an integral part to play in the post trade industry consolidation that we expect to occur in the coming years and continues to be a valued strategic partner across the whole financial markets. We look forward to continuing to invest and build this business and we\u2019ll take the lead in innovating and looking for opportunities to partner with industry and our customers. ","You can continue to expect IHS Markit\u2019s longer term organic revenue profile, including Ipreo and MarkitSERV to be as previously stated, 5% to 7% organic growth range and our Financial Services segment to be in the mid to high-single-digits. This organic growth profile, along with our commitment for a 100 basis points in annual margin expansion and our 500 million annual share buyback target will generate solid double-digit adjusted earnings growth and $1 billion plus of free cash flow annually. We are very comfortable with this financial profile. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Todd.","Todd Hyatt","Thank you, Lance. Before we get started, as Lance said, we closed Ipreo on August 2nd. And as a result, our Q3 results include a one-month stub period for Ipreo, which contributed in line with our expectations with approximately $25 million of revenue and $6 million of adjusted EBITDA. ","Relative to Q3, we were pleased with the continuation of positive revenue and profit trends from the first half of the year. Our Q3 organic revenue growth was 7% normalized for the BPVC impact and included stable recurring organic growth of 7% and normalized non-recurring organic growth of 6%. ","Looking at segment performance. Transportation revenue growth was 16%, including 9% organic and 7% acquisitive. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 10% recurring and 6% non-recurring. As expected, our non-recurring growth was lower than prior quarter as our recall business did moderate to a more normalized level. ","Resources revenue growth was 5% and organic revenue growth was also 5%. Organic revenue growth was comprised of 4% recurring and 8% non-recurring. Recurring organic growth was led by our chemicals, PGCR and downstream pricing businesses. Upstream revenue increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. Our Q3 annual contract value across the entire Resources segment including OPIS was $726 million which was up $17 million versus beginning of year ACV. We continue to track in line with our low to mid-single-digit ACV growth expectation for the year.","Non-recurring revenue growth remained strong due to improved consulting and software performance. Normalized CMS organic revenue growth excluding prior year BPVC was 4%, including recurring organic of 3% and normalized non-recurring organic of 13%.","Financial Services revenue growth was 16%, including 8% organic and 8% acquisitive. Information organic growth was 6% with strong performance across the indices, pricing and valuation services. Processing organic growth was 5% led by our derivatives processing of 7% and loan processing of 3%.","Solutions organic revenue growth was 12% led by analytics, regulatory and compliance solutions and continued growth in our WSO loan management and enterprise data management offerings. We expect Financial Services organic growth to moderate in Q4 with continued strength and information and solutions offset by a challenging year-over-year comparison in our processing business.","Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA was $391 million, including a $6 million contribution from Ipreo. Adjusted EBITDA growth was 11% versus prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, up 25 basis points on a reported basis and up 60 basis points normalized for FX and Ipreo. ","Regarding segment profitability, Transportation\u2019s adjusted EBITDA was $128 million with margin of 43.1%, an increase of 30 basis points. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA was $156 million with a margin of 44%, a decrease of 100 basis points. Excluding Ipreo, Financial Services adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.4%, an increase of 40 basis points. ","Resources adjusted EBITDA was $85 million which was $3 million lower than prior year due to continued investment in the segment. ","CMS adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, down $2 million versus prior year with a margin of 22% due to higher royalty expense. Adjusted EPS was $0.58 per diluted share, up 2% versus prior year. Prior year adjusted EPS benefited by $0.07 from a favorable tax benefit. ","Our adjusted EPS includes an adjusted tax rate of 19% in line with our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 18% to 20%. Our GAAP tax rate was 7%. ","On a full year basis, we expect a negative GAAP tax rate due primarily to the estimated $136 million net benefit from one-time items associated with US tax reform which were recorded in Q1. ","Q3 free cash flow was $293 million. Our trailing 12 month free cash flow improved to $938 million and represented a conversion rate of 62%. Excluding acquisition-related costs, conversion was 68%. We continue to see solid trends in our cash conversion. ","Our quarter-end debt balance was $6.06 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times on a bank covenant basis and we closed the quarter with a $154 million of cash. ","As discussed on the Ipreo acquisition call, on a business as usual basis, we expect to delever below 3 times by Q3 2019. In the quarter, we completed $1.25 billion of public debt financing, including $750 million of 10-year bonds at a 4.75% coupon rate, and $500 million of 5-year bonds at 4.125% coupon rate. Our quarter-end fixed debt as a percent of total debt is 61%. The fixed debt portion of our capital structure will increase as we delever and leverage moves back to our target leverage range. ","Our Q3 weighted average diluted share count was 405 million shares. We've suspended our share buyback until we return to our target leverage range of 2 to 3 times. Year-to-date, we have executed $758 million of share repurchases and have repurchased 16 million shares at an average price of $47.34. ","Regarding acquisitions, AMM continues to perform well with current year growth of 40% that has delivered lower than our original plan due in part to a delay of Conquest which we'll now launch in Q4. Because of this, we expect AMM financials to lag behind original plan. As a result, in Q3, we've reduced the estimate for AMM acquisition-related performance-based compensation for the future purchase price of the remaining 22% interest in AMM. This is a forward-based calculation that can be adjusted up or down based on actual or future performance. ","In terms of guidance, we are updating our prior ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect tightening of the ranges with modest increase to high-end of prior ranges and also to include Ipreo for the four month stub period. We are also updating adjusted EPS to the mid to high-end of prior range due to overperformance of adjusted EBITDA offset by slight dilution from Ipreo. ","The guidance provides for: ","Revenue of $4 billion to $4.2 billion, including organic growth of 6%; $30 million revenue benefit from FX and a $100 million to $110 million from Ipreo. We also expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion, including $25 million to $30 million from Ipreo. Margin will be negatively impacted by approximately 30 basis points from FX and 40 basis points from Ipreo. And we expect adjusted EPS of $2.25 to $2.27. We will provide 2019 guidance in November and expect to guide in line with our longer term financial commitments. ","We continue to deliver solid financial results and are focused on delivering the shareholder commitments we made at the beginning of the year while continuing to invest in the business to drive long-term growth. ","And with that, I will turn the call back over to Lance. ","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. We continue to execute very well, accomplished a lot in the quarter and have set ourselves up to deliver a very strong year of financial results. We look forward to broaden you our 2019 outlook early in November.","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Meuler","Just maybe a little bit more on MarkitSERV, because I think where you left us it sounded like there was a pretty robust process going on and it sounded maybe there\u2019s more than just the price of the transaction. So could you just maybe go into more detail, I think there was a comment about like [reaching][ph] some sort of commercial relationship after closing the transaction. So I guess what part of MarkitSERV did you kind of need to continue to drive data from or whatever that comment was? And then to the extent to which that Markit maybe consolidating, I heard that you are going to continue to invest but if you\u2019re not going to be a seller at this time, does that mean that you\u2019re likely to be an acquirer in that space?","Lance Uggla","Okay. Those are -- that\u2019s a good broad question. So I\u2019ll give it -- I\u2019ll try to hit all those points. So first off, I think in putting MarkitSERV up for sale, our belief is that the post trade derivatives processing arena should be consolidated. And there\u2019s three or four strategic assets in the marketplace globally and we saw an opportunity for either private capital or one of the strategic to take the lead to do that consolidation. And we thought that in that we could sell MarkitSERV at a sufficient value level to participate properly in that consolidation. ","We didn\u2019t find that strategic buyer or the private equity buyer that asked the value proposition that we wanted for our asset to minimize any dilution would be -- was possible to reach. And so, we thought about it in a very disciplined way and felt that the best way -- and even in the quarter, we had a 7% derivatives processing growth. So giving us more belief that our asset was at the kind of baseline after many years of declining revenues, we felt that we\u2019re at a baseline and the asset value should represent both participation in a consolidation and to a fair value for the EBITDA that the asset generates. ","So in not achieving that, we decided to keep the asset. And therefore, what does that mean going forward? We don\u2019t see ourselves being highly acquisitive within derivatives processing. But we do think we made a loud statement to the marketplace that there\u2019s opportunities for the strategic consolidation of certain assets. And if some of the strategic market participants wish to discuss or participate in those types of activities, we\u2019re going to be open to do that. But we\u2019re also quite open to manage the asset. We\u2019re a key strategic market participant. We have valued customer relationships and we\u2019re -- we\u2019ll be in a good position to continue to offer the services we do. ","The last piece was the commercial arrangements. Within the Financial Services structure of IHS Markit, we do have some analytic products around FRTB for one where the MarkitSERV product offering and our FRTB analytic offering come together where customers see that can better allow them to model out their risk factors to support those risk calculations. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Peter Appert","Thanks. Good morning, Lance. Just sticking on MarkitSERV for a sec. Given you won't get the liquidity associated with selling and I'm wondering how this impacts the timing of a resumption of buybacks. I'm thinking that maybe we will not be able to get to the $500 million next year? And then related to that should we assume that the appetite for M&A is diminished here on the near-term basis, again in the context with leverage?","Lance Uggla","Okay, so I'll talk and I'll hand it to Todd just in terms of the leverage numbers. Clearly at 3.5 times lever we need to delever first. I believe, Todd said that our delevering back into the 2 to 3 times range can happen in Q3. And our goal, once we delever is that we will on an annual basis buy back 500 million approximately of our stock each year.","In terms of M&A, I think that we\u2019ve spent a lot of time for two years on less M&A and more organic growth. And I think that we found a good balance and pace within the firm. I think the organic numbers support our forward growth path regardless of M&A activities. But once we delever, we get back to our capital plans in terms of buybacks, we will look at bolt-on acquisitions as we were doing before. Todd you want to add?","Todd Hyatt","So you know, Peter, we continue to drive good strong cash. We're confident in the ability to get below the 3 times into our target leverage range by Q3 of next year. We'll provide the specific 2019 guidance in November. But I think there's a path to get toward the $500 million buyback in 2019, but certainly it will be very back-end loaded. ","Lance Uggla","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone.","Lance Uggla","Hi, Bill.","Bill Warmington","So a question on automotiveMastermind. You mentioned that the -- you weren't going to be paying out the -- or even had a different level of the earnout for the coming year. I wanted to ask if there'd been -- what was going on there if there had been a change in the fundamentals there. I mean, clearly, it's still highly accretive to the overall company organic revenue growth. But just wanted to ask what had changed in that?","Lance Uggla","That's a good question. So as Todd said, we've grown the asset, in terms of its top-line growth 40% year-over-year, so we're happy with the growth of the asset but within the acquisition, and it happens a lot when we're acquiring an asset from an entrepreneur in order to complete that process, we put in a performance related piece. In this case it's 22% of the purchase. That piece of the transaction of course can move up or down based on the actual performance of the asset. So based on where we are after one year, we made an adjustment to the tag-end performance-based compensation. And that could either go up or down on a forward basis and we've -- Todd outlined that. ","In terms of how the Group is performing? I have to say we're extremely pleased in terms of how automotiveMastermind fits into our automotive franchise and helps us drive our forward high-single-digit growth. What we've said before is, is being on the dealer floor coupled with our Polk registration data, our CARFAX franchise and our digital marketing franchise around building of audiences, we need a presence on the dealer floor and the reason to acquire this asset and pay what we did for the asset is to ensure our presence on the dealer floor, that's been established. ","The piece that didn't perform as well as we wanted is there is two parts of the Mastermind forward-looking revenues. One piece is around retention of the customer and one piece is around Conquest. When we started looking at the platforms on a go forward basis, originally, we felt about building a new Conquest platform separate from the Mastermind's retention platform. But after doing our analysis, we felt that it was much better to build the two together. And therefore, we put a delay into the release of Conquest. But we feel it's much better for the dealer franchises to both have the retention model and the Conquest model built into a single database and a single service. So we pushed ourselves into a 12-month delay, that's reflected into the numbers. But nothing has changed in terms of corporate view on the fit of the asset and the go-forward performance within our automotive franchise. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open ","Tim McHugh","Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the spending in the Resources segment and the margin drag there? I know you talked about some incremental investments. I guess how long does that period of increased investment is likely need to continue I guess as growth improves here? And what's the outlook in general I guess for the Resources margin as we think forward for the next year or two?","Lance Uggla","Yes, I guess the way we look at all of our -- well the whole firm as well as the individual segments, the whole firm we told you go forward 5% to 7% organic growth, up from 4% to 6% with the Ipreo acquisition. We talked about and reconfirmed regularly the 100 basis points of margin. And we tell that we're going to drive double-digit earnings growth. So that's how we're managing the firm and that's what your expectations of us should be. ","Within the merger of IHS and Markit, we said that we were going to use our ability to drive operational efficiencies to give you the 100 basis points and anything incremental we could across that firm we wanted to -- across the firm we wanted to reinvest. Within Resources, we've seen significant opportunity in the upstream part of our business to invest in analytics, data analytics, our software offerings. We've seen some great growth year-over-year within our software offerings within our upstream energy businesses. And so the timing of that particular reporting of financial numbers to me personally it's a timing issue. I don't see anything changing in terms of our margin expansion or our growth plans into the low moving to mid-single-digits in the energy section.","So yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to call out on that, except that those investments show up on a year-over-year basis. ","Todd Hyatt","The other one I would call out is some investment in the downstream pricing as we add additional \u2026","Lance Uggla","Into OPIS, yes. ","Todd Hyatt","Into OPIS as we add additional spot market pricing. But energy is, I would say, of all of the segments, it has certainly the highest level of operating leverage. And it\u2019s an area that certainly moving forward on a long-term basis, we would expect to have opportunity to expand margin in energy. But this is the right time to put a little bit more money back into the business.","Lance Uggla","No, great. I have to say that the team Dave and Brian working with Jonathan, Atul, Dan and they really have done a great job. We\u2019ve got ourselves back first quarter in mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and that\u2019s a real positive. So hats off to them, and I think they\u2019re right on track. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.","Manav Patnaik","Maybe you can touch on the auto business a little bit. So I guess longer term, I mean despite slowdown by automotiveMastermind in all, I guess we\u2019re still in the same range, with the same drivers. I was just wondering if you guys hash out that outlook a little bit more?","Lance Uggla","Right. Yes, I think, automotive division is doing exactly what we said it would do, which is high-single-digits. Occasionally, we\u2019ve been above that. But if I look at all of the components, if you take CARFAX, CARPROOF, you take automotiveMastermind, you take our digital marketing, our automotive forecasting, our VPaC, and our Polk, our registration franchise and the audience building, all of those are -- have strong fundamentals and are well supported to deliver a forward high-single-digit growth. ","In this quarter, we\u2019d called out that recall we I think recalled previously that it would moderate, it did, that probably pulled us more back into that high-single-digits rather than slightly over that. But there\u2019s nothing within automotive in terms of the forward-looking franchise that doesn\u2019t support a combined high-single-digit organic growth. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying, we continue to expect that. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Lance, I think you mentioned that you still see a little bit of reluctance perhaps by some of your upstream customers to spend or just generally had the convos on Resources' CapEx. Can you conjecture a little bit on what you think changes the demand environment? Is it a sustained higher price of oil? Is there something structural in the market? When do we get back to maybe a period of sustained higher CapEx in the Resources segment?","Lance Uggla","Right. Well, I think, one thing that I would say in speaking to our energy customers is that I don\u2019t think any of them are returning to the previous days in terms of the amount of CapEx and the spending levels that existed. There\u2019s just a much more cautious and certain approach to how the energy companies are spending money on a forward basis. But higher oil prices support a CapEx spending level that you can see drifting upwards. And we do see increases in CapEx as we look forward. But I guess when you look at the current oil price, we see a whole bunch of market-based factors that are creating some uncertainty in terms of where the oil price is. You've got the Iran sanctions, you've got Permian supply challenges that are capping what can come out of the Permian at the moment. You've got a cartel that\u2019s holding together very strongly in spite of the President's call for some lightening up in terms of supply distribution. And Venezuela, you got a whole bunch of it. And still when we look at our forecast, we look at 3% global GDP growth, and that also supports a continued strong demand. So, therefore, when you add all those things up, we're seeing a market with energy -- oil prices much higher than what we had forecast or the market had thought, but I still think the energy producers will remain cautious and will still be looking at their CapEx based off of much lower energy price. And -- but I think it bodes well for IHS Markit. It just means that projects that are looked at are certain when they start, they're going to have long-term needs from us for support. They are global. We're participating in offshore Africa and Brazil. We're very active in the Permian. North Sea is active again. So I feel our position is very well supported in terms of our mid-single-digit growth in terms of our upstream business that will be supported going forward and don't see any reason to put any risk parameters on that scenario, as we've laid out to the marketplace. But there is cautious, I think that's going to stay and there is an energy price -- oil price at the moment that based on all the market conditions I laid out is -- continues to drift higher. But that's not where we see the energy price in 12 to 24 months time, we'd see it lower.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","George Tong","I'd like to dive a bit deeper into your margin outlook. Your EBITDA margins expanded 50 bps in the quarter normalized for FX and Ipreo, where you had discussed plans for elevated investment activity in your various segments. Can you elaborate on the timing and quantification of your various investments? And the potential sources of upside or downside, outside of your investment activities, your targeted 150 bps of annual margin expansion over the near-term?","Todd Hyatt","George, I mean we're always balancing a level of investment in the business and delivery of financial commitments. We're driving good growth. We're driving a good level of profit flow through in that growth and we're also making an appropriate level of investment in the company. And if we look on a year-to-date basis normalized, we've delivered above the 100 point target for the year. And we're doing that as we're also delivering better revenue and better overall total profit growth. So we're comfortable with how the business is performing and how we're managing delivery of profit to shareholders at the same time while we're making forward investment decisions. There isn't going to be a large or lumpy item that's going to significantly change the trajectory certainly that I foresee. And you should just continue to expect more of the same. ","Lance Uggla","Thanks, Todd. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari","Hey, good morning. My question is just mostly focused on what you're seeing regionally specifically in Europe. It seems like there has been a little bit of a slowdown there. And then any updated view on China tariffs. How that impacts your business indirectly I guess? Thank you. ","Lance Uggla","So I just came back from Asia and I have to say reading the press and reading all the rhetoric with respect to the tariffs you'd expect to feel Asia that from the markets that we're in wouldn't be that excited -- but exciting. But I have to say I felt the exact opposite. I attended the Temasek Singapore Summit. There was lots of enthusiasm for business and opportunity, but there was also a lot of talk about the general geopolitics and the impact of tariffs and a lot of discussion. I think for a company like ourselves that's information and services base has a small consulting angle to it, I think that we bring a light on markets to help people make decisions in many different environments and sometimes the market that's got some turmoil to it requires more support from experts. And IHS Markit we have 1,700 research analysts out of our 14,000, 15,000 people globally that are very specialized in a variety of market activities across energy, transportation, aerospace and defense, technology, financial markets. And if anything we see strong double-digit growth in Asia throughout this year. We expect that to continue into next year. We see that we're able to operate at 1.5 to 2 times GDP in Europe in terms of our growth and similarly in the US. And that's driving an overall mid to upper single-digit organic growth for the company. And I don't see impact of tariffs changing our growth on a forward basis. ","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. I wanted to talk kind of a big picture strategy question. Now that you've completed the Ipreo acquisition decided to hold on to MarkitSERV, would it be correct to say that the Financial Services segment is probably going to continue to be the biggest part of your portfolio and an area that you're going to focus on the most?","Lance Uggla","Not at all. I think that our focus is on the activities we do as a company. So we're highly focused on seeing the -- on participating in the forward growth dynamics of the energy market as it continues to recover. And we feel we're very well leveraged there to the upside. Automotive has consistently been driving our transportation, high-single-digits growth, our investments back into ADS and maritime and trade are supporting a continued upside into those high-single-digits and we see that continuing. And high-single-digit growth in automotive, if that continues for the next two or three years, you could easily see it pass financial markets in terms of size. And so, I think the thought that because I come from financial markets background, that\u2019s going to be the place we focus, that\u2019s not the case. ","We want to focus in all our segments and drive consistent growth as we\u2019ve described it, high-single-digits in Transportation, mid to high now with Ipreo in financial markets, mid in -- on a forward basis in Resources and low to mid in our CMS division. And so, that\u2019s our focus. And as we do that and we focus on our costs, we focus on our customers, we focus on our people, we increasingly feel confident in delivering that 5% to 7%, the 100 basis points and we see that mix being something that diversifies us in a different way than our peers set that are a bit more narrowly focused. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Your stock comp guidance is up a little bit from the prior guide. And I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because of Ipreo being included now. Could reduce remind us of your longer term strategy or philosophy around stock comp. I just wanted to see if it\u2019s the same as sort of the way Jerre was thinking about it. And anything you can add there would be helpful?","Todd Hyatt","Yes. So we are seeing stock comp come down post merger, right? So it was 2.62 last year and we\u2019re going to see that number come down, so we are making progress. Certainly coming out of the merger, we had an elevated level of stock-based comp expense. The target that we\u2019ve provided at the time of the merger was the 1.25% of outstanding shares in year one. We took that down to 1% for 2018 in terms of stock comp shares that would be issued. And we\u2019ll expect to stay in line with that target and look for opportunities to improve that target as we move forward. But it\u2019s basically the 1% of outstanding shares.","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Thanks, Toni. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi ","So you had pretty good performance across the board here. I wondered if you could help us understand which vertical you think is seeing the strongest improvement in the demand backdrop? And then maybe just update us on the Ipreo integration and any regulation concerns there? Thanks.","Lance Uggla","Okay. So in terms of -- well, it\u2019s interesting because automotive or Transportation and Financial Services clearly seeing 8%, 9% organic growth are definitely as I would see them, they\u2019re just very well diversified across the markets they operate in. And are getting a set of diversified upside that\u2019s supporting that high-single-digit growth in both of those segments. So it'd be easy to think that that those were the divisions that were performing the best. ","I have to say that if I look at Resources and since the date of -- two years since merger and another six or eight months ahead of that as we got everything lined up, looking at Resources and seeing it come from where it was negative organic growth back to 5% organic growth, I'd say that that division within the IHS Markit has the best single leverage to the upside. It's got pretty much every customer in the space. It has C-suite access, it has thought leadership around CERAWeek. And Dan Yergin and his team, it has the leading position in chemicals. OPIS, a leading player in the downstream pricing and news for gas, for coal, for chemicals, we\u2019re competing square on with the Argus and Platts, great single-digit growth. We've got a growing PGCR franchise that's well positioned. So when I look at Resources, I go well we're well positioned. And that 5% is a substantive achievement by the team. And I think there's continued upside. ","When I then go to CMS, it's interesting CMS, we got three businesses and CMS. One we provide economic and country risk. In a world with geopolitics and tariffs and all sorts of tensions, providing economic and country risk forecasts, I think is a good position, and that should bode for mid-single-digit growth, or low to mid-single-digits. Our TMT business under Ian Weightman, it\u2019s world class, the things we do are outstanding. And if you compare us there to other technology benchmarking and providers, you should expect mid to upper single-digits in terms of TMT, and Ian is bringing us back into that fold. ","And then you've got our big product design business which has been dragged a bit by increasing royalties, we do distribute for others. We don't set the royalty payments. We negotiate them and that's dragged our earnings there. But you have to think of a world with 3% GDP growth, you should expect engineering and projects around the world to be buoyant. And therefore, I think we're well positioned. So I take the CMS and I look at that as low to mid-single-digits. ","When you look at all of that, I'm proud of the performance of all the divisions. They've all done a substantive job. It's great that Transportation and Financial Services are dragging this up above mid-single-digits. But at the same time to return to mid-single-digits in energy and start to get operational leverage into our CMS division and focus, I have to say that\u2019s -- that gives us a very, very good position and bodes well going forward, as well as we do believe that with technology efficiencies and opportunity for best cost, we can continue to give you a 100 basis points each year until we get into the mid 40s.","Next question? ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open","Michael Cho","This is Michael Cho for Andrew this morning, good morning. ","Lance Uggla","Hi, Michael. ","Michael Cho","Hi. I just want to touch on the Resources segment one more time. Based upon the ACV trends earlier, I was wondering what's the third quarter Resources ACV trends were year-over-year on a constant currency basis including OPIS? And there were some comments around the expectation of higher CapEx spend by oil companies. I mean is that CapEx spend you're expecting driven by oil companies expanding into new geographies?","Lance Uggla","Yes. Do you want me to do the CapEx and you do the? The CapEx that I focused on is that it's cautious, the CapEx. But we expect continued improvements or increases in CapEx. And that's based on energy companies spending more year-over-year with respect to CapEx, which is supported by the higher energy prices. But we expect them to be cautious and careful in the allocation of those dollars. So we don't just put a trend line with the energy price and CapEx spending in a way that we'd see substantive increases in CapEx. We think they will all remain cautious and they feel that there is a lot of geopolitical factors hanging over the high energy price that we're seeing at the moment. ","Todd, do you want to do the ACV?","Todd Hyatt","Yes, Eric will keep me honest here. But I believe that the first half year-to-date ACV was up $5 million or $6 million. So the Q3 was up $12 million. And if you look at the context for that $12 million and in terms of renewal base that would have been available to renew in the quarter, probably a $175 million. So a pretty good quarter when we look at the performance of the ACV growth. ","Lance Uggla","Thanks Todd. Next question?","Operator","And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines, sir. ","Lance Uggla","Good. Well at that note, we'll wrap it up. I just want to say thank you once again to all the teams globally not just the businesses but all the shared services that support us and the great work that they're doing. And to our analysts and investors, thank you for your support.
