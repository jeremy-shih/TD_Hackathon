Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call.","Carol Schumacher ","Hi, this is Carol Schumacher, vice president of investor relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Our press release and transcript of this call are available on our website; that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com.","Here\u2019s today\u2019s agenda. Mike Duke, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the quarter and the challenging retail environment we face in all of our markets. Jeff Davis, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial results.","Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments. First up, Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. Bill will be followed by Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International, and then we\u2019ll complete our operating segment discussion with Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club.","Given the level of e-commerce activity in many areas of the company, we\u2019ve invited Neil Ashe, president and CEO of Global eCommerce, to join us today for a progress report on our strategies to integrate e-commerce sales within our stores. Neil will follow the operating segment reports. Then, Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with an analysis of our financial priorities, as well as EPS guidance for the third quarter and the full year.","We continue to receive questions from you about our comp sales reporting calendar for this fiscal year for our U.S. operating segments. This fiscal year, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. As a reminder, our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. Our Q4 reporting period begins Oct. 26 and runs through Jan. 31. Therefore, week 53 will be compared to week one of the current fiscal year 2014.","Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate are available on our website. Please note that year to date, we no longer have discontinued operations. But, we do have one term we\u2019d like to remind you about. We started with this term last quarter. \u201cCorporate and support\u201d is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as Global eCommerce support and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as \u201cother unallocated.\u201d","Our annual analyst meeting is Tuesday, October 15 in Northwest Arkansas. Registration is open, and we invite you to join us for a full day of presentations and updates on our global business. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website, again, that\u2019s www.stock.walmart.com, if you can\u2019t join us in person.","We have a lot to cover today. Mike will start us off with the highlights and a report card on our business at the halfway mark of the year.","Mike?","Mike Duke ","Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.","Today, we reported a 5.1 percent increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.24 for the second quarter, which is within our guidance. Sales for the quarter were below expectations, but improved from the first quarter. We are executing plans to strengthen our top line performance for the rest of the year and expect sequential improvement in the back half.","We\u2019re pleased that Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club leveraged expenses for the first half of the year. But, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses in the second quarter as a company. While it will be difficult, we believe the steps we\u2019re taking to control costs, especially in International, will bring us closer to our full-year leverage goal. We will continue to invest in leverage initiatives, compliance and e-commerce as we focus on future growth.","So, let\u2019s take a closer look at how our businesses performed in the second quarter. Consolidated net sales and our Walmart U.S. comp were below expectations for the quarter. While the retail environment was challenging across all of our markets, the Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club businesses improved comp sales from the first quarter, and reported sales in International remained consistent. We expect to see improvement in all of our segments in the back half of the year.","Walmart U.S. comp sales declined 0.3 percent in the 13-week period ended July 26. Traffic improved from the first quarter, and we gained market share in key categories. We continue to invest in price and we are focused on delivering positive comps during the next two quarters.","Sam\u2019s Club comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.7 percent for the 13-week period. The improved merchandise assortment and Instant Savings program drove membership growth. Business member traffic also improved. I\u2019m pleased that Sam\u2019s new membership enhancements and fee structure contributed to bottom line improvement.","Walmart International\u2019s constant currency net sales were up 4.4 percent. Operating income was substantially better in the second quarter than our first quarter, and increased 40 basis points year-over-year. We achieved expense reduction in some countries, but as we said in the first quarter on our earnings call, we didn\u2019t leverage expenses this quarter given that sales were below expectations.","In February, I outlined six key areas that are critical to Walmart\u2019s long-term success. So, let\u2019s look at our report card at the halfway mark this year. First, I said we need to deliver a strong Walmart U.S. business. The underlying business strategy is solid, but year-to-date sales were below our expectations.","Traffic trends improved throughout the second quarter as weather normalized and customers responded favorably to the improved quality in our fresh offerings, especially produce. Our apparel and home categories rebounded this quarter, delivering very good comp sales. The team\u2019s cost discipline delivered leverage and strong operating income in the first half of the year and I expect this will continue.","We\u2019re also making it more convenient for customers to access Walmart on their shopping terms. Our mobile and online technology investments increased customer engagement and drove double-digit sales growth for walmart.com. This fiscal year, we\u2019re on track to increase our Neighborhood Market fleet by more than 40 percent, reaching new markets and filling in grocery offerings around supercenters.","To improve International returns, our second key priority, we must drive expense leverage and lower our cost structure to align with a more challenging retail environment. In the first half, our sales growth was less than we expected. International\u2019s ability to leverage is important to the company\u2019s overall leverage goal and we are committed to improving through productivity and expense savings.","Effective cost management is vital to improving returns in International during this low-growth cycle, and we\u2019re taking steps to accomplish this. For example, our China and our global leverage teams partnered to launch a new productivity initiative that is yielding positive results in China. In Mexico, we\u2019re implementing an on-shelf availability application to target and improve in-stock opportunities. And across many of our markets, we\u2019re utilizing workforce management tools to better align associate schedules with customer traffic. These actions, among others, will contribute to International\u2019s leverage goal.","On our third priority, I said we must increase capital discipline. I\u2019m pleased with the stronger performance of our new stores, and a number of recent grand openings delivered sales ahead of expectations. We\u2019re making better real estate decisions and driving greater efficiency in our construction of new stores and remodels. Our real estate review meetings are focused on improving returns by reducing costs and increasing sales per square foot.","Next is our focus on leverage initiatives. Our leverage teams are partnering with the operating segments to drive greater expense savings. Increased direct import volumes are lowering cost of goods sold. These are savings that we pass along to our customers. In our stores, we\u2019re improving customer experience and reducing costs through enhancements to hybrid and self-checkout register technology. And, we just finished the migration of eight countries in Latin America to our Costa Rican Shared Services Center, which we expect to lower back office costs and improve service levels.","The fifth priority that I outlined is winning in e-commerce, and I\u2019m pleased with our progress. Sales globally grew more than 30 percent in the first two quarters, led by the strong performance from our acquisition of Yihaodian. I\u2019m confident that these are the right investments to position the business for long-term success, despite the short-term headwind that they create on financial results. We have ambitious goals, and you\u2019ll hear more from Neil shortly.","Last, I told you in February that we would continue to strengthen Walmart\u2019s compliance organization. We\u2019ve enhanced processes and procedures, associate training and organizational leadership. We now have chief compliance officers in substantially all markets and regions, and anti-corruption directors in almost all markets. Together, they are continuing to implement compliance systems, conduct regular risk assessments and increase training for our associates.","Walmart continues to focus on areas that help our customers and our associates live better. Bill and I recently visited stores in Tennessee, West Virginia and Georgia. I saw how our associates appreciated the focus on opportunity in our recent Shareholders Meeting and the programs we have in place to help them achieve their personal objectives.","When Doug and I went to stores in Brazil, Japan, Argentina and Chile, it was gratifying to see how our focus on the customer translates globally. In every market, we have the most committed associates who display a passion for helping our customers to save money and live better. I\u2019m really looking forward to visiting more of our stores again this quarter.","Before I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by our position to execute in the second half of the year, particularly with the steps we\u2019re taking to improve performance. There are areas of our business where we can do a better job, and we will. I\u2019m confident in our associates\u2019 ability to deliver for our customers with EDLP and for shareholders with improved sales and expense savings. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?","Jeff Davis ","Thank you Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 14, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $1.24 versus $1.18 last year, a 5.1 percent increase. As we told you, we expect to invest an incremental $0.09 per share in ecommerce for the full year. This investment for Q2 was approximately $0.03 per share. In addition, EPS was impacted by approximately $0.01 due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter recorded in operating expenses within Walmart International.","Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the detailed financial results for the second quarter. Consolidated net sales increased 2.4 percent or $2.7 billion, to $116.2 billion. The quarter included $216 million from acquisitions, which was offset by a negative impact of approximately $680 million from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.8 percent.","With respect to our comp sales, total U.S. comps, without fuel, were flat for the 13-week period ended July 26. You will hear more details on our separate Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club comps from Bill and Roz.","While Sam\u2019s Club delivered positive gains in membership, consolidated membership and other income decreased 4.3 percent, compared to the second quarter of last year due to Walmart U.S. and International. Total revenue was $116.9 billion, a 2.3 percent increase over last year. Our gross profit rate for Q2 was 24.8 percent, an increase of 19 basis points compared to last year.","The increase was primarily driven by our Walmart U.S. and International segments. You\u2019ll hear more from Bill and Doug on the specific drivers. Now turning to expenses, operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.5 percent, which represents a 20 basis point increase versus last year.","As always, let\u2019s take a closer look at Corporate and support expenses, which increased 31 percent and is comprised of 3 areas: Core corporate, Global eCommerce support, and Global leverage services.","Our core corporate expenses increased 12.2 percent. Expenses related to FCPA and compliance matters were approximately $82 million, which was above our forecasted range of $65 to $70 million. Approximately $48 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations. Approximately $34 million is related to global compliance programs and organizational enhancements. It is important to note that excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have decreased approximately 2.2 percent.","The remainder of Corporate and support expense growth is associated with our ongoing initiatives within global leverage services and Global eCommerce support. These expenses reflect investments for the future and remain a headwind for the remainder of the year. Neil will provide additional insights into recent developments and investments within eCommerce.","This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.4 percent to $6.8 billion. Net interest expense increased 9.5 percent to $553 million. The increase was primarily the result of a prior year release of interest accruals on tax-related matters and higher debt balances. That brings us to consolidated net income. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart was $4.1 billion, an increase of approximately 1.3 percent.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32.5 percent. As a reminder, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and a mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. A little later, Charles will provide an update for our projected tax rate for the fiscal year.","From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 5.5 percent, primarily driven by softer than expected sales within our operating segments and timing of receipts of merchandise. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding inventory levels.","Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.8 percent, which compares to 88.9 percent last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to increased levels of inventory within our Walmart U.S. and International segments and the timing of payments.","Our debt to total capitalization was 44.4 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 43.7 percent last year. Free cash flow was $5.2 billion for the six months ended July 31, 2013 compared to $6.1 billion last year. The timing of tax payments and growth of capital expenditures were the primary drivers of the decline.","Clearly one of our financial priorities is to return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Q2, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends. In addition, we repurchased approximately $1.9 billion of shares, representing approximately 24.2 million shares. This leaves us with approximately $13.9 billion remaining under our $15 billion share repurchase authorization announced in June of 2013.","Return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2013 was 17.9 percent, compared to 18.1 percent for the prior year. The reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within the base business. Now, let\u2019s move on to the discussion of our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S.","Bill?","Bill Simon","Thank you Jeff. I\u2019m proud of the great work the team did, leading us to a solid quarter in profit in a disappointing sales environment.","Net sales grew 2.1 percent to $68.7 billion, with about $1.4 billion added in sales year over year. For the quarter, we delivered a negative 0.3 percent sales comp. Traffic decreased 0.5 percent and ticket increased 0.2 percent. The lack of meaningful inflation and the 2 percent increase in payroll taxes impacted our results; however our performance reflects more than a 100 basis point improvement over Q1.","Nevertheless, I was encouraged by the improvement we saw, as traffic and comp sales increased throughout the quarter. We also saw some slight increases in inflation towards the end of the quarter. In addition, there were some key parts of the business, like produce, home and apparel, that were very successful. We\u2019ll talk about these in a bit.","We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to The Nielsen Company, we gained 14 basis points of market share in the measured category of \u201cfood, consumables and health & wellness\/OTC\u201d during the 13 weeks ending July 20th.","Year to date, we\u2019ve grown sales by $1.6 billion versus last year to $135.3 billion, leading to almost $570 million in operating income growth, and putting us at $10.9 billion in operating income for the first half of the year.","Now, let\u2019s cover additional financial details. During the quarter, we continued working with our suppliers to drive cost of goods savings. These initiatives, along with more favorable merchandise mix and logistics productivity, benefited gross profit rate.","Overall, our gross profit rate was up 23 basis points, leading to an increase of 2.9 percent in gross profit dollars. We continue to monitor the pricing environment in each market to ensure price leadership, which is the cornerstone of our business strategy.","Our stores and operations team did a great job managing expenses, delivering solid operating income growth in a challenging sales environment. Operating expenses grew by only 1.7 percent to $13.8 billion, providing 7 basis points of expense leverage. This leverage helped us deliver a strong bottom line for the quarter, with operating income growing at 5.2 percent, twice the rate of sales growth. Year to date, operating expenses were only up 0.25 percent versus last year.","Inventory was up 6.9 percent, primarily driven by softer than anticipated sales trends, the delay in summer weather and timing shifts in the receipt of merchandise for back to school and the upcoming holiday season. While we\u2019re not concerned about the quality of the inventory, it will continue to be an area of focus in the coming months, as we get ready for the key holiday season and continue to balance in-stock and an expanded assortment.","Now, let\u2019s turn to some of our savings initiatives. We continued to fuel the productivity loop in the second quarter, maintaining competitive price gaps while delivering strong profit results. Merchants, operators and our logistics team continued to work together on key leverage opportunities.","The logistics team reduced cost per case shipped year over year for the eighth consecutive quarter. Continuous improvement in trailer loading efficiency, as well as alignment and routing optimization, helped the transportation fleet produce another quarter of solid savings, with an increase of 3.7 percent in cases transported per mile driven.","Our store operations team continued to leverage technology and innovation to drive productivity across all areas of the store. The investments we\u2019ve made in self-service checkouts are increasing the flexibility of our front-end processes and at the same time reducing operating costs.","We expanded self-service checkouts across the chain, with 1,400 more lanes added during the second quarter. Our customers appreciate the added flexibility, and we experienced a 4 percent increase in the utilization rate year-over-year. We\u2019ll continue our planned installations of self-service checkouts across the country during the third quarter.","Our associates work hard to serve our customers, and we continue to emphasize the overall customer experience, even as we achieve productivity improvements within the box. I\u2019m pleased to say that, during the second quarter, customer experience scores improved versus the previous quarter.","We\u2019re also exceptionally focused on in-stock, and we\u2019re pleased that this metric continues to improve. Our goal is always to have the right product on the shelf when the customer wants it. During the second quarter, we placed additional emphasis on select, core items most relevant to our customers, and experienced in-stock improvements. Our operations management teams continue to focus on the bottom performing stores to drive better on-shelf availability. As we gear up for the back half of the year, we\u2019ll continue to monitor these key measures, maintaining a healthy balance between our expense leverage goals and customer experience.","Now let\u2019s look at the performance of our merchandise areas in more detail. I\u2019m encouraged by the strong performance in such key areas as produce, home and apparel, where our focus on quality and value fueled growth.","For the quarter, grocery sales, which includes food and consumables, grew by nearly $1 billion. We delivered delivered a slightly negative comp for the retail period. Our results were influenced by lower than anticipated inflation, even deflation in some areas, including dry grocery, frozen and snacks and beverages. Softer performance among these larger categories impacted our overall comp by more than 50 basis points. Adult beverages continued a solid trend of results, delivering a high single-digit comp.","Our produce business also continued to gain momentum, delivering a strong mid single-digit comp. We\u2019re getting more efficient at transporting the product from farm to shelf. We\u2019re executing weekly store audits and equipping associates with additional skills and tools to ensure quality and freshness.","We\u2019re also letting our customers know about it through our \u201cfresh over\u201d marketing campaign and our new \u201c100 percent money back guarantee.\u201d What\u2019s even more encouraging was that we saw consistently improving comps in produce throughout the quarter, with a high single-digit comp in July.","We also gained market share across our consumables business. However, similar to last quarter, our overall performance was somewhat soft as customers traded down, particularly in the categories where product loyalty is not the primary factor in a purchase decision.","As the quarter progressed, our seasonal categories improved, but not enough to offset the early declines. Pets delivered another quarter of low single-digit positive comps and close to 30 basis points of market share gains, for the 13 weeks ending July 20th, according to Nielsen. We expect our grocery performance to improve in the third quarter, driven by new and exclusive products and innovation.","Health and wellness reported relatively flat comps, while improving significantly versus the prior quarter. The improvement was led by our prescription business, which lapped major generic launches last year and saw an increase in overall script count. Our over-the-counter business continued its positive trend, driven by a strong assortment in active nutrition and weight control.","An area that I\u2019m particularly excited about is our diabetics offering. The team has worked diligently to provide high quality products for our customers in both over-the-counter and prescription, driving a double-digit comp in diabetics for the quarter.","Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit negative comp. When average temperatures improved in the back half of the quarter, sales picked up significantly in sporting goods, which delivered a low single-digit comp. Sales in sporting goods partly offset softer sales in other weather related categories. In our stationery and crafts department, we overlapped the re-introduction of fabrics last year.","Overall, we gained close to 60 basis points of market share in the stationery category for the three-month period ending in June, according to The NPD Group. The seasonal business also saw moderate sales growth during the quarter, driven by Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day and Fourth of July.","Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid single-digit negative comp. Our performance was pressured by soft results in both electronics and media and gaming. Mid single-digit industry deflation and softer discretionary spending continued to be significant headwinds for these categories, while the anticipation of new video game consoles caused further delays in spending for gaming.","Within electronics, we\u2019re disappointed at the performance of the TV category, as we lost market share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD. Wireless again showed sales strength, gaining over 350 basis points in unit share over an already large base, allowing us to remain the number one handset retailer in unit share for the 3 months ending June 30, according to NPD.","In toys, summer seasonal categories, including water toys and pools, improved consistently over the quarter. However, the progress was not enough to offset the declines we experienced earlier in the quarter when the weather was cooler. While warm-weather categories were challenged, the team delivered strong growth in bicycles and indoor categories.","Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp, on top of a solid comp last year. I\u2019m really proud of the team. We\u2019ve raised the quality of our offering through improved fabrics and fit and introduced quality brands, driving traffic and sales.","For the quarter, children\u2019s delivered a mid single-digit positive comp, driven by strong performance in active wear, shorts and knit tops. Men\u2019s posted a mid single-digit positive comp over a strong comp last year. The addition of brands like \u201cBen Hogan\u201d and \u201cAnd1\u201d is driving excitement and momentum in the men\u2019s department. Shoes and intimate apparel also reported strong growth. We expect the progress we\u2019ve made in our apparel business to continue through the second half of the year, as value, innovation and increased quality fuel results.","Home also reported a low single-digit positive comp. Outdoor living had a slower start, but the business quickly picked up helping us deliver a high single-digit comp. The team was ready to capitalize on the warmer weather with new and expanded brands like Snapper mowers and Weber grills. I\u2019m also pleased with our progress in live plants.","We\u2019re making great strides to ensure the freshness of our plants and our customers are noticing, evident by our double-digit positive comp during the second quarter. In indoor living, cooking and dining continued on its positive trend, driven by small electric appliances. Our bath and bedding category also improved consistently throughout the quarter, finishing the period with a low single-digit positive comp. Our relative success in the softlines business helped contribute to our favorable gross margin mix I spoke of earlier.","The back-to-school season is well under way, and we\u2019re committed to helping customers save money in time for school this year. We\u2019ll have consistently low prices all season long, both online and in stores, helping parents and students shop however they want to shop. This year, we\u2019re carrying more than 250 different school supplies for less than $1 each. Our price gap on back-to-school supplies is evident when you read various news reports that name Walmart the price leader for the season.","Now, let me now change gears and talk about the growth opportunity we have with our small formats. We continue to be excited about both the Neighborhood Markets and the Express stores, as we enter several new markets, optimize the assortment and improve the convenience.","I\u2019m particularly pleased with the performance of Neighborhood Markets. We continue to roll out this format aggressively throughout the country, opening more sites in the second quarter than in any other quarter in our history. In fact, we opened 12 stores in just one day this quarter.","The format continued on a solid trend of results, delivering more than 30 percent top line growth and consistent solid comp growth. Our comp growth was driven by strong traffic trends, as customers respond to our expanded assortment and focus on fresh foods, with produce, adult beverages and consumables setting the pace, and driving customers\u2019 intentions for return trips. What\u2019s also encouraging is that we\u2019re running these smaller stores the Walmart way, fueling the productivity loop, leveraging expenses and driving operating income growth in our comp stores.","Our Express format also delivered strong results and continued to provide important insights into small format operations. During the quarter, stores opened more than a year achieved another quarter of strong double-digit comp sales growth.","We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with our stores to create a unique shopping experience. During the quarter, we launched the locker test for site-to-store in the Washington, D.C. area. While this test is still in the early stages, the initial read on customer satisfaction and acceptance is very encouraging, with 90 percent of the customers who have used the service providing positive feedback. On the mobile front, we continued testing our \u201cScan and Go\u201d pilot, improving the experience and expanding it to Android devices.","You\u2019ve heard us talk about how our physical presence represents a significant competitive advantage for our walmart.com business. Last time we spoke, we announced the expansion of our Ship from Store program, and I\u2019m proud to say the momentum continued. A steadily increasing percentage of all items shipped to customers\u2019 homes are now fulfilled through the Ship from Store program. The majority of orders are delivered in two days or less and at a lower cost.","In the second quarter, our real estate team added 49 net new units, or 4.1 million incremental square feet, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. The new units were composed of 29 supercenters and 35 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets. Our growth over the first half of the year puts us at 7.7 million incremental square feet.","In the third quarter, we\u2019re planning to open approximately 90 units, representing 7 million additional square feet. On Memorial Day, we launched the veterans initiative and received an impressive response from the veteran community. In a little over 2 months, we hired more than 3,200 new Walmart veteran associates and continue to process applications.","Given the current economic environment, we expect our comps to be relatively flat in the coming quarter. We remain confident about the back half of the year, as we continue to execute on initiatives to drive our business, and in particular, our top line. The customer remains challenged, but I\u2019m confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. Our strategy is sound, our pricing position is solid and our ability to leverage is strong, all of which bodes well as our comps continue to improve.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for an International update. Doug","Doug McMillon ","Thanks Bill. Across our International markets, growth in consumer spending is under pressure. During the first half of the year, we saw consumers in both mature and emerging markets curb their spending, and we believe these trends will persist through the remainder of the year.","While this creates a challenging sales environment, we are the best equipped retailer to address the needs of our customers and help them save money. We clearly have plenty of opportunities to drive further improvement going forward, though we have made improvements in some markets.","We\u2019re focused on three key areas: First, as we focus on growth, we are delivering price leadership. We track the savings we offer customers on a basket of goods across our markets and invest where necessary to ensure value for them. We continue to move toward more of an EDLP approach across the entire division, because this is the most effective way to deliver value to our customers. Delivering on our core merchandising and pricing strengths is foundational.","In addition to that foundation, we are expanding our capabilities to serve customers through e-commerce, home delivery and relevant store formats. Driving sales growth, regardless of the market environment, is a top priority.","Second, we\u2019re focused on driving the productivity loop. The work we started over a year ago to transfer our best operational practices into several of our key markets is helping us. The softer than expected sales growth and wage inflation in some markets masked the improvements we\u2019ve made operationally, but I\u2019m thankful we\u2019ve made them, or our expense position would be more difficult. We need to continue down this path and improve sales to show the benefits more clearly.","As Mike mentioned earlier, our leadership teams in International are collaborating with our Global Business Process team to improve productivity through a focus on process. I\u2019ll give you some specific examples in a few minutes that show you how we are getting stronger at the basics. It\u2019s obvious that we should spread our best operational practices to situations where it makes sense, and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re finally learning how to do that more effectively. I believe this is an important part of our future and, ultimately, a key lever for us to improve returns in this division.","And third, we\u2019re focused on efficient use of capital. We\u2019re investing significant time and energy into our new store program to make sure that each approved project delivers against our forecast and that we use our capital dollars efficiently as the buildings are designed and constructed. We\u2019re finding new approaches to lighting and refrigeration, for example, that help us create stronger returns and reduce the impact on the environment. In addition, inventory management is a priority. I\u2019ll cover the numbers in just a second, but given our softness in sales, you\u2019ll see that many of our markets have reacted fairly well.","Net sales grew 2.9 percent over last year to $33.0 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales were $33.4 billion, up 4.4 percent as currency exchange rates negatively impacted reported sales by $680 million in the quarter. Acquisitions added $216 million.","Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, rose 29 basis points, and on a constant currency basis, increased 44 basis points. This was driven by rate improvements on a constant currency basis in Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., and Africa. We will cover some of the drivers of this change later in the country highlights.","Operating income declined 1.3 percent on a reported basis and improved 40 basis points compared to last year on a constant currency basis. As Jeff mentioned, these results were impacted due to a charge for a certain non-income tax matter of $52 million on a reported basis. Without this charge, our operating income results for the quarter would have been up 2.2 percent on a reported basis and 3.9 percent on constant currency basis.","As expected, operating expenses grew faster than sales. Expenses deleveraged by 40 basis points on a reported basis and 54 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results include the charge for a certain non-income tax matter mentioned previously. Without this charge, International operating expenses deleveraged by 24 basis points on a reported basis and by 38 basis points on a constant currency basis.","While operating expenses grew, these results don\u2019t tell the whole story. The Asia region leveraged expenses during the quarter, along with Chile, Central America and Africa. Mexico also achieved substantial savings in key areas, but it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the weaker than expected sales.","Like the first quarter, several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses -- weaker sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes, and strategic investments, including e-commerce. In many of our International markets, labor laws and employment contracts mean it takes more time and is more complicated to introduce and implement productivity improvements that can help us adjust labor costs to sales trends. While our core expense story has improved, we expect third quarter expenses to be under pressure, also due to the same factors I just mentioned.","We are working hard to leverage expenses in the back half of the year, and our Global Business Processes team is part of the answer to our expense challenge as we drive productivity in key markets. The China team\u2019s efforts resulted in productivity gains, enabling us to reduce store labor hours by 12.4 percent during the second quarter. Those improvements helped us offset wage growth of 11.2 percent over the same period, driven mainly by China\u2019s wage inflation.","This, in a nutshell, serves as an example of what we have to get done across most of our markets. Beyond China, the Global On-Shelf Availability application is being rolled out in Mexico, improving in-stock and the ability to target and address issues with product availability for the customer. And finally, Brazil is rolling out best practices in fresh operations, ordering, and inventory flow to reduce throwaways and improve quality for the customer.","We also are rolling out the workforce management system across many of our markets to better match work shift needs and personal schedules. Inventory grew 3.7 percent on a reported basis and 7.0 percent on a constant currency basis. And, on a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than sales in Brazil, Chile, China, Canada and India.","Now, let\u2019s move on and discuss the results by market. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis. In all of our countries except Brazil and China, our stores and e-commerce businesses are integrated and led by the same management teams. Therefore, our discussion of results is about the total operation. For Brazil and China, we will provide insights on the stores and e-commerce separately.","In the U.K., we continued to grow both sales and operating income in the second quarter of the year. Net sales rose 1.6 percent, and sales excluding fuel, increased 1.1 percent. Operating income grew 7.5 percent, and we did not leverage operating expenses.","Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, excluding fuel. Average comp traffic increased by 1.0 percent, but was offset by a decline in average ticket of 1.4 percent. Overall market share declined by 30 basis points for the 12 weeks ended July 7 according to the Kantar Worldpanel Total Till Roll.","Our operating income performance in the U.K. this quarter was driven by three key themes: first, a significant price investment which is moderating comp growth; second, investment in and growth of convenient channels and formats; and third, cost savings delivered via the \u201cWe operate for less\u201d program to help offset some of the headwinds we\u2019re experiencing.","The U.K. is an example of where we are leading with a core strength: investing in price on essential food items. The British consumer remains under pressure, with market inflation growing 2.8 percent, outpacing wage growth of 0.9 percent. Market product inflation is up, but our Asda basket is below market inflation. In addition, the UK is a market with unique competitive vouchering activity.","Some of our competition provides a voucher for a discount on a future purchase. During the quarter, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the grocery market grew by 3.5 percent -- driven by inflation of 3.9 percent, meaning grocery volume declined in the market.","Our price investment in key food essentials continued, especially in fresh produce, a key traffic driver. As a result, we grew market share in this category. The result was lower inflation across the overall basket for our customers. We continue to drive the \u201cwe operate for less\u201d program, achieving savings within both operating expenses and cost of goods sold.","Our improvement of 67 basis points in gross profit rate helped operating income grow faster than sales despite the continued price investment and inflationary pressures in areas such as property taxes, insurance and energy. Our gross profit rate in Asda improved largely because we didn\u2019t repeat promotional activity from last year\u2019s Queen\u2019s jubilee event and the Olympic Games.","Our Asda online grocery business is well developed and remains a model for us to leverage into other markets. Online sales, which are included in our net sales and comps, were strong in the quarter, growing over 16 percent. We continue to deliver an increasingly convenient, multichannel shopping experience for customers. In the second quarter, our first \u201cDrive Through Click & Collect\u201d site opened in York.","We also connected our smart phone app to stores through a new shopping list feature that can search for products using voice recognition or barcode scanning technology. In addition, given the shift in online traffic from desktop to mobile, we\u2019re the first major U.K. retailer to launch a dedicated tablet website for non-food business.","The quarter rounded off with some great awards showcasing our continued commitment to EDLP. Asda was recognized by The Grocer magazine in June, when we were named \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the sixteenth year running and \u201cBritain\u2019s Favourite Supermarket\u201d for the third year in a row.","Asda continues to make a difference in our local communities. During the quarter, we launched a market leading supply chain initiative delivering the equivalent of 3.5 million meals to local charities across the U.K. We partnered with the charity FareShare and more than 300 chilled food suppliers. This initiative alone will save more than 900 local charities 4.7 million British pounds, or $7.1 million, per year.","As we look at Canada, we were challenged by unseasonably cooler weather that continued from the previous quarter, as well as flooding in Alberta. Despite these challenges, net sales grew 6.2 percent, supported by new store growth and expansion of existing stores. Operating income grew slower than sales at 2.3 percent as we invested in new stores and e-commerce.","Comparable sales declined by 0.4 percent, with comp ticket up 0.2 percent and comp traffic declining 0.6 percent. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables and apparel, but continued to see softer sales in entertainment as industry-specific challenges persist. The colder weather negatively impacted sales in hardlines.","On the positive side, we drove market share gains by investing in price on the items that matter most. In The Nielsen Company measured categories of food and consumables, Walmart Canada gained 110 basis points of share. We also drove a further 60 basis points in health and wellness.","Gross profit rate increased 29 basis points due, in part, to cost savings from increased direct importing. Operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales and costs related to year-over-year growth in our new store base, including the 39 Zellers stores we acquired last year. However, through EDLC initiatives, Walmart Canada has been able to offset some of the expense growth with various productivity initiatives.","During the quarter, we opened one new supercentre, expanded four stores to supercentres and relocated one store. This includes our first supercentre in Atlantic Canada and provided us with a truly nationwide presence for our supercentre program.","We responded to the floods in southern Alberta and the devastating explosion in Quebec through fundraising campaigns in partnership with the Red Cross. Cash and in-kind donations to support these victims exceeded $900,000.","Turning to Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly-held company in South Africa and announces their results every six months. Massmart\u2019s next earnings release is August 22nd. For the 26 weeks ended June 23rd, net sales increased by 8.9 percent, and comp store sales increased by 5.5 percent. We remain optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us within Africa, and we\u2019re working to position ourselves for success in the future.","Now, let\u2019s cover Latin America. As a reminder, the following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported its earnings on July 25th, under IFRS, so some numbers are different from the Walmex-reported numbers.","Walmex results were solid in Central America, but growth slowed in Mexico, and this impacted overall performance. For the quarter, net sales grew 3.2 percent. Gross profit rate increased by 58 basis points versus last year, driven by increases in both Mexico and Central America.","In Central America, the gross margin improvement was driven by both EDLC and EDLP execution and better inventory management made possible by the recent integration of Walmart systems. Operating expenses grew faster than sales in Walmex. Operating income for the quarter grew 4.2 percent, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins.","For the second quarter, Mexico\u2019s sales increased 3.1 percent over last year and comparable store sales decreased 1.6 percent, as they were negatively impacted by the Easter flip. Self-service and Sam\u2019s Club second quarter comparable growth was negative 1.8 percent, which is similar to ANTAD\u2019s comparable store sales reported for the rest of the industry at negative 1.6 percent excluding Walmex. Average comp ticket increased 1.4 percent, and comp traffic decreased 3.0 percent over last year. Traffic was impacted by the Easter calendar shift and a general market slowdown in consumption.","In Mexico, gross margin was up 19 basis points. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales. As I mentioned earlier, we improved expense management, but it wasn\u2019t quite enough to offset the sales miss. Wages and utilities remain headwinds. Operating income decreased 0.7 percent, below our expectations. We are working hard to bring expenses more in line with sales.","Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.2 percent. Comparable store sales decreased 0.1 percent. Gross profit rate increased 2.8 percent versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is complete, and these results reflect the opportunity for growth through that strategy. Expenses grew slower than sales. Operating income increased 246 percent.","Moving on to Brazil \u2026 second quarter net sales in Brazil grew 2.8 percent from last year, with comparable sales up 1.1 percent. Average ticket grew 6.6 percent, and comp traffic declined 5.5 percent when compared to last year. Sales were impacted by the Easter flip, a holiday which represents one of the biggest seasons for food sales in Brazil. Despite this impact, the retail formats showed positive comps, with good performance in consumables, food and perishables. Our results in the wholesale formats were below expectations.","Gross profit rate increased 50 basis points, but we did not leverage operating expenses due in part to the lower comp sales growth and wage inflation. Operating expenses grew faster than sales during the quarter. The net effect of the sales shortfall and our expense performance was an operating loss for the quarter. We continue to focus on the productivity loop in order to invest savings back into price to further drive sales. Brazil is now taking steps to align expenses more closely to the volume of sales.","We\u2019re pleased with the growth of e-commerce sales in Brazil. In fact, we grew from the #8 most visited site last October to the #1 spot now, according to comScore. Customers have responded well to the enhancements on the site, and sales are up more than 50 percent versus last year. 25","Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release second quarter earnings on August 30th. Earlier this year, we completed a merchandise training program in Chile focused on modular and buying strategies.","Since that training, we have reduced the number of modular changes by 40 percent and reduced the number of price labels by 20 percent, while still maintaining strong price impression. This program is saving labor hours at the store level, but more importantly, it\u2019s improving trust with the customer through a more consistent set of modulars. This is another good example of where global experience can benefit a local market.","Moving to Asia, in the second quarter, without the acquisition of Yihaodian, Walmart China\u2019 s net sales grew 6.3 percent over last year and comparable store sales growth was 2.5 percent. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, customers continue to shift from traditional daily shopping to larger consolidated shopping trips. Average comp ticket grew 9.3 percent in China, while traffic declined 6.8 percent.","Our EDLP journey in China continues to move forward. We\u2019re building trust with the Chinese customer through our \u201cworry free\u201d program. Worry free pricing was launched last fall and continues to gain traction. The team in China continues to improve operations by focusing on optimizing the buying organization, investing in logistics and food safety and simplifying the supply chain. Gross profit rate declined 56 basis points compared to last year. We leveraged operating expenses despite wage inflation.","As I mentioned earlier, Walmart China reduced store labor hours through various productivity initiatives and improved scheduling. Last year, we discussed our decision to moderate our growth in China and focus more on our store opening process and opening stores in more productive locations, an example of our commitment to simplifying and prioritizing.","Our team in China is making progress with the customer and as a retail operator. I\u2019m really encouraged by the recent results in China and thankful for the strong leadership we\u2019re seeing from Greg Foran, Sean Clarke and the rest of the leadership team.","And, a final comment on e-commerce in China. We\u2019re pleased with the acquisition of Yihaodian, with sales continuing to grow well in the double digits. The site continues to be one of the fastest-growing e-commerce businesses in the country.","In Japan, consumer spending continued to be soft during the quarter. Walmart Japan\u2019s net sales growth remained flat and comp sales decreased 0.6 percent. During the quarter, we posted our first positive monthly comp since May of 2012. Our stores continue to create a better price impression for customers as they are shopping.","Second quarter comp traffic decreased 1.1 percent, and average ticket increased 0.5 percent. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined 1.3 percent from last year, so we outperformed the market.","Gross profit rate in Japan decreased 13 basis points, due to our investment in lower prices. Compared to last year, Walmart Japan had higher operating income and increased operating margin 13 basis points. Walmart Japan also leveraged operating expenses versus last year due to tight cost control efforts.","In Japan, we continue to leverage Walmart\u2019s global scale to improve customer assortment and deliver better value to our customers. Examples are beef imported from the United States, and cherries, wine and beer from the U.K., and we had great results from introducing \u201cGolden Ale\u201d beer in Japan. In just one month, it became Japan\u2019s second best-selling beer in the 500 ml beer category and the most profitable in the entire beer category.","As you are aware, we have a significant effort and investment under way to enhance compliance. We\u2019re committed to compliance and integrity everywhere we operate. These investments are building a stronger, better Walmart for our customers, our associates and communities, and will provide a more solid foundation for future growth.","Although I only mentioned a couple of examples today, we remain committed globally to improving the communities where we live and operate. In addition to responding to disasters and helping those in need, other programs create a better Walmart and a better shopping experience for our customers -- like developing local farmers and supporting the growth of women-owned businesses.","We appreciate all the hard work of our international associates. The third quarter is well under way for our markets. In a global macroeconomic environment where the rate of growth is less than expected, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our consumers through our EDLC-EDLP approach. EDLP improves our ability to deliver against our purpose and better serve our customers who count on us to meet their family\u2019s needs.","We expect the third and fourth quarters to be better than our results in the first half, and we\u2019re working hard to deliver operating expense leverage for Walmart International. Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Roz for a look at our Sam\u2019s U.S. business. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer ","Thanks Doug. Before I start, I\u2019d like to compliment both our management teams and our Sam\u2019s Club associates. They are so energized by the changes taking place in our clubs and remain aligned on driving member value through price leadership, differentiated merchandise and a compelling experience. We still have work to do, but I\u2019m pleased to report that Q2 comp sales were within our guidance, and traffic improved. We are delivering solid membership income growth, and our recent membership enhancements, including the Instant Savings Book (ISB), continue to receive a favorable response.","Let me take a moment to provide more background on our Instant Savings program, now a cornerstone of Sam\u2019s Club membership. In fact, we have renamed our Advantage members to Savings members because of our mission to deliver savings made simple for all of our members.","The second quarter marked the launch of our Instant Savings program. Members received two Instant Savings Books during the quarter. Each book runs for about three weeks and includes special savings from our top suppliers beyond our normal member-only prices.","We were pleased to see over half of the members who shopped during the events purchased at least one Instant Savings Book item. The book not only drove traffic to our clubs, but also broader awareness of our extensive merchandise offering available at samsclub.com. For example, during the first few days of the May event, we sold more of the office chairs online included in the ISB than we had year-to-date!","We believe that the investment we\u2019re making in price, both through core reductions and programs like Instant Savings, are key to sales growth, and this strategy will continue throughout the year.","Now back to the results. Sam\u2019s Club generated a comp of 1.7 percent, without fuel, for the 13-week retail sales period. Our investment in the ISB program decreased our overall average selling price, resulting in a comp ticket decline of 1.0 percent. This was countered by comp traffic growth of 2.7 percent, driven by positive traffic for both our Savings and business members. We were pleased with our improvement in business member traffic, reversing the first quarter\u2019s decrease in business member traffic.","Small business owners report through our monthly Small Business Owner study, that they are more optimistic about the upcoming months and perceive that the current economic climate is gradually improving. We believe their businesses are beginning to show signs of recovery, as evidenced by the improved traffic trends. As part of our commitment to this portion of our member base, Sam\u2019s Club recently launched the 25-city \u201cGrow Your Business Boot Camp\u201d series. It\u2019s a program that allows leaders at Sam\u2019s to support small business owners and entrepreneurs in their local communities.","Now on to our core financial news \u2026 Net sales, including fuel, were $14.5 billion, up 2.6 percent over last year. Fuel prices increased 1.6 percent compared to last year and gallons sold were up 2.6 percent, thus creating a boost to overall sales of 22 basis points. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate declined by 15 basis points, and we leveraged expenses, improving operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 3 basis points. Operating income increased 3 percent to $551 million.","Our goal remains to grow inventory at half the rate of sales, and we are pleased at the progress compared to the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, inventory, including fuel, was up just 2 percent.","Volatility in fuel prices can influence our financial results, especially profitability. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business, excluding fuel for comparative purposes.","Net sales for the quarter were $12.8 billion, up 2.4 percent from last year. All geographic divisions had positive comps. Inflation, excluding fuel, was about 30 basis points. Inflation in fresh meat and dairy was coupled with continued deflation in electronics. Last year, retail inflation was between 175 and 225 basis points, primarily in food.","Fresh posted a low single-digit comp, driven by strength in breads and produce. Lingering effects of unseasonably cold weather affected produce availability in some of our key summer fruit items, such as strawberries and watermelons.","We overcame this headwind with exceptional quality in other seasonal produce items such as blueberries and apples, resulting in a mid single-digit produce comp. Unit sales of fresh meat remain strong; however, we have seen some trade-down from steaks to lower price point items, such as chicken and pork. \u201cBetter for you\u201d items continue to resonate with our members who are searching for healthier options.","Our grocery and beverage category generated a low single-digit comp. Members responded positively to our dry grocery Instant Savings Book items. However, the growth was not enough to offset seasonal softness in beverages, as Q2 this year was cooler than last year. We continue to execute our strategy of bringing newness and differentiation to these categories, particularly in areas such as craft beers.","Our efforts to reach families with babies continued to pay off, with market share gains in the baby category for the 13-week period ending July 6, 2013, according to Nielsen. Additionally, the ISB events contributed to the growth in consumables, resulting in a low single-digit comp for the quarter.","Technology and entertainment posted a low single-digit negative comp. Positive Instant Savings Book event performance and continued strength in wireless was tempered by softness in the overall consumer electronics market, as shoppers continue to shift spending from TVs and laptops to mobile devices.","In home and apparel, we were pleased that sales rebounded from the prior quarter, delivering a high single-digit comp in Q2. As the weather warmed, our offerings in apparel and seasonal categories resonated with members and generated low double-digit comps and mid single-digits, respectively. Home continues to be strong, as price leadership in domestics drove double-digit comp and unit growth.","Health and wellness, including pharmacy, reported a mid single-digit comp, propelled by sustained strength in the over-the-counter products and growth in optical. During Q2, we lapped the branded-to-generic status change of several popular prescriptions, which should serve as a tailwind to pharmacy sales during the back half of the year.","Tobacco sales growth was essentially flat. A nationwide price increase in June drove business members to accelerate tobacco purchases, providing a moderate benefit to the beginning of the quarter.","Sam\u2019s Club online business continues to grow, driven by solid traffic and improved conversion rates. Merchandise strength came from outdoor living, portable electronics, baby care, and mattresses that offset some of the general softness in other electronics categories. Recently, the team has made enhancements to our mobile app, helping to increase the number of mobile orders, compared to the prior quarter.","Now, let\u2019s continue with the results. Gross profit rate grew 6 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 2 basis points.","Membership and other income grew 9.2 percent. On May 15, we took our first nationwide membership fee increase in 6 years. During the quarter, net membership income increased 4 percent. Our primary base continues to grow year-over-year, driven by Savings member sign-ups. Plus sign-ups and upgrades also showed strength, partially offset by softness in business member sign-ups. Remember, we recognize the full benefit of the fee increase over the 12-month membership period.","Looking at the bottom line, our second quarter operating income grew to $552 million, a substantial increase of 8 percent over last year. As I mentioned earlier, the level of engagement among our club associates is very strong. In our annual engagement survey conducted this past spring, Sam\u2019s Club associate engagement scores rose 600 basis points over last year, with gains in each geographic division across the country. Over the past quarter, I\u2019ve visited several recently remodeled clubs. I\u2019ve been pleased with the disciplined progress the team has made to increase the consistency of our remodels.","Next quarter, we will open 13 new and relocated clubs, the greatest number of clubs opened during one quarter within the past several years. The team is ready to continue growing the Sam\u2019s footprint, serving even more members in more communities.","Last quarter, I mentioned that you will begin to see a change in our merchandise strategy. We\u2019ve begun this transformation, specifically in areas such as home and apparel. Our members look to us for great values on the best quality items, and we will continue working hard to deliver, striving to be a house of brands for our members. This transformation will continue, especially as we enter the holiday season.","I\u2019m excited to invite you to our upcoming VIP event. Please join me, on August 18, as we open our doors exclusively to Plus members, appreciating them with exceptional values on an array of back-to-school items and unique, one-time buys. VIP events such as these are just one of the ways we have worked to strengthen our value proposition for Plus members. We will continue to stress seasonal offerings throughout the third quarter.","We expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 27 to October 25 to range between flat and 2 percent. Last year\u2019s comp, without fuel, for the period was 2.7 percent.","The core business at Sam\u2019s Club is strong. I\u2019m confident that the things we\u2019re doing today to strengthen our value proposition will benefit Sam\u2019s over the long term. Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Neil for e-commerce. Neil?","Neil Ashe ","Thanks Roz. In eCommerce, we\u2019ve continued to deliver key capabilities, and we are growing sales, including acquisitions, at over 30 percent globally. Bill, Roz and Doug touched on some of the accomplishments from around the world, and I\u2019ll put those in the context of our overall eCommerce strategies.","As a reminder, the four strategies we are executing are: Excelling in the fundamentals of e-commerce; innovating in new areas like big data, social and mobile; we\u2019re growing in key markets, namely the U.S., U.K., Brazil and China; and we\u2019re providing the tie to unite and expand the Walmart customer experience to do what no one else can do.","We\u2019re building best-in-class e-commerce capabilities, and only we can combine those with the assets of the world\u2019s largest retailer. The result is a new approach to commerce that lets customers shop when, where and how they want across online, mobile and stores. To support the strategies, we\u2019re investing in three key areas: further developing our global technology platform; growing services and capabilities in our four key markets; and developing our next-generation fulfillment network that integrates dedicated online assets with Walmart\u2019s transportation fleet, distribution centers and stores.","Before I jump into each of these, let me cover our progress in building talent density. We\u2019ve continued to bring on great people organically and through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we had a hiring blitz which ramped up our visibility in the Bay area and added nearly 200 associates. We saw an offer acceptance rate well over 90 percent. People in Silicon Valley are excited to come to Walmart.","We also closed four acquisitions -- Tasty Labs, OneOps, Inkiru and Torbit. They brought us some proven innovators in Silicon Valley, and technical capabilities and expertise to contribute to the development of our global technology platform. We continue to develop and release elements of our technology platform, like search and the walmart.com home page. We\u2019re pleased with the progress to date and excited the experience for our customers is already improving as a result.","The platform is also at the core of expanding our product assortment, especially in the U.S. We doubled the number of products on walmart.com in the first half of the year through our own inventory and through new marketplace sellers. We expect to double it again in the second half of the fiscal year.","On the fulfillment front, we are optimizing how we use online fulfillment centers in conjunction with Walmart\u2019s shipping network, DCs and stores. Bill touched on how we are activating supercenters as part of our work to deliver a better customer experience, and we\u2019re seeing great results on that front. We are now using 35 stores as additional nodes in our online fulfillment network.","As Bill mentioned, those stores now handle a double-digit percentage of walmart.com orders, and the majority of those are delivered in two days or less at a significantly lower cost. As you know, the Pick Up Today option gives customers the ability to buy an item online and pick it up in a store that same day.","We have more than tripled the items available for Pick Up Today since the beginning of the year. And, we have developed a new capability that automatically searches our broader inventory for an item if that item isn\u2019t available in a customer\u2019s primary store. That has significantly improved our fill rate.","We\u2019ve also talked about our plans to test lockers as another option for customers picking up online orders in stores. The test is successful so far, showing 90 percent customer satisfaction ratings.","On the grocery delivery front, Asda is a leader in online grocery delivery, and we\u2019ve leveraged that experience in the U.S. pilot program. In the San Francisco\/San Jose test, we\u2019ve proven we can successfully use a supercenter for online grocery delivery, and we\u2019re getting high marks from customers. Many of these are new customers. 75 percent of the customers say they would have purchased through another retailer other than Walmart. And, 83 percent would recommend Walmart grocery delivery.","Roz talked about the e-commerce growth at Sam\u2019s Club, and we\u2019ve been working together to enhance the customer experience across online, mobile and clubs. We built a new mobile app for Sam\u2019s Club that helped increase the average basket by almost 25 percent over the last quarter. We also made enhancements on the mobile site that helped double the number of orders from the last quarter.","As Doug discussed, we had several global successes as well. Continuing on the mobile theme, we\u2019re making great progress in China. Yihaodian saw 10 times growth in mobile sales in the first half over last year and won a Cannes Media Lions award for its boundless Yihaodian 2.0 app. Yihaodian overall continues to grow quickly. We are pleased that we have more than doubled the number of active site users in the past year, meaning those customers who made at least one purchase in the last 12 months.","In the U.K., we just completed a major relaunch of the Asda site. In addition to a new experience, we made some foundational changes that allow us to enhance the site much more quickly and easily. Major redesigns like this one take a bit of time for customers to get used to the enhancements, so we\u2019re pleased to see initial site satisfaction is up 9 percent versus the previous site.","Finally, we are excited about the opportunity we have in Brazil and the world-class leadership team we\u2019ve built there. During the quarter, we made several site enhancements to walmart.com.br, including streamlined navigation and check-out flow. We are the largest traffic consumer e-commerce site in Brazil and our revenue growth \u2013 led by electronics and appliances \u2013 is more than double the rate of the total Brazilian e-commerce market according to eMarketer. And, we were recognized by eBit as the top e-commerce site over 4,000 other sites.","To wrap up \u2026 we are making great progress on our core strategies. We are continuing to invest for the long-term and are building the talent base, the technology platform and the fulfillment networks we need to serve customers around the globe seamlessly across online, mobile and stores in a way that only Walmart can.","Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Charles for the close. Charles?","Charles Holley ","Thanks Neil. Normally on our earnings call, I begin by talking about growth, leverage and returns and then conclude with our guidance. Today, I\u2019d like to start by providing our expectations for sales and earnings for the third quarter and the full year.","Economic conditions in many of our markets around the world remain difficult. The U.S. retail environment remains challenging, with virtually no inflation in food and the higher payroll tax instituted earlier in the year. High fuel prices can impact spending as well. Our expectations for the back half of the year are through a lens of cautious consumer spending.","Our mission to save people money so they can live better remains critical to customers and to our ability to drive stronger sales. Our plans are aggressive. We are going after sales and investing in price. And, we continue to focus on leveraging expenses. As Mike said, we are taking steps to increase our leverage potential for the full year.","We are revising our consolidated net sales growth to range between 2 and 3 percent for the full year, versus our previous range of 5 to 6 percent. This revision reflects softer sales performance in the first half and our view of current global business trends, including a challenging retail environment, and significant ongoing headwinds from anticipated currency rate fluctuations. In fact, approximately one-third of the net sales revision is due to currency impact.","We believe expenses for FCPA matters and for the work on enhancing our compliance program will be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year. Year to date, we have spent approximately $155 million. We\u2019re forecasting the run rate for the combined work on the compliance programs and the ongoing investigations to be between $75 and $80 million each in the third and fourth quarters.","E-commerce is important to our customers and our company\u2019s future. Our forecasts also take into account that we will continue to invest in technology, talent and infrastructure, including fulfillment centers. Year to date, the incremental impact from e-commerce investments is approximately $0.05 per share. We anticipate the incremental impact to third quarter earnings per share will be about $0.02 per share.","Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to range between $1.11 and $1.16. This compares to $1.08 per share last year.","For the full year, we are updating our prior earnings per share guidance to $5.10 and $5.30 per share. This guidance takes into account the challenging sales and operating environments. As we\u2019ve seen in the past, discrete tax items have had a meaningful impact on our effective tax rate and on our reported results in the back half of our fiscal years. We anticipate that a wider range of between 31 and 33 percent is now possible for our full year effective tax rate versus our previous range of 32 to 33 percent.","What isn\u2019t changing is our continued focus on Walmart\u2019s financial priorities -- growth, leverage and returns. The company\u2019s growth during the second quarter included 98 net new stores and clubs, comprising 5.9 million new square feet of selling space.","Now, let\u2019s talk about leverage. We told you during the first quarter call that achieving operating expense leverage during the second quarter would be challenging \u2013 and that proved to be true. The productivity loop is top of mind across the organization, and we remain focused on delivering leverage for the company by year-end.","Long-term strategic investments by our leverage services area pressured operating expense leverage during the past quarter, but we believe the benefits of these investments to our customers and shareholders outweigh the near-term impact on expenses. Earlier, Mike covered a few examples of our leverage progress.","We are piloting new programs in logistics to lower the cost of delivery and improve profitability for e-commerce orders. The modular excellence program for Walmart U.S. is helping to maximize holding power for key items in food and consumables. Modular planning processes created by the Global Business Processes team are helping to reduce labor hours in China and Brazil while improving associate productivity.","Moving on to returns, we feel good about our earnings per share growth, especially in light of the retail environment. The company returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. We also generated solid cash flows from operations, and our free cash flow is now at $5.2 billion for the year. The company continues to deliver strong, consistent returns to shareholders.","As I wrap-up the call today, let me leave you with a few key takeaways. First, we know we have to improve the top line. With our expense leverage, stronger sales will flow through our results. Second, our updated guidance reflects the current view of the business and difficult retail environment, but also considers the significant impact from currency, along with the ongoing investments in leverage, e-commerce and compliance initiatives. And, last, we continue to build on our long history of returning value to our shareholders.","Thank you for your support and interest in our company. Have a great day!","Detailed Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The forward-looking statements in this call that are intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, generally are identified by the use of the words or 39 phrases \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201care forecasting,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cwill contribute,\u201d \u201cwill drive,\u201d \u201cwill grow,\u201d \u201cwill have,\u201d \u201cwill open,\u201d \u201cwill remain,\u201d or a variation of one of those words or phrases in those statements, or by the use of words and phrases of similar import.","Similarly, descriptions of Walmart\u2019s objectives, plans, goals, targets or expectations are forward-looking statements.

[Operator Instructions].","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Kary Brunner. Please go ahead.","Kary Brunner","Thanks, Rob. Good morning everyone This is Kary Brunner and I'm here with the rest of the Walmart Investor Relations team. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I will begin with a brief overview and then we will open it up for questions. As a reminder our Q1 press release, management commentary and accompanying slide presentation are available on the investor relations portion of our corporate website. We may make forward-looking statements during this call which are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in the Safe Harbor statement on our website at stock.walmart.com and in our quarterly and annual SEC filings. I would like to point out that this quarter the Company revises corporate overhead allocations to the operating segments. Accordingly previous operating income was recast to be comparable to the current period's presentation. So now let me discuss our Q1 results. Overall we had a solid quarter across the company. We are encouraged by the progress made across the business and the continued momentum we are seeing. On a constant currency basis consolidated net sales were up 2.7%.","Adjusted EPS was a $1.14, a 14% increase versus last year. You would have noticed GAAP EPS was $0.72 per share, the main difference versus adjusted EPS is related to the new accounting rule which requires us to recognize gains or losses on some equity investments. During this quarter jd.com stock decreased in price causing the accounting loss but we still have a solid gains in the shares since we acquired our stakes.","Our U.S. comp sales increased 2.1%, our comp was trending higher through early April but general merchandise sales and traffic were somewhat negatively impacted by cool weather in April. This business has picked up again as the weather normalize. We would have seen that our Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales accelerated in the first quarter with 33% growth contributed 100 basis points to the comp. Walmart International had another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth, were eight of 11 markets reported positive comps including our four largest markets. The earlier timing of Easter help pull some sales forward into the first quarter in a few market. Sam's Club comp sales were driven by strong comps traffic. As in past years we will update certain full year guidance with our second quarter release. So in closing we have good momentum in the business. We're focused on distributing customers more effectively and we're executing on our strategy. With that we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Our question is regarding e-commerce and growth in the quarter's ahead. What would you say are some of the main drivers in terms of your guidance in driving and improvements there you showed some nice momentum this quarter and more generally if you could help us focus on the aspects which will improve e-commerce profitability over time or how you're thinking about balancing growth versus profitability that would be helpful. Thank you.","Kary Brunner","We are really pleased with performance in Q1 for our U.S. e-commerce business with 33% growth. We are seeing good momentum with right assortment and the right pricing supported by marketing. Online grocery is also a contributor to our e-commerce growth and you've seem us introduce a number of initiatives including the expansion of online grocery as well as grocery delivery in the U.S. this year. We think a combination of executing the fundamentals of e-commerce and continue to make progress there will help us achieve our full year net sales school. So we're pretty pleased with where we were in Q1 and we're turning to the right direction to meet our full year goal.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Just lastly on curbside pick-up that's been impressive the speed at which you're expanding that. Are there any thoughts on the nature of that customer versus your other customer? Are you happy with the economics of that mechanism and also what it may mean for omni-channel customers would love any thoughts there. Thank you.","Kary Brunner","Sure. Yes we have been very pleased with online grocery. Customers really love the service, it's very convenient for them. Our net promoter scores are still very strong and so as you know it's an important initiative for us. We are rolling out an additional thousand locations this year to reach 2100 locations by the end of this year with online grocery pick-up. We see it as just providing choice for the customer providing the convenience as they can shop Walmart and all the ways they choose to shop.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Marco on for Michael Lasser. I wanted to dig into the U.S. business a bit, can you guys quantify any of the weather impacts on the comp and then is accelerating e-commerce growth cannibalizing in-store sales? Thanks.","Kary Brunner","Yes the U.S. business was kind of really strong quarter. We did have some headwinds we faced at the end of the quarter in April with some seasonally cool weather that impacted some of our general merchandise weather sensitive categories as well as some traffic in those categories. As we've started Q2 some of those categories are turning around as weather has normalized. Overall the health of the business is very strong. Our grocery business continues to have strong traffic and sales you saw that our ticket was good this quarter as well. So overall health of the business is very good.","Unidentified Analyst","And then as a follow-up to Oliver's question, how much did the rollout of online grocery pick up to more stores contribute to e-commerce growth and is grocery delivery typically more or less impactful than pick up? Thanks.","Kary Brunner","Yes, it is a contributing factor to our overall 33% growth in both the contribution of ship to home as well as online grocery pickup.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on the delivery versus pick-up?","Kary Brunner","Yes we are just starting to roll out delivery across the U.S., we think it's an important additional choice we can provide to customers. Clearly the customer has really appreciated the online grocery pickup service and so we think this is just another choice that customers can make more providing for [indiscernible] and shop Wal-Mart.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","Simeon Gutman","I want to follow up and maybe put this question to bed on the weather Kary, I guess you're choosing not to sort of quantify and maybe it's hard to quantify the weather impact. I think the important question around it is that you are making price investments so I think you know some would have expected the traffic to be a little bit higher but so if you have any kind comment on that and then if I guess you can whether or not you're not going to quantify the weather impact. ","Kary Brunner","Yes. As you saw in our material this morning, our overall grocery business was very solid with strong traffic and sales, unit growth in grocery categories and then the weather really impacted our general merchandise traffic and sales. So in areas like you know sporting goods, in areas like apparels that are [indiscernible] swinsuits things like that. So really weather was specific to primarily to general merchandise categories in the traffic and sales. We didn't quantify it but we did call it, it was a headwind, comp sales were trending before, this cooler weather hit us [indiscernible].","Simeon Gutman","Okay, and my follow-up is if you look at just e-com acceleration, where does it get captured in the comp, does that get captured in both the traffic and the ticket or is that captured in the traffic alone?","Kary Brunner","No its traffic and ticket. If it touches the store it will impact our traffic network.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Horvers","I'm going to try my best to ask similar questions, so you know if you look at the past two quarters the back half of '17, you take out the hurricane in the third quarter. You know you're comping in that like 2\/3 sort of 2\/4 kind of range is that a good approximation of sort of the underlying business did ex-the weather.","Kary Brunner","Yes, again we are not quantifying the weather impact. We have told you the categories that it impacted, our grocery business was less impacted as a result of been strong with traffic and sales, ticket was stronger, we did see some trip consolidation but we are not going to quantify the weather impact other than say it was an impact and has weather has normalized sales have turned around on those categories.","Chris Horvers","Also wanted to e-commerce growth, so first a clarification was the 33% all organic and then maybe you could help us put it into context by [indiscernible] the 23 in the fourth quarter versus the 33 in the first quarter here. You know refresh the factors that drove that drop off in 4Q and then bridge it out in -- did you reverse course on any strategy around pricing or assortment that helped you know that you may be turned off in 4Q that drove a really acceleration for 1Q.","Kary Brunner","Yes you'll recall that in Q4 we talked about a number of factors that impacted our overall growth rate and most of it was planned we plan to be down in Q4 relative to the prior year due to some promotional approach year prior and so really to create a better healthier top and bottom line mix in certain categories in e-Commerce that was the primary driver of the headwinds there. You know the business has accelerated in Q1, we had said that we expected to be higher in Q1 but not reach the 40% growth rate and that's kind of what we saw. We're really pleased really executing the fundamentals better, certainly new initiatives that have been rolled out recently we think are a component to overall reaching our full year goals. Things like the site redesign, the recently announced [indiscernible], think about our online grocery pickup and expanding the locations there as well as the new delivery component. So all these factors will contribute and then it comes down to just executing on the fundamentals Mark talks a lot about scaling the fundamentals and that's just being there to serve the customers so that they can shop you with the right price, the right assortment and the right experience overall online will contribute to our growth goals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Matt Fassler","My first question relates to the expense ratio in the Walmart U.S. business you spoke about having leverage in the stores but deleveraged overall on some incremental investments and tech and e-commerce. Is this the change you're all on the pace of investment in that business within the U.S.? Or was the deleverage more of a function of the fact the sales slipped at that late in the quarter?","Kary Brunner","Yes, e-commerce and technology were headwind to our Wal-Mart U.S. business and we are pleased that the store continues to operate very efficiently such that the U.S. store business leverage expenses in the quarter. The work that we've done around operating efficiency and leveraging technology within our stores really contributing to the ability to leverage expenses and we are pleased with that.","Matt Fassler","And as you think about that digital investment do you have a piece of it, is that something that you'd expect to persist through the year?","Kary Brunner","We did talk about in Q4 that as a result of tax reform and the benefits that we received there we made some strategic choices to reinvest in the business and one of the components and areas of reinvestment was in e-commerce and technology. So that is a focus area this year as well as a result of those tax benefits.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually John Park [ph] on for Chuck. If we kind of just look at the U.S. business business, is there anyway to decouple the drag in gross margins between the price investments and the headwind?","Kary Brunner","We do continue to invest in price in the U.S. it's important component of our overall strategy and we expect that to be a headwind to gross margin as we have talked about in the past. We did see a tick up in transportation expenses, we didn\u2019t breakout the quantification between each but we are seeing as a result of increased fuel prices in the U.S. as well as some impact from higher trucking market rates but again we didn't break out the components of the overall decline.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just switching gears a little bit, how big was the loss in the disposal of Canadian banking business and then I guess the store closings at Sam's?","Kary Brunner","Yes, we called out $81 million for the loss related to the Canada Bank.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Kelly","Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the gross margin the improvement in the decline in Q1 versus Q4 and if you were to sort of parse it out what do you think the biggest change was there?","Kary Brunner","Yes, theirs is a lot of components to go into overall gross margin and if you think about the U.S. specifically the main drivers of gross margin headwinds continue to be our strategy to strategically invest in prices and be thoughtful about that and as well as you know the transportation expense that you see impacting not Walmart U.S. business but also the Sam's Club business as well. [Indiscernible] had some onetime items, unique items within there some headwinds in Sam's Club regarding the club closures and inventory liquidations and you saw that come through a little bit in Q1 as well.","Edward Kelly","Okay. So quick follow-up on the SG&A side and particular labor. How are you thinking about wage rates at this point given you know what we heard from Target and their desire to go higher over time?","Kary Brunner","Yes. As we noted we recently increased the starting wage rate for our U.S. associates $11 an hour and you know part of the benefit that we received from tax reform that was one of the components that was reinvested into the business and we're pleased to be able to do that. We're going to be competitive in the markets that we operate in to get the right talent to run our stores.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Drbul","Couple of questions, on the online business can you talk about trends in pick up in store outside of grocery and I guess in the last few quarters you talked about the mix impact on the gross margin from e-commerce. Can you just talk about if that had at all a factor, any factor on the gross margin line for this quarter?","Kary Brunner","Yes your first question Bob around pickup outside of grocery, you know overall if you think about our omni-channel approach in the U.S. online grocery is as we mentioned earlier on this call really pleased with the progress there and pick up as well, non-grocery really pick up. You heard us talk about rolling out additional pick up towers and our stores is fully automated pick up towers where customers can be in and out with their general merchandise order in a matter of minutes and so we're really pleased with that, as you've heard us talk about in the past we think we have a real opportunity to leverage the proximity to customers that we have with our stores to provide convenience and that's exactly what we're doing. So we're pleased overall with the strategy both on the grocery side as well as those non- grocery. What was your second question about?","Bob Drbul","Mix impact on the gross margin line from e-commerce, you had called it out before but it wasn\u2019t called out this quarter I was just wondering if you could just maybe.","Kary Brunner","Yes this was one of the primary drivers for this quarter so we called out price investments in the U.S. as well as the higher transportation expense that we experienced those were the primary drivers of the headwind this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.","Peter Benedict","So just on private brand growth it was called out in the U.S. comp section. Remind us kind of the steps you guys have been taking lately to drive that business, is it something you're doing or do you think that consumers just kind of making these decisions kind of absent any major focus by you guys?","Kary Brunner","Thanks Peter. We have really stepped up our focus on private brands. Wal-Mart has long been a house of national brands and it's important to our overall strategy as its easy to communicate your every day low prices relative to the competition when you have national brands so that's important but we have seen opportunity to increase the quality of our private brands and probably the most recent example is our introduction of new apparel brands. We think there's an opportunity to again extra share of wallet as a result of providing quality private brands so we are focused not only on quality in the grocery and non-grocery areas but also in the quality of price that we offer to the customer.","Peter Benedict","And then just turning international to the relationship you guys have with JD.com in China, can you talk about some of the capabilities that they have that can be used to help you guys here in the U.S., the comments in the transcript kind of had some indications that there would be some leverage there in terms of taking these capabilities outside of China and just whatever you're comfortable speaking to where could we see maybe next fall to 24 months some of these capabilities in JD.com has showing up here in the United States. Thank you.","Kary Brunner","Sure. If you think about our portfolio of companies, Wal-Mart has a long history of really sharing best practices and leveraging learning from various markets and certainly on omni-channel front and the building of the customer to be served in an efficient matter as we called out in the script you know 177 stores through JD.com are getting one hour delivery service. I mean we're able to leverage those learnings as we expand omni-channel in the U.S. as well and so its not unlike what we have done in the past in a sense of sharing best practices for the benefit of the whole business, but certainly there's a lot to learn from how our customers serve, there's different density population levels so it's not exact like for like but our shared learning are something that's part of our heritage and something we will continue to leverage in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell","The Sam's Club business was remarkably better than I think your initial thoughts coming into the year especially with the negative impacts from tobacco, just walk through some of the drivers of the comp out performance and how we should think about that business now on a go forward basis?","Kary Brunner","Yes, Sam's did have a good first quarter and really across the categories, our food business in Sam's, grocery business worked really well particularly on fresh with strong performances in produce in Delhi and some of the other areas there but really across the board Sam's had a good performance and traffic is good, traffic is good strong at Sam's Club and we just continue to focus on serving the member with value and the right assortment to continue to move the business forward. ","Paul Trussell","And just to circle back on the delivery, you know years ago you guys did a pilot out in Denver, did a number of [indiscernible] and ultimately decided that the economics didn\u2019t work overall in the U.S. for grocery delivery. Just help us understand the economics today and why the model all of a sudden does work for you guys?","Kary Brunner","Yes, as we have thought about omni-channel and really the maturity of different offerings for the customer to provide convenience for that customer you know Walmart always tests and learn from different approaches and we see the opportunity to serve customers in a variety of ways. Online grocery pick up is something that's been well received leveraging the proximity of our source of the customer and delivery is something that's another choice for the customer because the customers can choose that convenience by paying a fee of $9.95, they can get their grocery order delivered right to their door step.","So we're trying a lot of things and ultimately we're here to serve the customer in the best way that we can and offer them choice and that's really what you see us doing in our omni-channel approach.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Robbie Ohmes","Just a few follow-ups on the us.com business. First is, can you give us the U.S. GMV growth for the quarter and then the second is and I'm sorry if you said this already but can you give us roughly how many online grocery locations you had at the end of the first quarter and then the third the follow up to the Paul's question I think Brett's comments mentioned beginning the rollout of new grocery delivery service was that the roll out you're already doing or was there something even more new that's coming in and maybe remind us how you're thinking about partners for delivery because I know you guys stopped working with Uber and Lyft. So thanks for that.","Kary Brunner","Sure, Robbie, thanks for the question. So overall online grocery is now in around 1400 locations around the U.S. and as we've mentioned we plan to continue to roll out more locations throughout the year to reach around 2100 locations by the end of the year. For the rule of grocery delivery you know we just started that this year and we will scale that to reach about 40% of the U.S. population by the end of the year. So that\u2019s what the reference was in Brett's remarks.","From a GMV growth perspective we really are focused on driving U.S. e-commerce net sales and that's what our targets that we gave are based upon is net sales growth. So we didn\u2019t report on GMV this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Karen Short","One housekeeping then a bigger picture question, just on the Sam's comp, how much do the closures benefit the comp I guess overall traffic comp and then I just another bigger picture question.","Kary Brunner","Sam's Club had a good question, we didn\u2019t call out the specific impact of club closures but we are really pleased with the traffic that we're seeing in our clubs and I think that gets back to having the right merchandise at the right price, so remember couple that with the convenience offerings that we [indiscernible] and other ways to allow the member to get in and out of the club efficiently that\u2019s really our strategy, serve the customer effectively and we are seeing good results from that.","Karen Short","Okay. My real question was just when you look at U.S. operating profit dollars you know the year-over-year numbers kind of not relevant just giving some reallocations but overall the U.S. operating profit dollars came in below our numbers and I would say below consensus. So wondering if U.S. operating profit dollar came in or where they came in relative to your expectations internally?","Kary Brunner","Overall you see drivers of gross profit as well as operating expense leverage and so you know we're not going to speak to what our plans are but as you look at the business we think about the business as we gave guidance in Q4, you know we expect to invest in price and we expect to continue to invest in e-commerce and those will have impacts on the gross margin line as well as the operating expense line. You know we're very focused on operating efficiently and our business, our order business and we're pleased with the progress that they U.S. physical stores had again this quarter. I think this consecutive quarter the expense leverage from our U.S. stores and that really gets back to what we talked about earlier. You know associates leveraging technology and change in processes to make serving customer more effective and efficient and so we're pleased with the direction that we're headed there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Bienvenu","The ticket second consecutive quarter really strong ticket. I'm curious if you could parse out the biggest contributing factors to the ticket strains that will be really helpful.","Kary Brunner","Sure, Ben. Thanks for the question. Again you know there's a number of factors that contribute to that number. Our grocery business has been really strong both on you know the traffic side as well as on tickets with larger baskets more units that business just continues to be very strong. We're particularly pleased with our fresh business and continues to deliver strong comps, it gives back to assortment merchandising and the right prices for the customer and then the other component is our e-commerce business, it is a contributing factor to the growth as well. So nice acceleration from Q4 in e-commerce than Q1 one and that's a contributing factor as well.","Ben Bienvenu","And as a quick follow up here to your grocery question commentary you know another positive comp quarter in the U.S., to what extent are you seeing any inflation in that business. I'm just curious about what you're seeing around cost inflation if you have any?","Kary Brunner","From the cost side we do see, on the sale side it just wasn\u2019t a meaningful impact overall on our comp sales so we didn't call that this quarter but it really gets back to you know manning to the business through different inflationary or deflationary cycles and we've done this for a long time and our merchants are really focused on serving the customer ultimately and inflation and deflation will be what it will be, you know clearly we are focused on every day will cost and every prices and that\u2019s what makes us effective in serving the customer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of [indiscernible] with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","So it makes sense that weather impacted the business for that the latter part of April but it also did coincide with the rise you've seen in gas prices. Can you please tell us how you guys are thinking about the impact of gas prices on both trafficking comps as you think about the balance of the year because it does look like the last big up swing we had in gas prices did seem to have a negative impact on your traffic. Thanks.","Kary Brunner","We certainly watched the rise in gas prices pretty closely, we saw that we cauht it out as a headwind to our gross margin line, as it relates to our own fleet and transportation costs. You know from a customer perspective you know certainly it's something we watch closely as gas prices reach significant levels maybe in the $4 range you can see strip consolidation and things like that. I think the most recent rise in gas prices probably hasn't had a dramatic impact on our Q1 results but its something we will watch closely.","Unidentified Analyst","So the group understands kind of how are you guys thinking about it for the balance of the year, you just kind of assuming that we level off here or just kind of a general trend, that will be helpful. Thanks, guys.","Kary Brunner","We are not going to predict where the rest of the year will go, its something we will watch closely will manage to manage through the cycle whenever it does.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jeffries. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Binder","I was wondering if you could help us understand how membership fee income will be affected this year as a result of this 63 closings -- I realize when they close they don\u2019t immediately fall off but I'm just curious what your assumptions are and how we should think about that membership fee growth?","Kary Brunner","Thanks Dan. We are really focused on adding new members as well as you saw and part of the contributions in Sam's Club business was providing more value with the plus membership and that has allowed members to upgrade to the some plus membership, we're pleased with that and I think as we continue to offer things like the new free shipping offer for plus members on Sam's Club you see members upgrading to the more premium plus level.","Dan Binder","My follow-up question, was there a reason in the adjusted earnings that you didn\u2019t pull out the lease [indiscernible] cost for Sam's and the bank charge you mentioned earlier?","Kary Brunner","Yes, those are all judgment calls and you know ultimately our goal would be not to just out items all the time. So we just called off the large items that we determined we just out quarter, unique items.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Kate McShane","Did you see the same weather impact on general merchandise at Sam's as you did in the Walmart stores in April?","Kary Brunner","Well Sam's business clearly the weather impacts their business as well and as you think about their service to the customer, their categories are a little bit different from a percentage perspective their overall sales relative to the U.S. business and so it wasn't a meaningful call out this quarter.","Kate McShane","Okay. And then my second question is I wondered if there was any way for you to quantify or rank the size of the basket for grocery directory versus pick up versus grocery shopping in-store?","Kary Brunner","Yes so what we have said in the past Kate is that omni-channel customers are really important to us because overall you know their spend if they choose the spend or shop with us in various channels whether it be through pick, whether it be through in-store, online delivery of the home whatever it is if we can get a customer into our ecosystem you know ultimately there's overall spin and that's an in-store customer that's converted since nearly swiped as much and so it's really important to us as its part of our a key part of our overall strategy and you know all in-grocery customers have higher basket sizes than in-store customers do. So you know what's exciting about that is that as you serve a customer effectively through these services where our own personal shoppers are shopping on behalf of a customer, customers are increasingly choosing fresh items in their overall orders which really again speaks to the trust that they have in our shoppers and the job our shoppers are doing on behalf of the customer.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Melich","Just wanted to follow-up on two things, e-commerce we have the growth numbers as we try to back into what it is with percentage of sales now. It looks like it's a little over 3% in the first quarter, is that correct and then the second question is on the cost. You guys talk about cost deleveraging, is the first quarter a good run rate when we think about those incremental costs in technology which I -- it looks like was about a $100 million, is that -- should we expect it should be that sort of year-over-year in each quarter or is that the sort of thing that builds through the year. Thanks, Kary.","Kary Brunner","Yes, it can vary from quarter to quarter. Thanks, Greg. Technology cost can vary from quarter to quarter so couldn\u2019t give you a much help on the go forward but what we have laid out is our priorities for where we're investing and you know as we've said in our last quarter call the opportunity to reinvest some of our tax reform savings into serving the customer through lower prices or investments in e-commerce including the rollout of grocery deliveries throughout the U.S. that we talked about, supply chain, those areas are going to be the areas of focus and so you would see us, those being called out throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","A couple of follow up questions here, first is on the online growth. If you look at the contribution from online grocery on online growth obviously it's a function of the rollout of more stores but what are you seeing in terms of the ramp in the stores with online grocery for more than a year now that you have critical mass. ","Kary Brunner","We are pleased with what we're seeing. You know important components that we talked about a lot is the net promoter score and it continued to remain high, customers are really pleased with the service, we're providing convenience, you think about a young mom with kids who can come to the store at her convenience and pick up her full grocery order with the kids in the SUV in the back within five minutes and not even have to get out of her vehicle and be on her way, it's just very convenient and customers you know really like it. If you think about the overall approach here and the strategy is we're pleased with the metrics that we're seeing and that's why you see a swing and then adding a thousand additional vocations this year.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on the U.S. gross margin been down less than prior quarters, given the pressures that you called out of the investments in transportation costs, it would seem that the offsets were greater this quarter than perhaps in the last couple of quarters, is that right and if so can you elaborate on that and how you're thinking about that for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Kary Brunner","Sure. And again I know we try to point your attention to an annualized gross margin impact number because there is a lot of shifts from quarter to quarter and there's a lot of puts and takes within that gross margin line. Fourth quarter had a number of unique items in it that we talked about now as you think about gross margin in the quarter kind of the same drivers that you've heard us talk about in the past, things like price investment, we've been very clear that we see an opportunity to invest in price and we're pleased with what we're seeing from the strategies been executed over the last couple of years with strong traffic in our stores as well as overall comp growth. Over the last couple of quarter you've seen transportation expenses called out you know somewhat a function of volatility and overall fuel prices then also you know trucking market rate pressures as well. So overall I would just direct your attention to our annualized impacts there can be some noise in the quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Selman [ph] with Chelsey Advisor Group. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","One question again on the quarter, were there any regional trends to call out through the quarter, you know that we've seen presumably weather related or even not, maybe you can share some thoughts on that?","Kary Brunner","We did see impacts as we mentioned from the cooler weather in April in certain general merchandise categories, you think about lawn and garden, you think about sporting goods, some apparel categories saw some head-winds and you know as we analyse the overall business in certain areas like the south and in the West they were less impacted in those regions from weather sensitive categories where they have more normalized weather and so overall the business remains strong we have good momentum in the business and you know both in our stores and through ecommerce we're pleased with where we landed in Q1.","Unidentified Analyst","If I could follow-up on sort of shifting to Europe with the UK, you guys have had some good success there in the past couple of quarters positive comp trends. Is there something you guys figured out relative to all the legal [ph] because I know they continue to gobble up share but you guys have been doing a better job there and again having positive conscience. Is that something you've been doing there that you could also extrapolate and take to the U.S.?","Kary Brunner","If you look at our asset business in the UK, I would remind you that there was some Easter calendar shift that benefited sales and comp this quarter so keep that in mind but we continue to make steady progress and we're investing in price to provide the right value and we're also focused on improving the store experience in the UK so you continue to put that business continue that business on the right trajectory and as far as shared learnings as I talked about earlier on the call you know that's really been something because of our global portfolio we're able to share best practices and for overall future growth across the enterprise.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Noah on for Ed. Just to confirm was the negative impact of weather greater than the Easter benefit and then maybe second have the issues related to the e-commerce distribution centers that you experienced last quarter and totally remediated? Thank you.","Kary Brunner","Sure. So on our U.S. comp business there wouldn't have been any Easter impact there so we called out weather because in certain general merchandise categories due to unseasonably cool temps in April cross country. And what was your second question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, just related to the e-commerce distribution center issues last quarter. Have those been remediated?","Kary Brunner","Yes. We're really focused on serving the customer through not only providing the right assortment and delivering on time but also having the right experience on our site and our site redesign is receiving good reviews from our customers already.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Rupesh Parikh","First on Sam's Club, I was curious how if you look at your closed doors how the retention numbers is going versus your expectations?","Kary Brunner","Yes, Sam's Club has had a good quarter and clearly as we focus on serving the customer effectively in the clubs that are offering you know good assortment and at the right price and providing value to these members are the clubs that we closed just didn't strategically fit into our overall future plans and in the current clubs that we have we're pretty pleased with the result you see strong traffic in our clubs and so there is some there trade off or carryover from some closed clubs.","Rupesh Parikh","And then my second question, as we look at your U.S. e-commerce growth is there any more clarity you can provide on growth rates between grocery and non-grocery or even if you look at whether grocery or non-grocery was a bigger contributor during the quarter to the growth rates?","Kary Brunner","Yes, they really are both contributors to the overall growth rate. We're not going to quantify how much was each but I will tell you they're both important components to driving our overall targets for the year and we've been pleased, we were certainly pleased in Q1 with the 33% that we're able to deliver with contributions from online grocery omni-channel as well as our ship to home business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James.","Bobby Griffin","Just actually on Sam's Club again. Backing off the closed stores can you just give any color on what you're actually seeing from new members sign ups now that you guys have been kind of putting in the work with the merchandising and stuff?","Kary Brunner","Sure I mean I think that's you know as John and the team are focused on drive both new members as well as providing additional value to the customer and plus members we're seeing as we called out the good uptick in plus member sign-ups and I think things like this free shipping offer for Sam's club members plus members is just another example of providing that convenience and the value in that more premium membership. I think about things in making it simple for the member that's another thing it's important, our Scan & Go has been well received allowing the customer to shop on their terms and get in and out of clubs more quickly and even things as simple as the new members sign up process you may have heard John talk about this in October, we've taken steps by leveraging technology to just simplify processes, experiences for customers that are resonating well and you see both growth and membership income as well as in our comp traffic and ticket at Sam's Club. So overall another good quarter for Sam's.","Bobby Griffin","All right. And then lastly just to help us from a modelling standpoint, it was touched on earlier but I don\u2019t think we got the full answer, a 140 basis point impact this quarter from tobacco the original guidance we've spoken to last quarter is maybe 400 or so based upon on headwinds, how should we think about that headwind progressing through the rest of the year on Sam's Club comp?","Kary Brunner","Just keep in mind that was full year guidance and so you now we're not updating that today, we will provide an update on certain full year guidance metrics in our next quarter release but just keep in mind that's full year and there could be you know varying impacts throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. We've come to the conclusion of our question and answer session today. This will also conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"21666":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

We believe the presentation provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons.

It is worth noting that last Wednesday, we opened our 5,000 unit in the United States, a Neighborhood Market in Greenbriar, Arkansas.","In the Walmart U.S. discussion today, we refer to traditional Neighborhood Markets, which are grocery stores that average 43,000 square feet and include a pharmacy. The smaller Neighborhood Markets we refer to are those ranging in size from 12,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet and are what we formerly called Walmart Express stores.

Doug?","Doug McMillon","Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Walmart reported solid earnings per share of $1.15 in the third quarter, and our consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion over the same period last year to $118.1 billion. I\u2019m encouraged that Walmart U.S. reported a positive comp for the quarter and that our Neighborhood Market stores continued to show strong sales. Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s and International\u2019s operating income grew faster than sales growth, and global e-commerce sales increased about 21%. But we need to continue to improve the customer experience both in our stores and online to deliver stronger sales growth and strengthen our bottom line performance.","Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. added $2.3 billion in net sales. Since the beginning of this year, you\u2019ve heard me say that our focus was on delivering a positive comp by year-end. I\u2019m encouraged that comp sales were positive in Q3, but we are still not satisfied. We have areas to improve, including in the customer experience and in our price leadership position and we are taking the steps necessary to fix these areas. Greg and the leadership team are intensely committed to driving short-term improvement through the urgent agenda items and he will share an update on this important work.","Operating income declined due to increased healthcare expenses, investments in e-commerce, and investments in price. Walmart U.S. appeals to customers across all income levels, and they all want to get the best value. Our Savings Catcher program continues to help us reach more of these value-driven customers. The cost relief from lower fuel prices presents a potential benefit for customers and could continue to help them during this holiday shopping season in addition to helping our own business.","Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong operating income growth this quarter, due primarily to an increase in membership income and expense leverage. We would like to see stronger sales, but I\u2019m encouraged by the progress in membership and the strong pace of renewals by our Plus Members. Members are responding to our ongoing investments in merchandise and in services, as well as the overall membership value proposition.","Walmart International turned in a solid performance, growing operating income faster than sales, one of our key metrics. I\u2019m especially pleased by the sales improvements this quarter in Canada, both sequentially and over last year. The investments we\u2019ve made to remodel our stores and drive supercentre expansion are resonating with customers. During the quarter, I traveled to Asia to see how things are progressing in China and Japan. In a supercenter in Beijing, customers shared how they appreciate the quality of our fresh meats and produce. I got a kick out of watching our associates show our Chinese customers how to use avocados to make guacamole. The world is shrinking right before our eyes.","While our customer feedback in China is improving, one customer when asked what we could do better, mentioned she can sometimes find diapers and formula cheaper online. Customers all over the world are integrating how they shop. They don\u2019t see the same lines of separation some of us might focus on and this is a great opportunity for Walmart. Increasingly, we are seeing it just how they do. In Japan, our customers are responding to value. It\u2019s clear why our comp sales have been better when you walk these stores and see the items and prices. Our fresh food in Japan looks great.","Last week, I dropped into some stores in Chicago including a new Neighborhood Market in an urban area. A customer stopped me to thank us for the value we\u2019ve brought to his community and it was interesting for me to see some of the similarities and differences of our fresh food offer compared to what I\u2019d seen in Japan. We are learning across markets and can do even more of that to improve our fresh offering in all of our markets. It\u2019s a key point in our enterprise strategy going forward. In that same store, another customer strongly encouraged us to add more organic produce. She was right; we needed more. We\u2019re seeing opportunities large and small to get better.","Interactions like this often remind me how similar our customers are around the world. Everyone is interested in getting quality products at a value. Walmart makes a difference in people\u2019s lives. From a customer perspective, the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred. For me, it was another reminder of the great opportunity we have to use our 11,000 stores and digital capabilities globally to save our customers money and time. With our goal of greater access and an improved customer experience, we are strengthening our e-commerce and mobile capabilities. This is an investment period for Walmart, which can create short-term turbulence in service and impacts our e-commerce sales.","This quarter, we saw solid e-commerce growth from our key markets and we are pleased with the progress in markets like Mexico and Canada. We continue to roll out our new global technology platform to provide streamlined search and navigation functionality. And, construction continues on our new fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Brazil. I\u2019m excited about all the opportunity we will have to serve customers in new and better ways as we get these global e-commerce capabilities fully installed.","As you heard at our Annual Investor Meeting last month, we are focused on an enterprise strategy designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for our customers. It\u2019s what they want and we will give it to them. This strategy includes four customer dimensions: price, assortment, experience and access. Being the price leader across a broad basket of goods is important because value conscious customers from all income demographics around the world want to save money. We\u2019re also focused on having the right assortment, both in store and online.","Our customers want to be able to buy just about anything from us, so we are expanding our e-commerce assortment to give them that opportunity. In the area of service, we\u2019re investing to provide a shopping experience at Walmart that exceeds customer expectations. For access, we are developing the capabilities to save our customers time and give them the choices they want by integrating digital and physical retail in ways that are convenient for what they want at that moment.","The way these four dimensions come together represents our plan to win. We\u2019ll be able to give customers what they want and how they want it. We\u2019re thankful to be able to continue our progress addressing challenges in key areas of global responsibility. We have a great team of associates. Walmart creates a ladder of opportunity for each of us. We promote a lot of associates each year to jobs of greater responsibility and higher pay. Whether your job is to serve customers in Beijing, Tokyo or Chicago, you can grow in your role and build a career at Walmart.","In our communities around the world, I\u2019m pleased that both our customers and associates will help make the holidays and the New Year brighter for those less fortunate. Through partnerships with organizations like CARE, Salvation Army, Feeding America and Operation Homefront, Walmart is giving back to the communities we serve. As I close my remarks, let me reiterate that I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter. Saving people money and time drives our decisions. The future looks bright for Walmart. We\u2019re making the necessary changes and moving with appropriate speed to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot","Thanks, Doug. I\u2019ll cover results of the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation released today as a part of the earnings transcript. Total revenue for the quarter exceeded $119 billion, as consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, or 2.8% along with membership and other income growth of 13.9%. Consolidated operating expenses increased 3.5%, primarily due to continued investments in wages and higher U.S. healthcare-related expenses. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $41 million, which represents approximately $30 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations and approximately $11 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $69 million for the third quarter. Through the third quarter of this year, we have spent $137 million on FCPA and compliance-related costs versus our guidance of between $200 and $240 million. We expect to be near the low end of the guidance for the full-year.","As you may see on Slides 2 and 3, net interest expense increased 13.1% for the quarter. This is primarily the result of the reclassification of certain store leases from operating to capital. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 31.8%, below our previous guidance of around 34% due to certain discrete tax matters. So while we benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate than anticipated, this benefit was offset by a number of discrete charges. In addition to the capital lease interest charges, we had some unique operating expenses in the quarter, which include organizational restructuring charges in the UK and Hurricane Odile losses in Mexico. Dave will discuss those later.","From a balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 3.7%. Later in today\u2019s call, you will hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 77.0%, which compares to 79% last year due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority. I will conclude today with a comment about returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued investment in store growth and e-commerce initiatives. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?","Greg Foran","Thank you, Claire. Over my first 100 days, I\u2019ve been visiting our stores and competition across the country and evaluating the U.S. business landscape. I\u2019ve spent time with our frontline associates and leadership teams, and I\u2019m encouraged by what I see. There are some areas where we really are excelling and our performance reflects this. However, I still know we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. To summarize the U.S. business as I see it today, comps have improved, but sales and operating cost headwinds remain, impacting both top and bottom line performance.","We will partially offset these headwinds in the fourth quarter by making progress on the urgent agenda items that I presented at the Investor Meeting last month. We have opportunities to become better shopkeepers, to execute the everyday business better. And finally, we are developing long-term plans for the business. These actions will take time, but I believe they will make us a stronger business, and allow us to sustainably grow beyond our fair share of opportunity.","Now, let\u2019s turn to this quarter\u2019s performance. Net sales grew $2.3 billion, or 3.4%. For the 13-week period ended October 31, comparable sales were up 0.5%. This is the first positive comp for the Walmart U.S. business in seven quarters despite approximately 70 basis points of impact from SNAP-related headwinds. Ticket was up 1.2%, while traffic declined 0.7%. Note that traffic improved 40 basis points from Q2 and 70 basis points from Q1. Within the business, we\u2019ve had several areas driving top line growth. First, we\u2019re encouraged by sales performance during key seasonal events. We started the quarter with a strong back-to-school program across categories in apparel, home, and traditional back-to-school supplies. And we ended the quarter well, executing a strong Halloween event. This led to positive performance in seasonal categories, including costumes, seasonal d\u00e9cor, and candy.","Throughout the quarter, we experienced comp sales growth in home and apparel, driven by newness across the categories. We have a strong good\/better\/best strategy, accented by strong brands, which translated into positive results. Health and wellness continued to be a bright spot for us driven by double-digit branded drug inflation and script count growth, due to the more preferred Medicare plans. OTC was also strong in categories, such as pain management and seasonal allergy.","Within store formats, we are pleased by the Neighborhood Market performance particularly in our traditional format, which reported approximately a 5.5% positive comp for the quarter. Pharmacy and consumables continued to produce strong growth, as we focused on in-stock and optimizing the store with relevant offerings for the customer. In our e-commerce business, we are being thoughtful about sustainable growth in this channel. E-commerce, including store-fulfilled sales, contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp. Whilst our comp performance shows some progress, we still have opportunity to improve.","Our overall grocery comp, which includes food and consumables was relatively flat. Net inflation increased approximately 210 basis points versus last year, primarily led by meat and dairy. Offsetting the majority of this inflation were SNAP-related headwinds and customers trading down in high-inflation categories. In the key category of food, consumables, and OTC, we gained a small increase in market share for the 13 weeks ended October 25, according to The Nielsen Company.","Entertainment had a high single-digit negative comp. This was driven by industry softness and deflation and further compounded by lapping major releases last year in video games and movies. Additionally, a delayed launch in our wireless systems capabilities impacted our ability to offer mobile handset installment plans. We expect these systems to be in place in Q4. We are, however, encouraged by early results from the recent relay of the entertainment department and have seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in key categories.","Overall, I would characterize the quarter\u2019s sales performance as mixed. Whilst I\u2019m encouraged by several emerging trends and I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about our Q4 top line performance, I know we have additional work to improve down our side counters and within our everyday business. Shifting to the remainder of our financial results, gross profit rate declined 22 basis points. This was driven primarily by pharmacy cost inflation and reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates. Additionally, we\u2019ve continued price investment in key categories such as meat and preferred Medicare plans in pharmacy.","Operating expenses were primarily impacted by higher healthcare- related costs versus last year. Additionally, we were purposeful not to overextend wage leverage, while focusing on improving customer service. Overall, operating expenses deleveraged 10 basis points and coupled with the decline in gross margin rates and ongoing investments in e-commerce led to a 1.2% decrease in operating income.","Let\u2019s move next to inventory, which was up 5.2% at the end of Q3. More than half of this was due to new store growth and a conscious decision to flow inventory through our diversified import network early for the upcoming holiday season. This allowed us to minimize risk of delays and mitigate impact to our holiday business. We\u2019ve taken recent actions with respect to reducing inventory, but it\u2019s too early to see any significant impact. However, we are reasonably confident that we will see an improvement in inventory levels over the next year.","Now, let me discuss our real estate actions this quarter. We opened 49 supercenters, including 33 new and 16 conversions, as well as 28 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets in Q3. In Q4, we will shift to a heavier mix of small formats, opening over 100 traditional Neighborhood Markets and 70 smaller ones. Given the significant number of Q4 openings, we expect headwinds related to pre-opening expenses, as well as higher inventory balances from these openings.","Shifting gears now, I would like to talk a little about Q4. I\u2019m encouraged by our momentum on the urgent agenda items. We\u2019re already seeing improvements in how we execute markdowns related to damaged merchandise, particularly in produce, as we focus on improving freshness for our customers. Plans are emerging to deliver a strong in-stock position, while simultaneously managing inventory levels appropriately. Though profit will remain challenged, we are working to partially offset some of the expressed headwinds.","For the holiday season, I\u2019m excited by what I see in our stores. Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and we are prepared to make it a great day for our customers and their families. As we revealed this week, we are excited for The New Black Friday at Walmart. This year, we\u2019ll have five days of fantastic deals and tailored events, including the return of our industry-exclusive one-hour Guarantee program. We have the most popular toys, thanks to our Chosen by Kids program, and we continue to provide customers with easy ways to purchase everything they need for the holidays, including ordering online for pick up in store and a free layaway program with no opening fees. We will also have exciting offers both in-store and online for Cyber Monday, as we deliver an integrated digital and physical experience.","I\u2019d like to personally thank all of our 1.2 million strong associates, who are engaged and energized for the season. This year our associates will be easy to spot, as they wear their Walmart vests with pride. Additionally, we will hire more than 60,000 additional seasonal associates to help provide great customer service, and we will implement our Checkout Promise, ensuring more registers are open than ever before. All of these actions will reinforce the levels of service our customers need and appreciate.","As we enter the fourth quarter, we see both opportunities and challenges ahead of us. We lapped the approximately 6% reduction in SNAP benefits on November 1. Additionally, gas prices are considerably lower this year than a year ago, which may give customers a little more discretionary spending power in the coming months. And as I just discussed, we are enthused by our holiday plans across the box and online. However, we expect this holiday season to be highly competitive, and we are mindful that the entertainment business, which comprises a larger percentage of overall Q4 sales is up against continued deflation and a lack of new product innovation. We\u2019ll continue to see pressures to the bottom line as we balance wage leverage with higher customer service standards.","We recognize we have opportunities to improve the business, but we also know that these things will take time to ensure that they are executed properly and in the best interest of our customers. We continue to work hard on longer-term plans, and I know that by being purposeful in our actions, we will come out stronger, gaining more than our fair share of the opportunity. For these reasons, we expect comp sales in the fourth quarter to be between flat and positive 1% for the 13-week period ending January 30, 2015. Last year, Walmart\u2019s comp sales declined 0.4% for the 14-week period ended January 31, 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for the International update. Dave?","David Cheesewright","Thank you, Greg. Overall, we had a solid third quarter, once again growing operating income faster than sales and gaining market share in most of our largest markets. While sales growth slowed some on a constant currency basis compared with the first-half of the year, sales trends improved in the latter part of the quarter in markets such as Canada and Mexico. Customers remain challenged across most of the globe, but our teams continue to do a great job of serving these customers by helping them save time and money.","The team is aligned on key strategies that we discussed in the October Investor Meeting. We\u2019re making significant progress on driving price leadership and widening or maintaining our price gap across key markets. We\u2019re excited about steps we\u2019ve taken this quarter to accelerate growth in e-commerce, including the launch of additional online offerings in Mexico and China and collection points for online customers in the U.K. and China. We also remain focused on being the most trusted retailer wherever we operate. For example, Walmart China recently launched a Worry Free Fresh program starting with 49 stores providing our customers with a money-back satisfaction guarantee when buying fresh produce and meats.","On October 30, we announced the future closing of around 30 underperforming stores in Japan that will allow us to continue to focus on the key elements of the business, such as e-commerce, price leadership, and fresh. While these decisions are never taken lightly, we will continuously assess our portfolio of businesses to ensure that we are focusing our efforts on the things that matter most to our shareholders and customers.","Though there is always room for improvement, we feel good about our third quarter results. Net sales grew 2.9% on a constant currency basis or 1.7% on a reported basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 5.2% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% on a reported basis. We did not leverage expenses for the quarter in part due to continued investments in e-commerce and other initiatives, but leveraging expenses remains a key priority. On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance in most countries, which we will discuss further in the individual market sections.","Of our five largest countries, Canada, Brazil and Mexico delivered positive comp sales, but comps declined in the U.K. and China due to retail deflationary pressures. Net sales and comp growth were strong in some of our other markets, including Africa, Argentina, Central America, Chile, and Japan. We made some progress in reducing inventory levels during the quarter, dropping from 11.2% year-over-year growth in Q2 to 7.2% in Q3. While we are encouraged by the improvements made in some of our key markets, we still have work to do.","Now, let\u2019s discuss individual results for key markets. Net sales growth and comp sales are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 8 and 9 of the presentation summarize financial details. The UK market remained challenging throughout the quarter. Aggressive competitive activity resulted in an overall market decline over the 12 weeks ended October 12, according to Kantar. In this environment, Asda continued to perform relatively strongly and was the only one of the big 4 grocers to gain share this quarter. Comp sales declined 1.8%, excluding fuel. Supermarkets performed ahead of expectations, and we saw success in George home categories and Click and Collect which we continue to expand aggressively.","Operating income grew ahead of sales due to favorability in margin and other income. We did not leverage expenses due to lower sales and some organizational restructuring costs taken during the quarter. In Canada, we accelerated growth versus the first-half of this year, with comp sales growing 0.6% and net sales up 3.3%. Fresh performed particularly well, with double-digit growth due to our increased grocery presence via new and converted stores. General merchandise sales also improved versus Q2 driven by entertainment. In an increasingly competitive environment, Canada gained 20 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12-week period ended October 18. Canada grew operating income 3.5%, outpacing sales growth. We leveraged operating expenses 9 basis points through continued focus on lowering costs.","Moving next to Walmex, which released their quarterly results on October 17. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP; thus some numbers will differ. Consolidated Walmex sales grew 4.2% with positive comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Walmex operating income decreased 10.4% due to approximately $25 million in expenses related to the effects of Hurricane Odile in August.","Mexico sales grew 4.2%, and comp sales were up 0.6% for the quarter outperforming the industry. Excluding Sam\u2019s Club, self-service outperformed the market by 250 basis points and gained share across our main store divisions according to ANTAD. Grocery comps exceeded the market by 340 basis points, and general merchandise increased 150 basis points. In addition, our small format, Bodega Aurrera Express, outperformed its market peers with a 12.6% comp for the quarter. We maintained a solid price position and attractive assortment, which we believe will help us win in the fourth quarter.","We remain focused on turnaround efforts in our Mexico Sam\u2019s Clubs. Our success will depend on building our membership base and establishing a strong foundation for the future. This quarter, I\u2019m happy to report progress against some of our key objectives with positive member base growth each month of Q3, and reduced inventory. We still have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m pleased that we are seeing some progress.","As mentioned earlier, the Baja region of Mexico was significantly impacted by Hurricane Odile. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the Walmex associates and Walmart de Mexico\u2019s Foundation stepped up to support the local community providing 60 tons of food to the Mexican Red Cross and opening collection centers in our stores in several states of Mexico. Walmex also provided support to affected associates.","Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil. Despite an overall economic deceleration in Q3, comp sales grew 0.8%, with net sales down 0.7%, as a result of closing underperforming stores last year. Despite the overall sales decline, the management team continued to make great progress on reducing operating expenses, resulting in operating income improvement. We remain focused on strengthening the business in Brazil by building a business model that is simple, scalable and profitable. We restructured leadership teams where necessary and enacted process changes in merchandising to leverage local market knowledge when making decisions. Store integration progress continued, with the recent completion of the conversion of all stores in South Brazil to unified systems and processes. These actions helped drive the comp sales growth, expense savings, and profit improvement so far this year.","Moving to China. Walmart China\u2019s Q3 net sales declined 0.8% and comp sales declined 2.3%. Sales remain challenged as we, along with all retailers, continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity, reduction in gift card sales, and deflation in key categories such as dry grocery, liquor, and consumables. Despite the top line challenges, Walmart China grew sales at a faster pace than the market in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended September 30, according to Nielsen.","Walmart China also made great progress in strengthening the core of the business. Initiatives to increase supply chain centralization by adding fresh and grocery distribution centers will be completed by the end of this year. Centralization reduces shipping costs, enhances quality of fresh products, improves inventory management and delivers goods to stores more timely. Walmart China\u2019s operating income was flat with last year. We anticipate continued sales pressure in China for the fourth quarter from deflation and government austerity measures, as well as from the timing of Chinese New Year, which will fall nearly three weeks later than in the current year.","Finally, let\u2019s discuss our progress in e-commerce across the globe. Accelerating e-commerce growth is a key priority and future growth will depend on innovation and driving grocery home shopping. The third quarter marked the launch of online grocery delivery sales in the greater Mexico City area, and the pilot of a third-party online OTC pharmacy site in China that\u2019s part of Yihaodian\u2019s offering.","In the UK, e-commerce sales were up 20%. We provided more convenience for customers through the Click and Collect rollout, with a record 148 new locations opening this quarter, including six additional London tube stations. Ongoing price investments drove strong grocery home shopping sales growth of 18.6%, despite annualizing against significant growth last year. Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China had strong sales growth. Traffic increased more than 40% and average ticket improved as well. Consumer electronics drove growth with strong performances in wireless and appliances, and the third quarter was highlighted by Yihaodian\u2019s Anniversary Sale with sales increasing more than 50% compared to last year\u2019s event.","In Brazil, e-commerce sales grew strongly again. As a result of closer partnerships with key suppliers such as Sony PlayStation and Electrolux appliances, sales in games and home nearly doubled. In addition, focused marketing on new moms in the baby categories contributed to strong consumables growth. The August Black-Out Event, a Black Friday-like promotional event was a great success. The event was more than twice as large as last year with six TVs, seven mobile phones, and one Xbox 360 sold every minute.","We were also pleased with e-commerce results in Mexico, as online sales grew 66% over last year albeit off a fairly low base. The new grocery delivery option offers 30,000 items from 14 categories, including fresh, dry grocery, consumables and pharmacy, and caters to customers of 75 stores in and around Mexico City. Orders can be picked up in store or delivered. We\u2019re also making significant investments in talent, marketing, technology and fulfillment. We saw encouraging results in general merchandise, where almost 20% of our sales are done through 150 kiosks at Walmart Supercenters, giving customers who feel more confident ordering and paying in stores an attractive alternative to paying online.","We remain committed to our key initiatives in order to deliver a solid fourth quarter performance. The market teams have exciting plans in place to serve our customers better than ever. For example, in Mexico, where we have a very strong presence in toys, we are offering a double price guarantee on toys sold during the Christmas season. In Japan, we will stock the shelves with popular Fortune Bags, similar to grab bags, in preparation for the New Year holiday, giving customers a surprise for a great value. We remain optimistic about our ability to serve our customers around the world, and in continuing to deliver solid results.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thanks Dave. Sam\u2019s Club delivered strong profit growth this quarter with operating income up 5.3% without fuel and 12% with fuel. We\u2019ve continued to execute strategic investments in membership, merchandise newness, and the intersection of digital and physical. Sam\u2019s posted a comp increase without fuel of 40 basis points for the 13-week period ended October 31. We\u2019re pleased that this growth represents a cumulative improvement of 90 basis points over the 39-week period.","Although we have lapped our fiscal year 2014 fee increase, our third quarter membership income growth remained strong at 10.1%. Clearly, our members have continued to respond positively to our efforts to enhance membership value. Since June 2014, the launch of Cash Rewards has improved our Plus penetration by about 4 percentage points. Additionally, our operators have really gotten behind our 5:3:1 cash-back MasterCard, which is not only chip-enabled to protect our members from fraud, but also stands as the best cash-back program in the market today. Along with instant savings, these programs speak to our commitment that a Sam\u2019s Club membership is the most valuable card in the members\u2019 wallets.","Now, let me review our financial results and highlights from the quarter, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. In Q3, comp sales increased 0.4% driven by relatively balanced growth in traffic and ticket. Traffic remains up among the Savings members, with pressure from fewer trips within our Business members. Retail inflation across the club averaged low single-digits with inflation higher in certain areas such as dairy and meat, offset by deflation in other areas, including technology.","Net sales grew 2.3% to $12.7 billion, and operating income grew 5.3% to $455 million. Our gross profit rate declined 43 basis points this quarter with a significant portion attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. This pressure will continue as Plus member penetration grows. Similar to Q2, mix also contributed to the decline. We leveraged this quarter, as operating expenses grew slower than sales by 35 basis points. This has been largely due to lower remodel costs and pre-opening expenses with four clubs, including expansions, opening this quarter compared to 13 during last year. However, healthcare-related expenses were higher year-over-year.","Membership and other income grew 9.9%. Plus member renewals and upgrades were strong, offsetting softness in the business member base. Lower oil prices contributed to higher fuel profit of $38 million. Consistent with industry trends, Sam\u2019s Club sees fuel profits increase as oil prices fall, and decrease as oil prices rise. In both scenarios, we provide significant member value through our gas stations, not only giving members the best price per gallon, but also an additional 5% off all gas purchases through our Sam\u2019s Club MasterCard. This year, we\u2019ve been working to bring inventory growth in line with sales growth and we saw results. An increase of 1.3% with fuel, an improvement since last quarter reflects better inventory flow. Bringing in on-trend newness in key categories has brought our merchandise to life this quarter.","Let me give you a few examples. There is great work in newness going on across our food business. Both areas grocery\/beverage and fresh\/freezer\/cooler delivered positive low single-digit comps. We have significantly expanded our organic portfolio this quarter, and plan to more than double it by the end of the year. Other new items such as Chia Seeds, breakfast bars, and squeezable fruit pouches hit on key trends, healthy, on the go, and exciting, and members have responded.","In freezer, convenient frozen meats, fruits, seafood, and vegetables have shown strength as well, appealing to our members\u2019 desire to save both time and money. Similar to last quarter, inflation in dairy and meat remained particularly in red meat, where we\u2019ve seen members shift to value items such as chicken and ground beef. Additionally, produce results have been mixed due to a stone fruit recall, deflation in potatoes, and weather shocks that pressured various items in the category.","For our members, newness is also about excitement. In home, apparel, hardlines, which posted a positive low single-digit comp, we have updated the calendar to fill in some of the gaps between major seasonal events. Our home event in August and early set of holiday merchandise in September impressed members and reinforced Sam\u2019s Club as a holiday shopping destination. Apparel, including our exclusive active wear brands, children\u2019s wear, and fall outerwear continued to generate excitement as well. Health and wellness accelerated this quarter delivering a positive mid single-digit comp driven by both script growth and inflation from the brand and generic mix. Members truly see Sam\u2019s Club as a trusted source for healthcare needs from pharmacy to health screenings to healthy-for-you products.","I\u2019m particularly delighted that our pharmacy teams have been recognized by an industry research firm as the number one provider of pharmacy services amongst mass merchandisers. Our continued momentum in pharmacy is clear evidence of this well-deserved recognition. Over-the-counter was boosted by healthy-for-you protein products, including protein powder and protein drinks, which appeal to our members\u2019 active lifestyles. So as you can see, newness is working across categories and we are working even faster to infuse newness in other areas of the business as well.","Comp sales of consumables, which declined low single-digits is an area where we are working to improve results. While tabletop and bags continued to perform well due to pack size expansion and strategic pricing. The consumables category was pressured by inventory issues in our private label pet business, as well as a recall in baby wipes. Technology, entertainment and office comps declined high single-digit comps, but showed improved performance in the wireless category, compared to last quarter. Specifically, a strong Apple 6\/6+ launch, and the implementation of new technology to process members\u2019 wireless contracts supported this improved wireless performance. Our merchants are focused on consumer electronics, which will keep our momentum going through the holiday season.","Ancillary, which includes tobacco was essentially flat for this quarter. While still down year-over-year, the improvement from Q2 is due to unit growth in tobacco driven in part by shifts in the competitive landscape. Our online business continued to perform, demonstrating our progress in furthering the integration of digital and physical. Samsclub.com contributed approximately 20 basis points to the total segment comp by means of its double-digit sales growth in both direct-to-home and Club Pickup, as well as improved conversion rates from across most access points.","I\u2019m proud of the progress our teams have made to integrate the digital and physical. This October, we launched Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull, rebranding it as Club Pickup, to make it that much easier for members to shop with us just in time for the holiday season. It\u2019s a service that our Business members have always loved and now we are expanding it to appeal to all members. From the online Easy Reorder tool to new check-in kiosks at all clubs, members can complete a trip to Sam\u2019s Club in a matter of minutes. What\u2019s more, Club Pickup is yet another touch point for our members to experience legendary member service both in-club and online.","What I find really encouraging is our reengagement with the Business member through a suite of services that help our small business members save money and time on vital day-to-day business needs. For example, we know that only a small fraction of microbusinesses is able to fund employees\u2019 healthcare insurance, instead relying on outside benefits or paying out-of-pocket. Now, our small business members can provide employees with affordable health care plans through the Aetna Marketplace for Sam\u2019s Club.","Furthermore, they also have a trusted source for legal solutions from LegalZoom as well as payroll services, merchant payment processing, and travel booking. And we believe that savings members will also take advantage of some of these services, especially the travel. The digital foundation supporting this is the Samsclub.com platform. Our team released significant new features this quarter. Desktop site enhancements, unit price visibility, and smooth integration for third-party services have further improved the platform\u2019s ability to migrate members online, and guide them through the browsing and purchasing process.","I\u2019m proud of our recent accomplishments at Sam\u2019s Club and even more thrilled about the growth to come in our clubs and online. In the fourth quarter, we will lap last year\u2019s headwinds from SNAP reductions and severe weather impacts. We expect comp sales to be between flat and up 2% for the 13-week period ending January 30, excluding fuel. This compares to a decline of 0.1% last year. When you come visit us in the club this holiday season, you will see our focus on delivering newness across the box. Our merchants and operators are excited about our holiday plan and poised to deliver strong results to close out the year. It all begins in just two days with our November 15 Holiday Savings Celebration, so I hope to see you out in the clubs.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Charles. Charles?","Charles Holley","Thanks, Roz. Overall, we are encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. We continued to focus on driving stronger sales and improving customer service. Let me summarize the key takeaways from the third quarter. Earnings per share of $1.15 were at the midpoint of our guidance. Walmart U.S. delivered its first positive comp in seven quarters. Consolidated net sales increased $3.2 billion, with Walmart U.S. contributing $2.3 billion of the increase.","Walmart International once again grew operating income faster than sales, and we gained market share in most of our largest markets despite the economic conditions in those markets. Sam\u2019s Club delivered operating income growth of 5% without fuel, due to stronger membership income. E-commerce sales grew approximately 21% on a global basis and we made initial progress on working capital management an ongoing priority for all of our finance teams.","Now, let\u2019s move on to guidance for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. Our earnings guidance today assumes several important factors, including the economic conditions in several of our largest markets and a highly promotional holiday season, especially in the U.S. As a reminder, our full-year earnings per share guidance includes the four factors we discussed last quarter, which were higher than anticipated healthcare costs in the U.S., incremental investments in e-commerce, ongoing investments in Sam\u2019s Club, and our effective tax rate, which we expect to range between 32 to 34%.","Last quarter, we shared that the incremental investment in e-commerce for fiscal 2015 is expected to range between $0.05 and $0.07 per share. Year-to-date, we have incurred approximately $0.04 per share of the incremental investment. On October 15, at our Investor Meeting, we also shared with you that we plan to step up our investments again next fiscal year given the priorities we have for digital and mobile commerce in our enterprise strategy.","As I indicated last quarter, while historically our tax rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. It\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. In particular we are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full-year.","Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $1.46 and $1.56. This range includes approximately $0.03 per share related to the previously announced closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. In addition, remember we will have continued headwinds from healthcare expenses as well as the remainder of our incremental investment in e-commerce. As a reminder, last year, Walmart reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.34, which included a negative impact of approximately $0.26 from discrete items. Therefore last year\u2019s fourth quarter underlying earnings per share were $1.60.","With that, let\u2019s move on to guidance for the full-year. As we indicated at the recent Analyst Meeting, we now anticipate net sales growth for fiscal 2015 to range between 2% and 3% versus our prior guidance of being at the low end of our stated range of 3% to 5%. And as of today, we would expect foreign currency to have a negative impact for the full-year of more than $4 billion. In addition, today we are updating our guidance for full-year earnings per share to range between $4.92 and $5.02. This revised guidance includes approximately $0.03 per share of charges related to the closure of underperforming stores in Walmart Japan. This compares to our prior guidance of $4.90 to $5.15.","Last year, we reported full-year earnings per share of $4.85, which included the $0.26 of discrete items I mentioned earlier. Therefore our full-year underlying earnings per share last year were $5.11. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We paid $1.5 billion in dividends this quarter and spent approximately $82 million to repurchase our shares. It is clear that our operating results influence our cash flows. Our cash position will improve as we have better performance from our U.S. operations and improve working capital management.","Our entire team is focused on being disciplined in delivering for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. And on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host Steve Schmitt with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Steve Schmitt.","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Walmart's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. Joining us on today's call are Walmart President and CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, Brett Biggs. Doug and Brett will have some opening remarks in a minute, and then we'll take your questions. We'll do our best to get to as many of you as possible.","We're excited to be hosting this call today. You may have seen in our press release announcing this call that we've made a process change to have a live earnings call with executives in conjunction with our fourth quarter results going forward.","It feels appropriate that we share our thoughts as we wrap up one year and begin another. Also, this timing is well spaced from our June and October meetings. We plan to follow our typical earnings release process for other quarters during our fiscal year.","Now before I turn the call over to Doug, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will include forward-looking statements.

Please review our entire safe harbor statement and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com.","And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Doug McMillon.","Doug McMillon","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We just completed an exciting year with solid fourth quarter results and continued momentum in the business. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue grew approximately 3% both in the quarter and for the full year. We reached more than $500 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2018 for the first time as a company.","For the quarter, Walmart U.S. delivered strong comp sales growth of 2.6% due primarily to improved comp traffic growth in stores of 1.6%. Strength was broad-based across merchandising categories, formats and regions, and holiday sales were solid. In addition, comp store inventory declined again for the 11th consecutive quarter so we're well positioned as we begin the year.","Sam's Club comps improved to 2.4%, and in International, 9 of 11 markets posted positive comp sales. So overall, we were pleased with most aspects of the quarter and confident in the foundational aspects of the business as we enter this new fiscal year.","Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales growth in the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 50% in the third quarter. The majority of this slowdown was expected as we fully lapped the Jet acquisition, as well as created a healthier long-term foundation for holiday. A smaller portion of the slowdown was unexpected as we experienced some operational challenges that negatively impacted growth.","Overall, we finished the year with eCommerce sales growth of more than 40%, so we feel better about the year than the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect eCommerce growth to increase from the fourth quarter level as we enter the New Year with about 40% growth for the year.","We're confident in our strategy to transform the company, and we continue to be guided by four key objectives: make every day easier for busy families, change how we work, deliver results and operate with discipline and be the most trusted retailer.","We're accelerating innovation in the business to make shopping faster and easier for our customers. Creativity, decisiveness and speed are priorities. We made good progress this past year to save busy families time and money, and we'll do more.","By becoming stronger at mobile and leveraging digital capabilities, we improved in-store experiences, including our pharmacy and money services areas. We enabled Easy Reorder online. We're making the checkout experience easier with Scan & Go and also digitizing the returns process.","We made acquisitions to improve our online assortment, and we're partnering with others like Google and JD in new ways. We're expanding Online Grocery in the U.S. and around the world and broadening our delivery capabilities in the U.S., China and other international markets.","It's really all about providing more convenience for customers. Customers that shop across all channels are important to us. As we said in October, U.S. customers that shop us in-store and online spend nearly twice as much as customers that only shop with us in stores. Their loyalty to Walmart strengthens overall.","Online Grocery customers are a great example as they spend more with us in total once they start using the service. So we'll lean in this year by nearly doubling the number of Online Grocery locations in the U.S.","We're also becoming more efficient by changing the way we work, including leveraging technology to equip and empower our associates to be successful. They now have better information, tools and training.","Finally, we're always striving to earn and maintain trust. We're focused on not only helping our customers save money and live better but also on creating shared value for our business and the communities we serve.","In his remarks, Brett will go over the financials and guidance. This will include an overview of the benefits of tax reform and the strategic choices we're making to further strengthen our business.","Tax reform gives us the opportunity to accelerate plans for the U.S. You may have seen our announcement last month about investing some of the proceeds in better wages and benefits for more than 1 million U.S. hourly associates. We'll also continue to lower prices for customers, improve technology in our business and accelerate grocery delivery in the United States.","Now let's get into more details for the segments, and I'll start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong year of top line growth, and we're seeing signs that the productivity loop is turning. In our stores, we're making shopping easier and equipping associates to serve customers more efficiently.","In the fourth quarter, we took steps to restructure our store leadership teams and corporate support areas to be more nimble. We're becoming more efficient, and it's contributing to the expense leverage that physical stores have delivered all year.","Beginning this week, we increased the U.S. starting hourly wage rate to $11. We're also proud to announce adoption benefits for associates that went into effect earlier this month in addition to expanded paid parental leave for all associates that will take effect in March. Investing in our associates will help us attract and retain talent in the future.","In addition, we've invested in nearly 200 training academies that have further developed the retail skills of more than 250,000 associates. So our stores are executing better. We\u2019re innovating more. We\u2019re lowering prices and customers are responding with higher sales and traffic. As I mentioned earlier this has also been a year of good progress in ecommerce. We launched free 2-day shipping on Walmart.com, and customers continue to love Online Grocery pickup. We're expanding our test of same-day and next-day delivery, and our Walmart.com assortment has grown to nearly 75 million SKUs.","Acquisitions like Bonobos and ModCloth bring unique, private-branded products to our shopping experience. In addition, partnerships like the agreement with Lord & Taylor will help create specialty experiences that complement our own assortment with more brands customers want.","Jet.com complements Walmart.com nicely. Walmart.com, including Online Grocery, is and has been the key driver of our eCommerce growth and that will continue. The Jet brand over indexed with higher-income, urban, millennial customers when we made the acquisition, and we intend to build on that strength going forward.","The cost to acquire a new customer on a nationwide basis is cheaper with the Walmart brand so we've been investing more in Walmart.com on a national basis and reducing marketing investment in Jet, except in certain urban markets.","Due to this change, Jet will not grow as quickly as it did in early days but it will be well positioned where we've chosen to focus the brand. We'll continue to evaluate ourselves on the total U.S. eCommerce growth number.","Moving to Sam's Club. You'll remember that we made a decision to close 63 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. We've talked about transforming the Sam's business, and part of this transformation means managing the club portfolio to include clubs that are both financially viable and that fit within the strategic framework for the future.","Closing stores and clubs is difficult. It's obviously difficult for our impacted associates, and there is never a good time to do with. John and the Sam's team are working to place as many of them as possible at nearby locations. These closures will help us run a healthier business.","We also took additional steps recently to align resources around the initiatives that are most important to our members. We enhanced the value of the Plus membership with a free shipping proposition. We also made the decision to remove tobacco from certain clubs.","In addition, Sam's Club changed its merchandising structure to encourage more expertise and continuity in buying roles. The strategy continues to come to life, and we're already seeing progress.","Our International team continues to deliver consistently solid results. While Walmex led the way this year, our good performance was broad-based. In fact, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year, and 5 of those markets grew comp sales by more than 5%.","To give a little more detail, Walmex comp store sales increased 6% this year, and we're really proud of how the team is combining our stores with eCommerce to deliver a convenient, seamless shopping experience.","As we mentioned in our October Investment Community Meeting, there's more work to be done on the portfolio. We've set priorities, focused our - on our North American core and key growth markets, including China and India.","During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to wind down the Brazil first-party eCommerce business. We always want our resources aimed at winning in the most strategic places.","So overall, the International segment continues to make steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and eCommerce.","In conclusion, we have a plan that leverages our unique assets and strengths to benefit customers and shareholders. It's resulting in momentum. We're being disciplined about cost and capital, and we're acting faster as a company but are pushing to increase our speed.","Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Brett, you want to pick up there?","Brett Biggs","All right. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter and for the full year. We've made progress on several fronts, and we have good momentum across the business as we enter the new fiscal year.","Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33 and $4.42 for the fiscal year. GAAP EPS of $0.73 for the fourth quarter and $3.28 for the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a number of discrete items totaling $0.60 and $1.14, respectively.","Most of these items position the business for more efficient growth going forward, including closing 63 Sam's Clubs locations to create a more viable fleet and healthier business.","In addition, we discontinued real estate projects in the U.S., following our decision to open fewer stores and clubs, with greater emphasis on comp sales and eCommerce growth.","We also completed our third bond tender of the year to take advantage of more favorable interest rates. A full reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included in today's earnings release.","During the quarter, we had additional EPS headwind related to some smaller unplanned items and expenses we incurred as we pulled forward initiatives in order to take advantage of a higher tax deduction. These were only partially offset by slightly more favorable currency exchange rates.","Before we get to the results, I'd like to highlight some accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue surpassed $500 billion for the first time and increased $15.1 billion or 3.1% in constant currency.","Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 2.1%, the highest growth rate since fiscal 2009, led by traffic growth of 1.4%. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 44%, reaching $11.5 billion. We made good progress on expenses, especially in Walmart U.S. stores and International. Without the discrete items mentioned in arriving at adjusted EPS, we would have leveraged expenses.","Adjusted EPS increased 2%. Operating cash flow was $28.3 billion. The company returned $14.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and strong working capital improvements continued.","Let's move on to the quarter. We delivered a solid quarter to finish out the year as constant-currency revenue grew 3.1% to $135.1 billion. Comp sales were positive in all 3 segments with growth of 2.6% and 2.4% at Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club, respectively.","On a 2 year stack basis, comp sales accelerated for the third consecutive quarter for both of these segments at 4.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Even more encouraging is that these results were driven by strong in-store traffic. International grew net sales 2.8% in constant currency, led by strength at Walmex.","Consolidated gross profit margin declined 61 basis points. Approximately two thirds of the decline was driven by price investments in certain markets and the mix effect from our growing eCommerce business. The remaining one third was driven by Sam's Club inventory markdowns associated with closures and other International items, including the wind down of our Brazil first-party eCommerce business. Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we'll continue to make investments that will pressure the rates some but not to the extent of this quarter.","Similar to our full year results, SG&A and operating income were significantly impacted by charges for discrete items. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have decreased less than 1%.","Let's move on to U.S. eCommerce. As Doug mentioned, the slowdown in growth during the quarter was a bit more than we planned. Looking ahead, we have a number of new initiatives planned for the year. We expect eCommerce growth to increase from the Q4 level as we enter the New Year, with about 40% growth for the year.","Now let's discuss the results for each operating segment during the quarter, beginning with Walmart U.S. The U.S. team continued to produce strong top line growth. Customers are responding well to our everyday low prices and the convenience we're providing through a variety of initiatives. All store formats had positive comps, and we saw strength in key categories with increased customer traffic and units.","During the fourth quarter, comp sales increased 2.6%, led by traffic growth of 1.6%. Comp sales performance on a 2 year stack was the best in 8 years, and eCommerce contributed approximately 60 basis points to the segment.","Gross margin rate declined 50 basis points in the quarter due primarily to price investments, higher transportation expenses and mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.","Also, the team leveraged operating expenses slightly even when considering adjustments for discrete items in both current and prior year periods. Overall, we like the momentum we see in Walmart U.S. Our strategy is working, and customers are responding.","International had another solid quarter. The teams around the world have done a nice job of delivering top line growth through a focus on price as well as strength in fresh and private brands. Growth was broad-based across the markets, and results at Walmex were particularly strong.","Overall, net sales in constant currency increased 2.8% and grew 6.7% on a reported basis. Changes in currency rates benefited net sales by approximately $1.2 billion. It's also important to note the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of about $400 million when compared to last year.","From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income decreased 16.1% in constant currency and 10.9% on a reported basis. As detailed in this morning's release, restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets negatively impacted operating income. Without these items, operating income would have increased year-over-year.","Overall, we're pleased with the consistent performance we've seen from our International business, and we feel good about the year ahead.","Sam's delivered solid top line results. Comp sales without fuel increased 2.4%, led by traffic increase of 4.3%. Tobacco negatively impacted comp sales by 120 basis points. ECommerce growth was solid and contributed 80 basis points to the comp.","Also in the eCommerce space, the team recently announced the free shipping offer from SamsClub.com for Plus members. The team is moving quickly and making decisions that we believe will benefit our members and the business over time.","I'll close today with guidance. As always, we have a number of assumptions on our guidance, including the economic conditions and the tax and regulatory landscape, and our largest markets remain generally consistent.","You'll recall that we issued fiscal year 2019 guidance last October at our meeting for the investment community. Since that time, we made some decisions and assessed other potential opportunities to accelerate investments, particularly - primarily as a result of tax reform.","Let me start with our expectations related to tax reform. Our estimates are based on available information and our current analysis regarding the application of the new law.","We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be 24% to 26% compared with our previous guidance prior to tax reform of 32.5%. Our global blended rate is higher than the new U.S. federal rate due to state taxes and taxes we pay outside of the U.S.","In terms of cash flow, in addition to the income statement benefit from a lower U.S. tax rate, we expect an additional cash tax benefit due primarily to accelerated depreciation.","Including all aspects of tax reform, we currently expect a cash benefit of around $2 billion for the year. Additionally, we are reviewing our cash positions overseas in light of the new law but have not made any decisions regarding potential repatriation.","Our priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. We'll focus first on investing on our business and other growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend, as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we announced a $20 billion share repurchase program back in October.","We've consistently talked about investing in the business for the long term while balancing near-term results. As tax reform is taking shape, we took the opportunity to step back and assess various aspects of the business, including potential investments. We will continue to be aggressive but thoughtful to ensure we win long term.","We recently announced some additional investments related to increased wages, training and benefits for our associates in the U.S. In addition to that, we'll look to accelerate investments in our customers through lower prices, and we'll make investments in technology, supply chain and eCommerce to better position the company for the future. We'll also continue to prioritize winning with customers in our grocery and fresh business, ensuring we make shopping with us simple and at a great value.","At the October meeting, Doug talked about some decisions we had in the Q, but it was too early to comment further at that time. During the quarter we took several actions, including: a wind down of the first-party eCommerce business in Brazil, the closure of 63 Sam's Clubs locations in the U.S. and the decision to remove tobacco from certain locations at Sam's. These decisions impact the guidance we gave in October, particularly in regards to total sales growth, so I'll quantify the impacts and compare back to the October guidance.","Let's first talk about Brazil eCommerce. We expect a headwind to sales of approximately $500 million related to the wind down of the first-party portion of the business. In terms of profit, the benefit of fewer operating losses will be largely offset by onetime costs associated with the wind down.","As for Sam's, we anticipate a negative impact to sales of about $6.3 billion related to the decisions to close clubs and remove tobacco from certain locations. Additionally, recall that we sold our Suburbia business in Mexico in the second quarter of last year, and this will create a headwind in the first quarter of this year.","The combined top line impact of these items will negatively impact consolidated net sales growth by about 140 basis points. And as a result, we now expect net sales growth to range between 1.5% and 2% in constant currency. Adjusting for these changes, this growth compares to the guidance of at or above 3% that we provided in October.","As for comp sales, we expect growth at Walmart U.S. of at least 2%. Sam's Club comps excluding fuel and tobacco should range between 3% and 4% and flat to negative 1% when including the impact of reduced tobacco sales. We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency.","Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October.","On a consolidated basis, we still expect to slightly leverage expenses but not to the extent we originally planned. Excluding the impact of the reduction in Sam's Club sales, leverage would be stronger. Overall, cost management is continuing to improve across the business, and we remain pleased with the progress.","As for operating margin, we expect consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 4.3% to 4.4% in constant currency, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease in operating income versus operating income this past year, adjusted for the discrete items.","Considering all of these items, we expect full year EPS to be in a range of $4.75 and $5, an increase of 7% to 13% compared with adjusted EPS of $4.42 in fiscal 2018. This range represents an increase from the guidance given in October.","Additional guidance is included in the materials we issued this morning, so please reference these documents as you analyze our outlook. Going forward, we're moving to an annual guidance framework with quarterly updates as warranted.","We considered a number of factors when making this decision, including management's long-term view of the business, the transformation of the business, the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders and the uncertainty of the timing of investments during the year.","There could be fluctuations within the quarters, but we believe EPS growth will be relatively consistent across the year. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","So with that, I'll close by saying thank you to our shareholders for your support of Walmart. And now I'd be happy, along with Doug, to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning, guys. And thanks for doing the call. My first question is on the e-com growth in the fourth quarter relative to next year. You mentioned some operational issues. Can you elaborate and then talk about what gives you confidence that the e-com run rate will accelerate heading into next year?","Doug McMillon","Hi, Simeon. This is Doug. Happy to elaborate a bit more. First of all, I would say that, as we try to communicate in our remarks, most of that was expected and planned. As we came around the fourth quarter and looked at what we did last year promotionally, realized we're lapping Jet for sometime now, we've expected a lower growth rate.","The minority of the miss that was more operational in nature that we're referring to is related to the fact that, during the seasonal spikes, seasonal inventory, think electronics, toys, gifts, things like that, came into our fulfillment centers and there was enough cube that it harmed our basic in-stock on more everyday items, and our basic in-stock for eCommerce suffered as a result.","So we're learning how to deal with higher volumes and learning how to deal with a higher peak than what we had previously. But again, that was the minority of the issue. Most of this was planned and in our numbers.","Brett Biggs","And Simeon, just to remind -- this is Brett. As a reminder, in October, we've guided to $11.5 billion of revenue for Walmart U.S. eCommerce, and that's just about where we came in for the year.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then if I can ask my follow-up. Brett, you mentioned you were doing the comparison with pre- and post-October guidance. So I think at that point, EBIT was supposed to be up maybe low single digits, and now it's going to be down a little bit.","Can you just tell us if the entirety of that change is tax reform spending? Or is any part of it reflective of higher cost in the business in some form or another?","Brett Biggs","Yes, Simeon. I still remain -- feel good about the cost management in the business, and we're making progress there. When we've given guidance back in October, we've talked about an operating income range that would be similar to where we had kind of been.","So as we step back and we looked at everything, we've decided to make these investments that we talked about, and that's all included in the guidance that's there today.","And so it's -- that one is a little bit tougher to compare pre and post, but when you look at the investments that we're making, that is the difference. But I feel good about the overall cost management side of the business.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Simeon. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robbie Ohmes","Good morning, guys. ","Doug McMillon","Hey, Robbie.","Robbie Ohmes","So a follow-up on Simeon's just - and then on gross margin. So I just wanted to get clarity on the eCommerce growth outlook. So the first question is just, where -- the confidence in the eCommerce growth going back to roughly 40%, are you seeing that already in the first quarter? And sort of what is the difference to get back to the 40% versus the fourth quarter?","And then could you tie that into the gross margin outlook you gave? Maybe some thoughts on where you might be investing in price. And also, I think the guidance, Brett, was that gross margin rate would be down less in fiscal '19. So if eCommerce is going to reaccelerate to a sort of 40% type growth rate, why wouldn't we see more pressure on gross margin? Thanks.","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Robbie. This is Doug. I'll start with the eCommerce question, and Brett can elaborate on it too if he would like to. We're not expecting the first quarter to go all the way to 40%. We think it'll start to ramp up from the fourth quarter to approximately 40% for the year. We're going to continue expanding our eCommerce business as it relates to food. Online Grocery's ramping up.","As we've said, we're going to almost double the number of locations that do Online Grocery. That will drive eCommerce growth to a certain level. And then on top of that, we've got the activity planned for both Walmart.com and Jet. So we've got an investment plan there.","We have an assortment plan and other innovations, as you saw last year, that will be occurring as we go through the year. So we think by the time we get to the end of the year and look back at the number for the total year, it will be approximately 40%.","Brett Biggs","Yes. Robbie, I'll comment more on gross margin. As we've talked about before, there's a number of things that impact gross margin. Price, shrink, transportation expenses, all of that go into that. And so as we've said before, it's tough to look at gross margin quarter-to-quarter. I think you have to look at it on a longer base. And what I'd said in my comments is that we expect that next year's decrease won't be what we saw in the fourth quarter.","And if you look at where we've guided operating income and the comment we've made about slightly leveraging expenses, you can kind of back into what -- a bit of what we're expecting from a gross margin perspective. So we do take into consideration the mix of the business.","We'll continue to be aggressive but thoughtful on pricing, where we invest, how we invest, both in stores and eCommerce, but we'll be thoughtful about those investments.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Robbie. Rob, next question please?","Operator","The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Just two clarifications and then a bigger picture question. So on the gross margin, the comment that you expect next year's decrease won't be where you were in the fourth quarter, is that including or excluding Sam's? So is that the 61 basis points or around 40?","Brett Biggs","That's all in next year as far as gross margin rate.","Karen Short","Okay. And then I know you kind of said that your comments on earnings growth will be - the cadence growth rate will be similar throughout the year. Is that fair to say, for U.S. comps, you don't really expect a lot of volatility throughout the year?","Brett Biggs","Yes. I don't expect a lot of volatility throughout the year. Overall, for the year, we expect it to be 2% or higher, but I don't expect a lot of volatility during the year, Karen.","Karen Short","Okay. And then I guess I wanted to just turn to the color in terms of acquiring customers on Walmart.com versus Jet.com. Is it -- I guess, is it fair to say then, since you're switching to, I guess, a lower-cost customer to look to acquire, is it fair to say that eCommerce losses have kind of bottomed? Is it still consistent with what you previously said that eCommerce losses have bottomed in '18?","And then I guess, bigger picture, is there any color on Jet? Like do you feel as good as you have always felt in terms of the prospects for Jet and this is just pure math, it just makes more sense to go after the Walmart.com customer?","Doug McMillon","Yes. Karen, this is Doug. Great questions. I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in eCommerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in eCommerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses.","Our visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through.","As it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar.","Now on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition.","I think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com.","So I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority.","Karen Short","Thank you.","Steve Schmitt","Rob, next question please?","Unidentified Analyst","And if I could just ask\u2026","Steve Schmitt","We\u2019re limited to just one question, just to get through as many as we can, please. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. Regarding eCommerce and the road ahead, what are your thoughts on profitability and the smart baskets and pricing and how you're thinking about grocery pickup as well as supply chain in the context of bricks post clicks?","And would love your thoughts on eCommerce M&A and on correlated assets as you've been quite creative about thinking about how to build this business over time? Thank you.","Doug McMillon","Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong.","Now we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance.","So now let's click to eCommerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food eCommerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food eCommerce business, and that's what we're doing.","Learning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year.","Now let's click to the part of the eCommerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into eCommerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an eCommerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on eCommerce is.","So you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand.","So as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment.","It might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Oliver. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up question on gross margin. So can you talk about the 60 basis point decline in the U.S.? Where was that relative to your expectations going into the quarter?","And then what aspects of those buckets moderate as you look to the upcoming year such that the gross margin degradation improves? Thank you.","Brett Biggs","Yes. Chris, this is Brett. As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis points you mentioned was total company, and there is about third of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil eCommerce shutdown and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was -- about third of that was onetime type items.","In the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price.","As you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter.","Doug McMillon","Chris, this is Doug. I'll just add that I think we're getting better at managing our price investment considering all the other investments that we're making. So Brett and I and the management team are watching eCommerce growth rates, eCommerce profitability, store traffic counts and making decisions in a relatively fast cycle on how much price to invest and where to invest it, and we're monitoring what happens when we do that.","So we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after.","And one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable.","And the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long-term.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Chris. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. Several years ago, Walmart was ahead of the curve, investing in stores, e-com, in price, and you really saw a gain in terms of market share and your outperformance relative to a lot of other retailers. Now it seems like some of those share gains may be slowing a bit.","So do you think you're seeing diminishing returns on your investments and you'll have to make even greater investments in order to outperform at the rate that you have been versus others?","Doug McMillon","No. Michael, this is Doug. That's not my perception, and the data doesn't support that. When you look at our share numbers, we feel really good about them, and not only the dollar share numbers but also units. I'm specifically thinking of the U.S. business in my comment. But the tonnage moving through our stores is increasing, and I don't feel a trend shift there.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Michael. Rob, next question please?","Operator","Next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And before I ask it, I concur, our data does show you guys continue to gain a lot of market share, particularly in food. But that's kind of where I want to go with my question. If we fast-forward, guys, 5 years from now and we see a substantial, I think about 60% -- 67% of your sales are either pharmacy or food, and a good portion of that becomes click-and-collect or even maybe delivered to the home, how should we think about Walmart's profitability? And have you guys done a lot of thinking on that? Thanks.","Doug McMillon","Yes. Why don't we both -- I mean, you can go first, Brett.","Brett Biggs","Yes. I think as, Mike -- I mean, Scott, as Doug was saying, we do spend a lot of time as a management team thinking ahead, obviously, next quarter, next year, 3 years out, 5 years out and how we manage all the pieces of our portfolio, and that includes International portfolio, Sam's Club, eCommerce, Walmart, and thinking about how we will manage as this business changes.","We know it changes. The customer is changing, and we're going to stay out in front of the customer. And the great thing about our business is we have so many different ways to do that, and we -- and the diversity of our portfolio gives us more options in which to do that.","And I think we sit back and we say we know where we want to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and there's a lot of different ways to get to that versus just one direct path. And so there's different things that we can do to manage that over time.","Doug McMillon","I think the only thing I would add is that we're learning kind of the activity-based cost aspects of different paths. And I think, over time, if we could, and I think smart cart causes us to believe we might be able to, we'd like to bring the customers into this conversation and help them understand through our pricing and our communication that if you want to buy a single can of corn for under $1, there's not going to be a better, more efficient path to you than a supercenter visit.","As the shape of a basket changes, food and non-food, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of eCommerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches.","So part of what we're trying to build with eCommerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Scott. Rob, Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. I think I have a different way of asking the eCommerce and profitability question. Understanding that this is a year in which you're probably making some investments that you may not have made because of tax reform, is there anything that you learned since you spoke with us back in October that suggests it would be more expensive due to market conditions to get to 40% annual eCommerce growth than you had previously thought?","Doug McMillon","No, I don't think so. Matt, my head, when you asked the question, started dividing it into food and non-food. There's nothing new on food. I think if you go back and listen to or watch our October analyst presentation where we walked through the strategy for food, all of that, even more convicted, still holds.","On the non-food side, we're building a business. It's \u2013 non-food eCommerce is -- has not been our historic competency over the last few decades and the history of the company, and so we're learning something new.","We're trying to build an assortment that enables a margin ultimately, and that's got components to it like attracting brands, being able to execute from a fulfillment point of view during a busy season.","We've got some exciting things coming out with site redesign and other things this spring, I think, that will help us make more progress in that area. So I don't think it's that we've learned something new. I think it's a question of pace. And are the operational improvements and merchandising improvements happening? And are you investing marketing to kind of coincide with those improvements.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Matt. Rob, next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just to drill down a little bit more on some of the questions that have been asked. I think apparel has been highlighted by several media outlets over the weekend.","Can you walk us through what the overall apparel strategy is in store and online and how you're balancing national brands with private label?","Doug McMillon","Sure. I'm excited about -- later this week, I'm headed down to Houston because we've got all of our store managers there and these new apparel brands that have been mentioned in the media are on the sales floor, and I hear they look great. We're focused on improving quality; still managing good, better and best; protecting opening price points, which we do such a great job of; reducing our SKU counts in apparel to improve our presentation.","And we have some new fixturing in some stores that we're expanding on this year so that everything fits together, the quality of the product, the value of the product, the brand presentation of it, the ability to present it well because you have fewer SKUs and then a presentation in terms of fixturing that enables that to look fresh and new.","We've got a big apparel business. It has been growing, but we have even more opportunity to grow it in store. And then online, there are numerous opportunities for us to build private brands, leverage the DNVBs of the world like Bonobos and ModCloth and maybe more in the future and attract other brands to both Walmart and Jet that will help us drive our apparel business and manage the mix. So apparel is a pretty big focus at the moment.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Kate. Next question please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jeffries.","Dan Binder","Hi, thanks. You've talked about accelerating certain investments, so I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more specific on what those are and whether or not there'll be any lumpiness by quarter that we should consider. I know you're giving annual guidance, but just want to make sure we consider the quarters as well.","Brett Biggs","Yes. Dan, this is Brett. The investments that we're going to make are going to continue to change how we work as a company, help us continue to stay ahead of the customer, and those are going to be in the areas of technology. They're going to be in the areas of supply chain, pricing.","And you can imagine, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into a lot of things that we plan to do, and we'll be talking about those as we go throughout the year. We mentioned we think EPS growth will be pretty consistent throughout the year quarter by quarter.","There could be a quarter or two where we make an investment that's different than the other quarters. And if that's the case, we would talk about that when we release earnings. But right now, I don't anticipate major changes quarter-to-quarter.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Dan. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and also thank you for doing this call. Just wanted to circle back on margins. The guidance for 4.3% to 4.4% for the year, obviously, a lot of moving parts and some acceleration in investments. So just want to confirm that your thought process is that there is an ability to find further leverage over time and expand from those levels as we look forward.","And also, more specifically, for the current quarter, if you can just touch a little bit more detail regarding the transportation cost impact that you saw and what your expectations are on that particular line item going forward.","Brett Biggs","Sure. Paul, appreciate it. I'll start with the operating income question. We're only giving guidance for this year coming forward. We did leverage expenses. Excluding discrete items for the year, leverage got better as we went throughout the year. So I am optimistic about the expense leverage that we're seeing in the business, particularly in International and Walmart U.S. stores, and I expect that we'll continue to see that progress.","So that gives us -- we've always talked about that being better with expenses gives us more flexibility and more ways in which to hit the P&L that we would like to and do what we want to do for our customers. So that's the only guidance we're going to give, is we'll be this, this year on operating income.","On transportation costs, those vary from quarter-to-quarter. As you know, gas prices -- fuel prices have gone up a little bit. In this last quarter, I think we're maybe $0.30 versus last year roughly. So that has a bearing on what we do year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter, but that was the main mention of that in the fourth quarter.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Paul. The next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens.","Ben Bienvenu","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about the working capital opportunities that you see for FY '19? Obviously, you've done a great job in inventory in the U.S. Can working capital continue to be a source of cash for Walmart? Or have you harvested all the opportunity that you can?","Brett Biggs","Thanks, Ben. Yes, there's always more opportunity. If Greg Foran were sitting here, he would talk about, as he goes into store by store, he still sees opportunity for us to be better, to be more efficient. Some of the technology that we've talked about and investments will continue to lead to easier ways for our associates to move goods, stock goods.","So all of that helps, and all of that matters. I don't think there's ever an end to what we can do on working capital. The last 2 years have been -- to be fair, have been pretty impressive, the last couple of years, particularly on payables and the inventory side.","So I think there's more room to go. I won't quantify what I think that could be, but I do believe working capital can continue to be a source of cash for Walmart going forward.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Ben. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","Hey, guys. You've shown signs of being willing to rationalize the asset base here more recently, but, obviously, continue to invest in eCommerce. So how do you see the ROIC profile evolving over the next few years? Just curious how important stabilizing that metric is to you as you guys think about your broader priorities? Thanks.","Brett Biggs","Yes, great question. And Peter, as you know, we've talked a lot about ROI. It's important to us. Returns are important, along with a number of other metrics that we've mentioned this morning.","If you pull out the discrete items, ROI would have been in a much better place in this last year, and we've seen improvements in our asset base and rationalizing that operating income being where it is. Returns short term, long term are really important for the company.","We are going to make sure that we win long term. And as we've said before, there may be times year-to-year where that has an impact on ROI that is different than we would want on a long-term basis.","But we will make those decisions when we need to do that. But returns are very important for us, and we talk about it a lot as a management team, as you would imagine.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Peter. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys. Good morning. Two quick questions. The first one is, did you give a number on inflation and sort of the trends that you're seeing on -- especially on the food inflation?","And then the other one is, on fulfillment centers, you're converting, I think it's, 10 of the Sam's Clubs into fulfillment centers. Can you just give us an idea of where you think you are with your ability on the fulfillment center proposition in the business?","Brett Biggs","Yes. Bob, on inflation, we didn't see a meaningful impact in the quarter. And going forward, probably a modest impact -- slight impact next year, but nothing meaningful really next year.","Doug McMillon","And on the fulfillment side, I would say we're in pretty good shape in terms of square footage and where it's placed. We had these 6 fulfillment centers with Walmart, the 3 we picked up from Jet. And Marc and the team are learning how to mirror inventory in certain places to improve customer service levels and to lower cost. So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here.","If we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape. Over the years, looking ahead, as we grow the business, we may open a fulfillment center here and there, but that's where we stand today.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Bob. Rob, next question please.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I wanted to tie it back a little into the reinvestment of the tax benefits. I think you guys have invested about $750 million in labor that was announced about a month ago. When you think about the magnitude that would go back into price, should we think about it being similar to what was in SG&A?","Or how would we even frame that? And you can answer to this year or even over the next couple of years. Thanks.","Brett Biggs","Yes, Greg. As I said earlier, we're not going to get into a lot of detail about how we're going to invest. The wage amount you mentioned, about $400 million of that was the onetime bonus. The other part would be going forward into next year with the increase in the start rate.","And I'll say what I said before, which is we're going to be thoughtful about these investments. And we have a lot of levers that we can use to satisfy that customer, and we're going to be thoughtful about which levers we pull.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Greg. Rob, next question please.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Yeah, hi. Good morning. I would just like to talk about - or ask about investment in grocery at this point, just in terms of price investment, how you're thinking about the returns that you're getting on that investment, how you balance that against investing in the digital experience for the customer. I would think that, at this point, you're getting to an area, given your price perception and competitive marketplace, that maybe digital is the better return.","And then you did mention grocery delivery. Could you just give us an update on where you stand there at this point?","Doug McMillon","Sure. As you think about price investments in store, think about grocery, consumables and the fact that, across the store, there are some items, windshield washer fluid in the automotive department, tennis balls in sporting goods, that are high-turn, price-sensitive items to a degree. And when we think about the price investments in the store, we're not singularly focused on dry grocery. We're thinking about this in a broad way.","The supercenter assortment is a big advantage, and we want to deliver low prices across the store, which also helps us drive traffic to the store and manage margins across the entire store. So evaluate the price investment through that lens rather than just grocery. And the returns we're seeing there are attractive. You can see it in the store traffic.","And we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the eCommerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in eCommerce.","There may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on eCommerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path. We kind of watch that very continuously basically.","As it relates to grocery delivery, we've had this small pilot going on with our own associates, and we'll continue to play around with that and learn what works there. But the expansion will happen through a variety of platforms. We'll use, depending on the spot in the country, different providers to get the product to the customer, and we'll be keeping an eye on NPS scores in particular.","Our Online Grocery business has a really high Net Promoter Score, and we want to, as we start to grow delivery capabilities, ensure that the customer experience is as good through delivery as it is for pickup. So we've got some things to learn there, and it'll happen at a pace based on the customer experience.","Steve Schmitt","Thanks, Ed. Rob, we have time for one question.","Operator","That final question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Doug, from a capital allocation standpoint, could you discuss a little bit about closing the 63 Sam's stores earlier? And then should we expect to see continued closings both in the U.S. and International? And then for Brett, on the digital side, could you shed some light on the growth between 1P and 3P for the e-com business? Thanks.","Doug McMillon","Sure. I'll take capital allocation first. If you go back a couple of years, you'll remember that we closed quite a few stores around the world, including the 100-some-odd Express stores in Walmart U.S., the smaller stores that we have been testing as a pilot -- as a format. We discontinued those and closed those.","At that moment in time, we had been through all of the 11,600-plus units around the world, sitting through real estate, meeting, Brett, country by country and making choices about the portfolio. So we did a lot of that cleanup then. We didn't do Sam's Club at the time.","We were still working through a number of things, pacing things out, trying to put them in the right sequence. So the way I was thinking of it is let's make sure that the U.S. store business is strong. What do we need to make that work? That's where we made wage investments, price investments and cleaned up the portfolio. We've been focused on -- focusing on building an eCommerce business. That's still underway obviously. And then now we've turned our attention to Sam's Club.","We've got a strategy we believe in, a leadership team we're excited about, and we're investing in that business to drive comps up there. So it's just been a sequencing, and the bottom line is we've been through the portfolio. I can't tell you there will never be more closings. A store here and there, I think, makes sense, but we've been through the majority of that big work for now anyway.","Brett Biggs","Chuck, on your question of 1P and 3P, obviously, first part, they're part - they're both important to us. We want to satisfy that customer need. Sometimes, it's better done through first party; sometimes, it's better done through third party. As you know, we have about 75 million SKUs now on our Marketplace site.","And it's another one of those levers that we've talked about -- I was talking about earlier that we have in order to determine how we best fulfill that customer need in a way that makes sense for both top line and bottom line.","Steve Schmitt","Well, thanks, guys. We certainly appreciate you joining our call today. And have a great day.","Brett Biggs","Thank you all.","Doug McMillon","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."],"21865":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call August 18, 2016  7:00 AM ET","Executives","Steve Schmitt - VP of IR","Doug McMillon - President & CEO","Brett Biggs - EVP & CFO","Analysts","Operator","Steve Schmitt","Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Wal-Mart's Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 results. This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 18, 2016. On today's call you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO, and Brett Biggs, CFO.","This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.","As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the investors portion of our corporate website; stock.walmart.com.","For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q2 reporting period ran from Saturday, April 30th, through Friday, July 29th, of this year. And, as previously announced, our annual meeting for the investment community will be in Bentonville, Arkansas on October 5th and 6th. We plan on having facility tours on the 5th with our meeting taking place on the 6th. We look forward to seeing you here.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Wal-Mart CEO, Doug McMillon.","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our second quarter results. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.07. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $123.6 billion, an increase of 2.8% over last year.","We exceeded our Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance this quarter, with Walmart U.S. delivering comp sales of 1.6%, driven by a traffic increase of 1.2%. This was our 8th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our 7th consecutive quarter of positive traffic.","I\u2019m encouraged by what I'm seeing when I visit stores and pleased with how Greg Foran, our leadership team and our associates are executing our plan to win. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve, and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down 6.5% and in-stock levels are up.","We\u2019re also showing progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, GMV and e-commerce sales increased 13% and 11.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets.","This was primarily due to growth in our marketplace offering in the U.S., the continued roll out of online grocery and growth of pick-up in stores and clubs. We continue to see proof that our customers enjoy a seamless shopping experience.","The distinctions that we talk about today between stores, apps, pick-up, delivery and sites are continuing to blur into the background for customers. For them, it\u2019s just Walmart.","We've built a solid foundation in e-commerce under the leadership of Neil Ashe. During Neil\u2019s tenure, we more than doubled our e-commerce GMV, became the second most trafficked e-commerce site in the U.S., re-platformed Walmart.com, opened a national fulfillment center network and most importantly, became known as a great place to work for talented technologists and e-commerce professionals in Silicon Valley. Neil also led our discussions with JD.","Neil will be with Wal-Mart through the end of our fiscal year working on our e-commerce strategies in several international markets. I\u2019d like to thank him for his significant contributions to our company.","Building on this solid foundation, we made some strategic decisions to position ourselves for the future in the priority markets of the U.S. and China, including the announcement last week to acquire Jet.com.","Operating Walmart.com and Jet.com will allow us to reach even more customers and drive a higher level of growth more quickly. One of the things we like about the technology they've developed is that it rewards customers in real time with savings on a basket of goods and puts them more in charge of the price they pay. This empowers customers in a way that is true to the spirit of Walmart.","When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours. Wal-Mart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. It\u2019s important to remember that customers won\u2019t see changes immediately as we await government approval, and the necessary tech platform changes, which will take time.","Once the acquisition is complete, we look forward to welcoming Marc Lore, current President and CEO of Jet.com. He will join Wal-Mart as our new President and CEO of e-commerce, reporting to me. He will be responsible for both the Walmart and Jet brands in the U.S. Marc is a passionate merchant and innovative thinker who will definitely add value to our business. I look forward to working with him.","In China, our recently announced transaction with, and investment in, JD.com improves our position there. JD's significant presence online, where Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will feature prominently, affords us the opportunity to extend the reach of our brands to millions of new customers.","I made a couple of visits to JD's delivery and pickup points in Shanghai when I was last in China and am excited about the potential it creates for our customers there. Richard Liu, CEO of JD.com, is a talented e-commerce merchant and we look forward to our collaborations going forward.","Additionally, we made advancements in the U.S. on our key priorities to build digital relationships with customers, scale the assortment and expand online grocery. As of June, we have rolled out Wal-Mart Pay nationwide to all stores.","Customers tell us they love the convenience of this unique service, and we've found that a majority of transactions come from repeat users. If you haven't tried Wal-Mart Pay, please do and share your feedback.","Customers also continue to enjoy our online grocery pickup service and give it high marks. We added grocery pickup to 30 more markets this quarter bringing our total to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. It's gratifying to see how much this service helps our customers save time.","Next, we are growing our marketplace offering at a strong pace. Since the beginning of the year, we've added about 7 million new items to the assortment and today offer approximately 15 million SKUs.","Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way, and I'm pleased with the fact that the momentum in the business is broad based across all formats and countries.","In China, in addition to expanding our reach through the strategic alliance with JD.com, we continue to grow our base of stores and clubs. In fact, we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel. China remains a strategic focus for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally.","In the U.K., the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics.","We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turn-around will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency.","At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales for the period were slightly above our expectations. Membership performance was the highlight, and there is quite a bit of innovation underway at Sam's related to the member experience.","Earlier this year we launched a test of Scan and Go, a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service, and we expect to roll this out nationwide later this year.","We also saw strong growth in the quarter from both Club Pickup and direct to home e-commerce. The new platform we are using to prospect for new members and better manage their accounts will help us deliver on our priority of growing membership. These innovations are making it easy for members to shop and save time.","Finally, I've enjoyed my time this week with more than 5,000 store leaders and merchants with the U.S. team at our annual Holiday Meeting in Denver. We've got a great plan for the busiest time of year, and the mood at the meeting was deservedly upbeat.","I'd like to thank our store managers and all of our associates for the job they're doing. In summary, I'm pleased with the momentum in the business. We have a plan, and we are executing against it and customers are responding favorably.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We're half way through the year and we continue to be pleased with the momentum we're seeing across many parts of the business. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focusing on the customer and improving core retail fundamentals around the world.","In addition to delivering solid second quarter results, which I'll talk about in a minute, we continue to make decisions that focus the business for long term success. Just in the past few weeks we've furthered our strategy in e-commerce through the alliance with JD.com and the planned acquisition of Jet.com.","In addition, we've agreed to divest our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico, allowing for additional focus on our core business in that market. Each of these decisions aligns with our strategy and demonstrates our commitment to thoughtfully allocating capital against our long term strategy.","Now, let's get to the results. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1.07, which was at the high end of our guidance range, while reported EPS was $1.21. Adjusted EPS excludes a non-cash gain of $0.14, net of tax, from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. We anticipate the gain for the full year will be $0.16 per share, which is within the original guidance range when we announced the transaction.","From a revenue perspective, we had another solid quarter. Excluding the $2.7 billion currency impact, total revenue increased 2.8% to $123.6 billion, while on a reported basis, total revenue was $120.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added net sales of $2.8 billion in the quarter and $7.2 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year.","Walmart U.S. delivered a very solid comp sales increase of 1.6% driven by a 1.2% increase in traffic. It\u2019s now been two full years that Walmart U.S. has delivered positive comp sales \u2013 in fact, on a two-year stack basis, comp sales increased 3.1%.","As Doug mentioned earlier, we made progress in e-commerce with GMV and sales, growing 13% and 11.8%, respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than the international results, and globally we continue to make headway on expanding our assortment and enhancing the shopping experience for our customers.","Whether it\u2019s through Online Grocery, Walmart Pay, or broadening our reach in China through the alliance with JD.com, we're making it easier for customers to access products when and how they want. Now, with the agreement to acquire Jet.com, we're building on our e-commerce foundation and creating an opportunity to accelerate e-commerce even further.","Consolidated gross profit margin increased 53 basis points, driven by improvements in all three operating segments. From an expense standpoint, as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to our previously announced investments in people and technology for this fiscal year. That being said, our teams across the globe remain focused on managing expenses.","In addition to solid operating results, disciplined working capital management and the timing of payments allowed us to generate $10.3 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, which compares to $5.1 billion in the first half of last year.","Continuing to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases is a priority for us and we're fortunate to have such a strong business model that generates substantial distributable cash even after we've invested thoughtfully into the business.","During the quarter, we paid approximately $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchased 30.3 million shares for approximately $2.1 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, we have utilized approximately $7.3 billion of our current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.","With that, let's discuss the results for each of our operating segments, starting with Walmart U.S. We continue to see steady improvement in the Walmart U.S. business as customers respond favorably to the changes we're making in our stores and e-commerce offer. Net sales were up 3.1%, or $2.3 billion, and comp sales rose 1.6% with a 1.2% increase in customer traffic.","We believe a contributing factor to the results is our consistent improvement in customer experience. Customer surveys indicate that we\u2019re making good progress in providing a better shopping experience with cleaner stores, faster checkout and friendlier service.","We've also broadened our e-commerce assortment, strengthened our mobile capabilities and expanded Online Grocery to more than 60 markets and nearly 400 locations. While there is still a lot of work to do in executing our multi-year plan, we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.","E-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment comp, and all of our formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately a 6.5% comp sales growth in the period.","Although difficult to quantify, we know overall sales included some tailwinds from external factors such as continued low gas prices and unseasonably warm weather across much of the country.","However, we also experienced sales headwinds from continued market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by around 100 basis points and our second quarter total segment comp by a similar amount as what we faced in the first quarter.","The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter with positive comp sales and traffic, despite the ongoing deflationary impacts in food. In addition, both general merchandise and health and wellness delivered solid sales growth with strength in home, toys, sporting goods and OTC.","The back-to-school shopping season is in full swing, and we aim to be the destination of choice with low prices on a great assortment of products for parents and students preparing for the new school year.","In the second quarter, we continued to implement a multi-year strategy of incremental price investment in the U.S. business. It's still early days for this initiative, but we are pleased with the initial results. We're committed to providing Everyday Low Prices, using data and analytics to better serve our customers both through stores and e-commerce.","Gross margin increased 33 basis points in the quarter. Improved margin rates in food and consumables were a contributing factor. In addition, we had improvement in our cost of goods due to savings in procuring merchandise, lower transportation expense as a result of lower fuel costs and some improvements in shrink. These benefits are somewhat offset by the implementation of the multi-year strategy of incremental price investments.","Operating expenses increased 8.3% over last year due primarily to the previously announced associate wage rate increases and investments in technology. We remain focused on managing expenses with an EDLC mindset while elevating the shopping environment for customers.","Overall, the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins, resulting in an operating income decline of 6.2%. We're also encouraged by the progress on inventory management with inventory declining about 2.9% in the second quarter versus last year, including a 6.5% decline in comp stores.","By cleaning up our store back rooms, leveraging technology and changing certain processes, we're improving product availability and enabling associates to be on the sales floor serving customers in a more effective way.","Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase in the range of 1% to 1.5%. As a reminder, comp sales for last year's comparable period were 1.5%.","Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International delivered another solid performance in the second quarter. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.","The rate of sales growth in several markets slowed versus our first quarter results, impacted by Leap Day in the first quarter and the Easter holiday shift between first and second quarters in most markets due to the one month reporting lag. Walmex continues to produce strong sales results across all formats, while the U.K. environment remains challenging.","The International team remains focused and continues to execute on key strategic priorities; to actively manage the existing portfolio, deliver balanced growth, be the lowest cost operator, and build strong foundations in talent, trust, and technology.","We continue to be aggressive in managing the portfolio, announcing last week the agreement to sell our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico. In addition, our recently announced strategic alliance with JD.com in China aligns with our growth strategy in this key market by better integrating our digital and physical retail operations.","We also continue to execute aggressive cost reduction programs in the U.K. and Canada, and are expanding cost analytics programs into other markets like Mexico and China.","We also announced market CEO moves this quarter in China, the U.K. and Canada. We are confident these moves position us well for driving improved performance in each of these markets and demonstrate the depth of our talent globally.","With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.2% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 6.6% due to a $2.7 billion currency headwind.","From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 47.5% on a constant currency basis and 35.2% on a reported basis. This increase includes the gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. Excluding the impact from this gain, operating income increased 3.1% on a constant currency basis, which slightly outpaced sales growth. On a reported basis, excluding the gain, operating income decreased 6.7%. ","The accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. However, I would like to provide some highlights on each one. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. ","Walmex continues to lead the way, delivering strong results. Keep in mind, Walmex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions and countries.","Comp sales for Walmex increased 7.3% in the quarter, significantly outpacing the rest of the self-service market. Excluding the gain from the sale of our bank operations in Mexico last year, operating income would have increased faster than sales.","In Canada, despite increased promotional activity by competitors throughout the quarter, comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for nine consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in food and consumables and Health & Wellness.","Our cost analytics program made good progress, helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. Excluding the gain from the sale of certain properties in Canada last year, operating income increased faster than sales. Additionally, we continue to decrease inventory levels and improve efficiency from a store and labor perspective.","In the U.K., fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5%. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics, simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced five-year \u00a31.5 billion price investment.","In China, despite negative comp sales of 0.5% this quarter, our business continues to grow as we expand our footprint throughout the country, and we continue to gain market share in the hypermarket channel.\"We Operate for Less\" initiatives have delivered results, and we were able to leverage expenses. Our recently announced alliance with JD.com enables us to better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail.","JD.com, the leading online direct sales company and the country's largest Internet business by revenue has a complementary offering, allowing us to deliver compelling new experiences that can reach significantly more customers. We are optimistic about our future in China.","In Brazil, despite the ongoing economic recession, we delivered comp sales growth of 4.7%. Our wholesale format continues to perform well and delivered strong growth again this quarter. In addition, we completed our store systems integration, which allows all banners to operate under a single financial system. This will provide better visibility to business outcomes, improved alignment of marketing efforts and further enhance our compliance programs. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with another solid performance from our international business in the quarter. ","Now, let's turn to Sam's Club. Net sales, without fuel, grew by 0.4%. Membership income increased 2.9%, as Plus member counts increased and Plus member penetration is near all-time highs.","Comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.6%, which was slightly above our guidance. Market deflation, especially in food, continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 100 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. We're pleased with how e-commerce performed as both direct to home and Club Pickup had strong growth.","Sam's also continues to make progress on being a leader in the digital space.

This new checkout and payment solution lets members complete the shopping experience using their own mobile device. ","Turning to the third quarter, for the 13-week period ending October 28, 2016, we expect comp sales without fuel to be slightly positive. As a reminder, comp sales for last year\u2019s comparable period increased 0.4%. ","With that let\u2019s wrap things up. There\u2019s always more work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with the first half performance. These results combined with our outlook for the balance of the year give us confidence in raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.15 to $4.35, which includes a range of $0.90 to $1.00 in the third quarter. This compares to previous guidance of $4.00 to $4.30 for the full year.","As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14, net of tax, non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com. In addition, this guidance includes an estimated dilutive EPS impact of approximately $0.05, primarily in the fourth quarter, as a result of expected operating losses, and one-time transaction expenses related to the planned acquisition of Jet.com, assuming the transaction is closed near the beginning of the fourth quarter of FY17.","Keep in mind that this updated guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels and that our full year effective tax rate is expected to be at the low end of our previously stated range of 31.5% to 33.5%.","In closing, we continue to be pleased with momentum we are seeing across many parts of the business. We\u2019re executing against our strategic priorities and continue to focus on the customer. It\u2019s an exciting time at Walmart and we are proud of the progress we\u2019re making.","Thank you for joining our call today.

The smaller neighborhood markets range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 ft.\u00b2.","As a reminder, for fiscal 2016, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13- and 52-week periods respectively. Our Q3 reporting period ran from Saturday, August 1, through Friday, October 30, 2015.","Now let's get on to today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about our results in the context of our overall strategy.

Next we'll begin our operating segments with Greg Foran, President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. Last, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart's CFO, will wrap up with details on guidance for fourth quarter and the full year.","Now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our third-quarter earnings, as well as the strategy we shared at our annual meeting to the investment community last month.","Overall we had a good quarter. We delivered earnings per share well within our guidance range, recorded our fifth straight quarter of positive comps at Wal-Mart U.S. and had solid international sales and profit growth on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we still have plenty of work to do and there are areas of our business that must perform better. Our earnings per share were $1.03 and we posted total revenue of $117.4 billion. I want to highlight that on a constant currency basis, our total revenue would have been $122.4 billion. That's growth of $3.4 billion or 2.8% on a constant currency basis, which is solid growth.","Even if the percentage doesn't sound high because we have such a large denominator, not many companies grow by this amount in a quarter. I call this out because I don't want the currency impacts to obscure the strength of our business. We are a growth company and we're growing.","As we expected, operating income continued to be pressured by our decision to invest in our frontline associates. To improve the store experience for our customers and create a bridge to our future where digital capabilities will play an increasing role in our stores, we're making a $1.2 billion planned investment in our people this year that we understood what impact near-term operating income. This is by far the biggest driver of the decline in consolidated operating income.","Before going into the details, I want to take a step back to talk about our strategy. At our investor meeting last month, we shared more detail than usual about the next three years of our growth plan. We've never been a company that manages only for the short term and that's certainly true during this period of change. Although investments in our people and technology impact near-term earnings, they will help us deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time. We're confident these are the right steps because we know where and how we're going to win. We will be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. No matter how you choose to shop with us, through your mobile device, online, in a store, or a combination, it will be fast and easy. Online retailers are testing physical store experiences because they recognize the same [audio gap] network of stores supported by a supply chain and systems like ours with an emerging set of digital capabilities to win with customers.","As we create this seamless experience we're positioning for growth in five key areas. First, we will continue to win on value. We've won on value in the past and that won't change. Second, convenience is increasingly important as customers want to save both money and time. Third, we will always work to be great merchants whether in stores or online. Fourth, we're focused on the key geographies for customer growth which are North America and China.","Finally, we want to appeal to a blend of income levels the way we're approaching e-commerce, neighborhood markets, Sam's Club, grocery pickup and other areas we'll appeal to value conscious customers of all demographics. We already serve customers from all income levels around the world but we have an opportunity to get even stronger. By taking these steps we will grow the company faster. We will add between $45 and $60 billion of revenue to the company in the next three years. That's a lot of growth. It just happens to be on a big base.","Returning to this quarter's results, one of the most important takeaways is that U.S. stores continue to improve with total net sales up nearly 4%. In addition to positive comp sales, Wal-Mart U.S. had its fourth straight quarter of positive traffic. We're now lapping positive comp sales and building on our progress. Our customers are telling us that our efforts around clean, fast and friendly are resonating. Neighborhood markets continued to show strong sales led by newer stores and have posted positive comps for 19 consecutive quarters. A key part of creating a seamless shopping experience is to have great stores and we feel good about where we're headed.","We also made strides in the U.S. on adding critical capabilities to our supply chain. In the third quarter, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center in Atlanta with more than 1 million ft\u00b2 of space. This is our fifth next-generation fulfillment center. As we build out our e-commerce capabilities we are deepening our digital relationships with our customers. We've accelerated our expansion of online grocery pickup and we've seen that customers who start using online grocery spent nearly 50% more than similar customers who shop only in stores. This is the customer we're going after. The shopper in our sweet spot who accesses Wal-Mart in multiple ways. We also began the chain-wide use of a mobile service that can tell us when a customer is coming to pick up an online general merchandise order before they even walk into the store. We launched a new digital wish list that you can build at home or simply by scanning items in a store. We expect more than 210 million visits to our app in November and December up from 18 million in 2012.","Last month, we told you about our longer-term plans to grow e-commerce sales and GMB. That plan anticipates ebbs and flows along the way but we are confident in our targets. We continue to expect to grow mid to high teens for this fiscal year. During the third quarter, global e-commerce sales and GMB growth both came in at around 10%, this was due primarily to continued economic challenges in our major international markets including Brazil China and the U.K. In the U.S. where we've seen good growth for the year, we continue to make progress on key initiatives. But we know we have more work to do. I was pleased that SamsClub.com continued to deliver strong growth.","In Wal-Mart International we're pleased with the solid 3.2 sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Operating income grew faster than sales at 8.5% excluding currency. Our North American markets delivered strong performance and Mexico in particular is starting to fire on all cylinders. I'm pleased with our momentum in these markets we continue to face specific challenges in the U.K. and Brazil.","China remains a huge long term opportunity. We started in China in 1996. We've grown the business, reached profitability years ago and grown our level of profitability. We obviously learned a lot about Chinese customers and the market and that's an asset. A few weeks ago I was back in Beijing and Shanghai walking stores, clubs and visiting our e-commerce offices. We now have a total of 12 Sam's Clubs open and they're performing very well. Our stores have clearly improved operationally in recent years in particular and now they're supported by a supply chain that positions us to win. We see that e-commerce, online grocery and convenience are critical in the dense urban areas that make up so much of the Chinese opportunity. That's why our Yihaodian acquisition is of such strategic significance.","We also recommitted to our work on food safety, environmental sustainability and empowering women during my visit, announcing another investment in the China Women's Development Foundation. With the improvements we've made to our stores and clubs and the full acquisition of Yihaodian we have a unique opportunity and a plan to put it all together to win in China.","While positive, our U.S. Sam's Club comp sales without fuel were at the low end of our guidance. We were pleased with the growth of membership income but we can do better with our overall results. Sam's Club did take important steps this quarter to deepen digital relationships with our members through club pickup, expanded mobile check-in capabilities and extended drive-through or curbside options. Roz will share more about our strategy going forward in a moment.","In addition to releasing earnings, today is a big day at our home office. We're holding a sustainability milestone meeting to celebrate 10 years of progress on sustainability since our then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a landmark speech titled 21st-Century Leadership. In those remarks, Lee laid out three big bills for Wal-Mart: to be powered by 100% renewable energy; to create zero waste; and to sell products that sustain people and the environment. It was a defining moment for our company. By looking through the lens of sustainability, Lee realized we could think about problems in creative ways, make our business more efficient and bring renewed passion to our work. It was and is inspiring to be part of this journey.","Today we'll mark how far we've come and what we've achieved. For example, the savings we've generated from reducing waste, running our truck fleet more efficiently and pursuing energy efficiency has been good for society and good for our shareholders. We're getting excited to take the next steps in this journey early next year. In true Wal-Mart fashion we're looking at ways to make a difference in the world, serve our stakeholders and drive our bottom line.","Let me reiterate that we are excited about the unique opportunity we have to create a seamless shopping experience for our customers and ensure sustainable growth for the business. We're making critical investments to better serve our customers, associates and shareholders, and we are on the right path.","As I close I want to pause to thank Charles Holley for his years of outstanding service to Wal-Mart. As you know, he's made the decision to retire. He's been a huge asset to the company and a great partner to me and the leadership team. This is his last earnings call and he will be missed. Thank you, Charles.","Now I'll turn it over to Claire. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot","Thanks, Doug. Today I'll provide commentary on the company's consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript. Prior to discussing our results, let me talk about an item that, although immaterial, impacts comparability against last year.","As we disclosed in the second quarter, we conducted a global review of the accounting treatment for leases, which included a focus on leases where our payment of certain structural component costs during a lessor's construction of the leased store causes us to be deemed the owner of the property for accounting purposes. In the third quarter, we finalized this review and recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment.","On a consolidated basis, the immaterial adjustment increased total assets by approximately $1.7 billion, which was primarily an increase in property under capital lease and financing obligations; increased total liabilities by approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily an increase in current and long-term capital lease and financing obligations; and it positively impacted earnings per share by approximately $0.04.","Let's now move to our results for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Wal-Mart EPS were $1.03, which includes the items mentioned above. Additionally, there were significant items that negatively impacted EPS including investments and wages and training, in the U.S. of approximately $0.10 and currency exchange rate movements totaling $0.04. Last year's EPS was $1.15. Total revenue reached $117.4 billion. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $5 billion. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $122.4 billion.","Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 basis points compared to last year. Primarily as a result of investments in store wages and labor hours in the U.S. Additionally, as CPA and compliance related cost were $30 million. Comprised of $22 million for ongoing inquiries and investigation, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year FCPA and compliance related costs were approximately $41 million.","The company's consolidated operating income decreased 8.8% to $5.7 billion. Excluding the impact from currency of approximately $214 million, operating income decreased by 5.4%. Primarily related to the factors that increased our operating expenses.","I'll close today's discussion with a few comments on returns. At Wal-Mart we remain committed to providing good returns for our shareholders. During last month's meeting for the investment community, we announced a new share purchase authorization of $20 billion, and said that our intention is to utilize this authorization over a two-year period. The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares for $437 million during the third quarter.","Return on investment ROI for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2015 was 15.9% versus 16.4% for the prior comparable period. The decline in ROI was primarily due to our decrease in operating income as well as continued capital investments.","Thank you for listening. And now I will turn it over to Greg. Greg?","Greg Foran","Thank you, Clair. Last month at our annual meeting for the investment community I spoke in detail about how Wal-Mart U.S. will execute our part of the plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience of scale. We will drive growth and deliver shareholder returns by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants, and providing our customers with the convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy. Although we are in the early stages of our journey we are confident in our plan and we are executing against it.","Now let's talk about our Q3 performance. As we've said before, we continue to measure our success in terms of traffic, in-stock and customer experience. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum in the top line. Net sales increased $2.7 billion or 3.8%. Unit sales picked up, and traffic strengthened improving 40 basis points from Q2 to 1.7%.","This is now the fourth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic growth for Wal-Mart U.S. Our comp sales growth of 1.5% was solidly within our guidance despite minimal food inflation. In-stocks improved while comp store inventory declined.","Our customers told us they are happy with the improvements we're making in the shopping experience as reflected in our customer experience scores. To date, 70% of our stores have achieved the initial goal we set for them. And we will raise the bar for next year. We also saw some progress this quarter in gross margin with the work we've put in on pharmacy markdowns and shrink. However, as we've discussed before, the investments in our stores and our associates are significant and will continue to pressure the bottom line.","All formats in our portfolio had positive comps this quarter. We are happy with the progress we've made in our Supercenters which saw continued traffic growth and positive comps across all areas except entertainment.","Our traditional format neighborhood markets delivered an approximate 8% comp in the third quarter. A 70 basis point acceleration from our Q2 comp and aided by strong performance in our less mature stores.","New technology and processes are improving end stocks and we're working hard on providing the best associate coverage to most effectively serve our customers. Most importantly, Fresh remains a key focus. We're encouraged by our newest prototype, which features better sightlines and displays. We've seen Fresh penetration expand in the store relative to its peers. We've made solid progress this year but we still have a ways to go to ensure we're creating the best experience for our customer while simultaneously improving the profitability of this format.","In e-commerce, we made strides on deepening the digital relationship with our customer. This quarter we accelerated our online grocery pickup offering to 85 additional locations. We now have almost 140 locations across 25 markets that offer the customer the ability to order their groceries online and conveniently pick up at a time of their choosing. We also launched a new mobile service which alerts us when a customer is coming to pick up their online general merchandise order even before they walk into the store. And just in time for the holidays, we introduced a digital wish list that can be built at home or by simply scanning items while at the store. E-commerce sales and traffic were softer than we would like. We'll continue to strive to balance sales growth and profitability. Overall, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 15 basis points to our comp.","From a merchandise perspective, we saw growth across most of the store, particularly in our apparel, hardlines, home and seasonal businesses. While warmer weather somewhat slowed performance in October, solid back to school and Halloween seasons, along with new launchers such as Pioneer Woman and STAR WARS drove mid-single-digit comps across each of these departments. Continued growth in prescription count and branded drug inflation drove mid-single-digit comps in Health and Wellness. As you see, it was also strong as better end stocks, particularly in Vitamins, helped drive sales.","In Food, we saw our best top line results of the year despite minimal inflation, which negatively impacted our total box comp by approximately 90 basis points. Momentum from a solid Labor Day weekend continued through to Halloween. We're particularly pleased with the results in Fresh, where we brought in new products, developed strong price leadership through strategic buys and promoted locally sourced and organic products.","While most of the box continued to grow, we still have considerable headwinds in Entertainment. A slow adoption of new technology in televisions and the shift from post-paid to installment wireless plans contributed to disappointing sales results. We're working on improving our operating model in this area both in terms of service to our customers and in the layout of the department. We've made some progress this year, including the recent remodel of the Rogers Akinsource [ph] supercenter we showed you last month, but it will take time to get this department where it needs to be.","Moving on to the remainder of our financials, gross margin increased 32 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables but was somewhat offset by declines in Health and Wellness. Reimbursement levels continued to pressure pharmacy profits; however, we've made some strides across several initiatives that improved margins in this department versus Q2. Additionally, we remain focused on our urgent agenda items, including better management of markdowns to zero. Finally, while only just beginning to show in our results, we are pleased with our efforts thus far on addressing shrink, which has been a significant headwind for us this year.","As we've said before, our top priority this year is to provide a better customer experience in our stores. We're committed to actions that help accomplish this goal as we have invested this year in our associates and in improving our stores. These investments are substantial and continue to reflect in our bottom line performance. Specifically in the third quarter, we intentionally added store labor hours above our initial plans and incurred significant maintenance expenses related to the customer-facing areas of the store. These investments, along with the wage increases and the store structure changes implemented earlier this year, drove the majority of the 116 basis point deleverage in operating expenses.","As the store experience is being addressed and efficiencies are created through new tools, technology and processes, we've begun calibrating labor hours against these improvements. Over time, as the productivity loop begins turning faster, we know we can create a strong balance between experience and profitability.","We did benefit this quarter from the immaterial lease accounting cumulative adjustment that Claire mentioned in her earlier remarks. Which favorably impacted operating expenses by $74 million.","As a result of our focus on improving customer experience, along with our ongoing investments in e-commerce, and somewhat offset by the lease accounting adjustment I just mentioned, operating income declined 8.6%. Excluding the impact from the lease adjustment, operating income declined approximately 10%.","Moving on, in the third quarter, total inventory grew around 1% which was less than half the rate of sales. Inventory declined approximately 1.9% from comp stores as new processes in technology have reduced inventory across the store while simultaneously improving in stock levels. We are proud of the progress we've made this year on improving inventory levels across our network, but we have room to improve and we remain focused on these efforts.","Finally, on the real estate side, we opened 15 Supercenters in the third quarter including relocations and expansions, and 35 traditional format neighborhood markets. We are working hard on improving both of these formats to ensure we have the best customer offering alongside strong operating efficiency. We'll continue to test ideas honing in on the best options for each of these formats.","Shifting now to the fourth quarter, the holiday season is upon us. Our associates have been working hard all year to prepare. And we ready. We have the best value on great merchandise for the entire season without gimmicks. Our merchants have done a terrific job of listening to our customers on what they are looking for this season. We are excited about programs such as Chosen by Kids and our exclusive one hour guarantee event. This holiday, we're working to bring our customers an improved shopping experience. Whether they are in the store, online or using our mobile app.","We know the holidays will be competitive. Additionally, we expect food inflation to remain low relative to last year, and will lap last year's significant drop in the fuel prices, which will make the comparison for the fourth quarter more difficult. But we're confident in our strategy and the actions we have taken, and believe they will help offset some of these pressures.","Therefore, for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016, we expect the comp sales increase of around 1% which would represent a 50 basis point improvement in our two-year comps stack from third quarter. Last year's fourth quarter comp was up 1.5% our strongest comp performance for fiscal 2015. And for last quarter an operating income growing faster than sales, both on a constant currency basis. Comp trends in Mexico and Canada continue to be strong which more than offset weaker performances in the U.K. Brazil and China. Where we continue to experience various competitive and economic challenges.","Our markets remain focused on the strategic priorities discussed earlier this year, which include, actively managing the existing portfolio, delivery balanced growth, including e-commerce, being the lower cost operator, and building solid foundations in terms of talent, trust and technology.","Let me touch on some of the progress we've made. We continue to take action this year to drive simplicity and focus in our portfolio. We sold a portfolio of properties under development with our shopping center joint venture partner in Canada. And exited our Bank operations in Mexico. We are currently pursuing the sale of a portfolio shopping centers in Chile. And we are closing our business-to-business sales operations in the U.K.","At the same time, we've looked for ways to enhance our portfolio in core markets which we've done by taking full ownership of Yihaodian in China, and acquiring 13 stores in 1 DC from a former competitor in Canada.","We'll continue to review our portfolio to simplify our operations and help our teams stay focused on running great businesses. Our markets continue to invest heavily in price, quality and service aimed at driving comp sales.","Our overall trend is improving, as seven of our eleven markets have now delivered positive comps for six straight quarters. We're delivering value and providing convenience that is attracting customers to our stores, clubs, websites and apps across our markets. I'm pleased with the innovation we're driving in e-commerce, led by online grocery, and I'm excited about the potential we have to access a broader customer segment. We continue to learn from our online grocery business in the U.K. as we test and roll out similar initiatives in Mexico and Canada and build a strong platform for growth in China.","As Doug mentioned, the continued economic challenges in some of our major markets impacted on our overall global e-commerce sales growth this quarter. We still have work to do but I'm confident we're executing against this key strategic priority.","Now let's discuss our overall results. In the third quarter, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 11.4%, impacted by an approximately $5 billion currency impact from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates continue to negatively impact our reported results, so it's important to emphasize that our business on a constant currency basis is maintaining steady growth. We had strong positive comp sales in Mexico and Canada. The U.K., Brazil and China posted negative comps, although the comps were slightly better in Q3 versus Q2. In each of our other markets, we had solid comps of at least 3%.","Operating income grew faster than net sales at 8.5% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by excellent performance in Mexico and Canada. In addition, as Claire mentioned earlier, there was an immaterial lease accounting adjustment this quarter which favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately $49 million on a constant currency basis. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 6.4%. On a constant currency basis inventory grew faster than net sales at 7%, primarily driven by our decision in Mexico to flow inventory through our import network early for the upcoming holiday season. On a reported basis inventory declined 10%.","Now let's discuss market results, presented on a constant currency basis for our largest markets. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Let's begin with the U.K. Challenging competitive conditions persisted throughout the quarter as the market continues to experience rapid structural change. Customers have now benefited from more than 12 months of continually falling prices and the market has grown by less than 1% for six consecutive months. Despite a healthy overall economy, according to Cantar, the big four grocers continue to lose share to the discounters.","U.K. net sales declined by 3.2% and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 4.6%. Large store traffic and food remain the primary challenges, while online grocery continues to grow. The online business is focused on improving its core service offering and is performing above target on key internal performance metrics. Operating income increased, driven by reduced expenses as well as lapping some organizational restructuring costs from last year. The U.K. is focused on rebuilding momentum in this core business. Last month we launched Project Renewal, an 18-month project that reaffirms the direction set out in the five-year strategy but prioritizes investments more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores while putting non-core expansion, such as remote petrol stations, on hold. Greater focus on driving out inefficiencies across both buying and operations will enable the U.K. to build on its well-established value credentials and strengthen its competitive position.","Let's now discuss Mexico, which released their earnings on October 27. Please note the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.4% with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico sales grew 7.6% and comp sales increased 6.3%. Driven by solid comp growth in both self-service and Sam's Club. In self-service we achieved mid-single digit growth in groceries and high single digit growth in GM and apparel. Self-service continues to gain share and delivered a 220 basis point improvement in market share according to ANTAD. Sam's Club is maintaining a steady improvement in comps aided by ongoing events and campaigns to drive traffic and grow membership. We leveraged expenses in the quarter and grew operating income significantly faster than sales.","Our e-commerce business in Mexico is growing in line with the market driven by strong growth in general merchandise. Under the Wal-Mart banner we're significantly expanding our assortment of ship-from-store items. We're rapidly growing store coverage for online grocery and customer orders are increasing. At Sam's Club we soft launched our new website while maintaining healthy growth with our existing platform. In Canada we continue to maintain solid growth and gain share in a competitive and low-growth environment. Net sales grew 5.7% and comps were up 4.3% driven by strong performance in the core grocery business as well as stronger performance in the GM business.","In the quarter, Canada saw share gains in food, health and wellness, consumables and infants for the 12 weeks ended October the 29th according to Nielsen. In addition to strong top line performance, the team continues to focus on our low-cost operating model to drive a sustainable price advantage. Canada grew operating income faster than sales.","We continue to invest in expanding customer access. We recently began a partnership with 7\/11 and a piloting, grab-and-go lockers at some of the convenience stores in the greater Toronto area. We are pleased with the progress with our online grocery business has made since our pilot launched in July. Overall, I'm pleased with our results in Canada and I expect reliable growth to continue. In Brazil, the economic challenges are largely unchanged as high inflation and unemployment continue to impact consumer confidence and consumption levels. Net sales were down 0.4% and comps were down 0.6% driven by decline in hypermarket format mostly offset by strong sales growth in our wholesale business General merchandise primarily electronics accounted for the largest portion of the hypermarket sales decline. These economic challenges are impacting both our store and e-commerce sales. Operating income declined faster than sales due to increased labor claims, continued high utility costs, and higher markdown activity which helped us improve our inventory position going into the fourth quarter.","Let's now shift to China, a key growth market. This quarter sales grew 2.9% driven by new store openings. Comp sales declined 0.7% in slower consumption growth. In the hypermarket channel, we gained share for an 11th consecutive quarter. We'll continue to invest in physical and digital to deliver a seamless shopping experience. We continue to drive efficiency in stores and at the home office. Operating income grew faster than net sales. We operate for less productivity initiatives remains a focus allowing reinvestment in labor and customer experience particularly in fresh.","Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China is focused on further leveraging Wal-Mart's global and local assets. The business improved margins and balanced marketing spend and their intense competition on price. While I'm not satisfied with recent results, I'm confident in the actions we're taking in China that position us to achieve success for many years to come.","Now let me recap. We had a good quarter with solid sales momentum in our underlying business driven by healthy comp sales in the majority of our markets. In addition, we delivered a relatively high level of constant currency operating profit. Our strategy remains focused and our priorities are clear and we're well-positioned for future growth.","Now I will turn it to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thanks, Dave. Today I'll share details about our third-quarter performance along with comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Members are at the center of the decisions we make and I'll talk about our ongoing efforts this year to deliver value for them. I'll also share with you specifics around our strategy, which is based on an in-depth review of the business that we've conducted this year.","Before I get started, let me recognize Charles Redfield for his many contributions to Sam's Club over the last three years as our Chief Merchandising Officer. His passion for merchandising was experienced throughout the organization. We are excited for Charles as he takes on his new role as Head Merchant for Food in the Wal-Mart U.S. business. With Charles's transition, we are thrilled to have John Furner back at Sam's Club as our new Chief Merchandising Officer after having served as the Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer in China for nearly three years.","Let's move on to a few specifics around our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.","Comp sales for the third quarter were at the low end of our guidance. In key food categories we faced comparisons to last year's steep inflationary environment, and in our Wireless business we continued to experience headwinds from changing industry dynamics. We saw positive results in areas of the business that introduced more newness such as Health and Wellness and Consumables. Net sales grew 1.6% as comp sales increased 0.4%. Slide 10 provides the components of our comp increase. Ticket grew 70 basis points during the period. Positive momentum in traffic from savings members continued, but softness from our business member negatively impacted our results.","Our gross profit rate increased 46 basis points from last year due to a disciplined focus on product acquisition costs, a favorable mix and logistics benefits. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter as we continued to invest in people and technology. We are confident that these are the right choices to make for our business and the benefits of these investments will help us deliver sustainable growth over time. Earlier you heard Claire talk about an immaterial item related to the company's accounting for certain leases, which resulted in a benefit to operating expenses of approximately $27 million for Sam's Club. We were pleased with the growth in membership income during the quarter, which increased 5.4%.","Investments in the cash rewards program for Plus members resulted in improved Plus renewal rates and Plus penetration is at an all-time high. The impact of social media campaigns was also a contributing factor.","Turning to our merchandising categories, let me talk about a few areas that had the most impact during the quarter. Please see slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories. Our Fresh, Freezer, Cooler business faced significant headwinds as deflation in key areas, including fresh meat and dairy weighed on our comps. We were pleased with our performance in produce.","Technology and Entertainment was pressured during the period, led by a decline in Wireless. The industry shift to installment plans continued to negatively impact the category. In Electronics, Imaging and Audio performed well and we continued our efforts to refine the assortment. Health and wellness and Consumables benefited from innovation and newness. In Pharmacy, the free $4\/$10 prescription program continued to drive growth in script count. New items in OTC led to a solid performance in the quarter and products like protein powder drove good results, further supporting our initiatives around Healthy For You.","Our Consumables business benefited as several new items were launched and we continued to gain share in Tabletop as the focus on private brands and quality resonated with members. In e-commerce we continued to make progress with integrating digital efforts to transform how members shop and interact with our clubs. Business members have enjoyed the convenience of pre-ordering merchandise for pickup at the club for more than a decade. Now, through advances in technology along with innovation from the e-commerce team, all of our members can enjoy similar access with an improved digital experience. This year's rollout of club pickup to all of our clubs has been well received and represents the fastest-growing area of our business.","Sales in the space increased to 50% during third quarter. We have also added features along the way. During the quarter, we completed the implementation of mobile check-in capability to provide members with a better experience and shorter wait times. We introduced yield sensing technology that alerts our associates when members drive onto the parking lot.","We extended drive-through or curb-side options to more clubs, and members love the convenience. These new features build on earlier advances in club pickup, including easier reorder and a prepaid option. Now let me move on to guidance for the fourth quarter.","As we move into the quarter we will face last year's inflationary environment and a tough comparison. As a result, we believe comp sales without fuel for the 13 week period ending January 29, 2016, will be flat to up 1%.","Members are at the center of the decisions we make. We've worked diligently this year to deliver on what we know they want. They expect offerings that are relevant and convenient. They want excitement and newness. They want a seamless shopping experience that integrates the best of digital and physical.","We see success where we are delivering on these expectations. For example, you've heard us talk about the expansion of organics in our assortment. Members ask for an improved selection, and we are delivering.","Over the summer we launched shocking values online, which has helped to instill a treasure hunt mentality with members. And the innovative free $4\/$10 prescription program is providing real savings to plus members and helping to lift the overall health and wellness category.","I am pleased with the steps we've been taking throughout this year to deliver for members. We know we must do more with member relevant merchandise and new member growth. Today, I'm excited to share with you the plans we've developed as we look ahead.","We have been focused on developing a strategy at Sam's Club that will deliver our business into the future and build long-term sustainable growth. The four key elements of our strategy include, growth through higher household income members in high-value business segments. Relevant merchandise and increase value for our members. Acquiring and retaining the right members and increasing the spend. And lastly, integrating digital to transform the club experience.","In order to better align the businesses as we move forward, we made organizational changes and enhancements. John Furner is returning to Sam's Club as Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer. John has rejoined the team after nearly three years of Chief Merchandising and Chief Marketing Officer of Wal-Mart China. Where he led merchandising, procurement, marketing supply chain, financial services and mobile commerce for the hyper-market division.","Prior to moving overseas, John was Senior Vice President of Home and Apparel Merchandise in Global Sourcing for Sam's Club. In addition, we've reallocated resources pertaining to merchandising, and have created new positions in critical areas including data and analytics, fresh food, regional buying and proprietary brands. We also created a new leadership position dedicated to business member merchandising.","Moving forward, we will continue to serve both savings and business members. We have clarity around the categories of members we will target. Data will drive our decisions, and we are confident we are focused on the right opportunities.","As I close let me summarize today's thoughts. As we look back at the third quarter we acknowledge that we need to improve our sales. Where we introduce new merchandise, we deliver strong results. We continue to make strategic investments in people and technology as these are critical enablers of our strategy. We are also pleased with our efforts to further integrate digital and physical retail. Our members are at the center of all of our decisions. We are making progress across the club and through online and mobile commerce capabilities to deliver value for them.","Whether it's saving them time with club pickup or saving them money on their prescriptions with free $4\/$10 we continue to find new ways to innovate. And we are confident the strategy and enhancement to our organizational structure will propel her business into the future. Now, I will turn the call over to Charles. Charles?","Charles Holley","Thanks, Roz. I'd like to start by highlighting that we are pleased with the sales increases we experienced at Wal-Mart U.S. as well as in our international business when considering constant currency. Stronger traffic in our Wal-Mart U.S. stores and a fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales indicate that we are taking the right steps to win with customers, grow sales and deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. From in e-commerce standpoint we have long-term plans in place to grow our business. We are making progress on several of our key initiatives and recognize we have more work to do. As expected, the investments we are making in people and technology impacted both operating expenses and profits in the quarter. However, we delivered earnings per share well within our guidance and remain confident that these investments will better position Wal-Mart for the future.","Now let's turn our attention to guidance for the fourth quarter and the full-year. Last quarter we indicated that we expected our full year fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share to range between $4.40 and $4.70. Today we are narrowing our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range between $4.50 and $4.65 including a range of $1.40 and $1.55 for the fourth quarter. These ranges include the assumptions we provided in the second quarter which consists of the impact of our investments in wages, training and additional labor hours in our stores, the incremental investment in global e-commerce and the headwinds in the U.S. from pharmacy margins and shrink.","Currency remains a significant headwind for us. As I indicated at our analyst meeting last month we expect our total net sales growth to be relatively flat for fiscal year 2016. It's important to note that if we were to exclude the impact of currency our total net sales growth would be around 3% for the year. Now, assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we now expect the full-year impact to earnings-per-share to be approximately $0.16 up $0.01 from last quarter's revised guidance of $0.15. Our effective tax rate is expected to range between 31% and 33% for the full year. As we've indicated in the past, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year.","Now as I've mentioned at our analyst meeting last month, we are monitoring progress in congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2014. If the legislation is passed we'll end up closer to the lower end of the updated range that we provided. As I mentioned at the October analyst meeting, we will continue to review our portfolio including stores and clubs. As in prior years, we may have charges related to closing businesses or stores and clubs. These charges would not be included in our guidance.","This is my last call as the Chief Financial Officer as I will be retiring effective January 31. I feel fortunate to be a small part of the Wal-Mart story. I've enjoyed working with all of you over the past few years. Brett Biggs will take over as the Chief Financial Officer for Wal-Mart effective January 1. You're in very capable hands and I'm proud of the strong team that we've left behind that Brett will be leading in the future.","With that, thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company, and on behalf of the management team and our associates worldwide, we thank you for your support this year and wish you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.","Operator","This call include certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","As amended, such forward-looking statements relate to management's guidance and forecast as to and expectations for, with respect to Wal-Mart as a whole, Wal-Mart's earnings per share for all of fiscal 2016 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; the total amount of Wal-Mart's investment in people in fiscal 2016 and that such investment will impact near-term operating income; Wal-Mart's positioning of itself in five key areas with such steps driving faster growth; Wal-Mart adding $45 to $60 billion of revenue in the next three fiscal years; Wal-Mart's total net sales growth for fiscal 2016 and Wal-Mart's total net sales growth for fiscal 2016 calculated, excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on Wal-Mart's earnings per share for fiscal 2016; the range of growth of Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales and merchandise value in fiscal 2016; the range of Wal-Mart's effective tax rate for fiscal 2016; the area in such range in which Wal-Mart's effective tax rate will fall if certain legislation is passed; Wal-Mart's effective tax rate fluctuating quarterly and factors that may affect such effective tax rate; Wal-Mart's investments in people and technology helping to deliver sustainable growth and returns to shareholders over time; Wal-Mart utilizing its $20 billion repurchase authorization over a two-year period; Wal-Mart's goals of being powered by 100% renewable energy, creating zero waste and selling products that sustain people and the environment; the number of visits to Wal-Mart's mobile shopping in November 2015 and December 2015.","With respect to Wal-Mart U.S., Wal-Mart U.S.'s comparable store sales for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016; Wal-Mart U.S.'s plan to be the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience for its customers at scale; Wal-Mart U.S. driving growth and delivering shareholder value by winning with stores, delivering value, being great merchants and providing its customers with a convenient shopping experience that is fast and easy; Wal-Mart U.S.'s investments in its stores and Associates continuing to pressure Wal-Mart U.S.'s bottom line.","With respect to Wal-Mart International, a project in Wal-Mart International's operations in the U.K., reaffirming the directions set out in the five-year strategy, prioritizing investment more clearly on price, quality and service in large stores and putting non-core expansion on hold; Wal-Mart International continuing to review its portfolio to simplify its operations; Wal-Mart International's operations in Canada continuing to have reliable growth; Wal-Mart International continuing to invest in its physical and digital retail operations in China.","With respect to Sam's Club, Sam's Club comparable club sales without fuel for the 13-week period ending January 29, 2016; the benefits of Sam's Club's investment in people and technology, helping Sam's Club deliver sustainable growth over time; Sam's Club strategy for delivering its business into the future and building long term sustainable growth, including the strategy's four key elements; and Sam's Club continuing to serve both savings and business members.","Assumptions on which any guidance or forecast as to and expectations for Wal-Mart and its segments are based are considered forward-looking statements.

Also, please save the date for our Investment Community Meeting, which will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon.","Doug McMillon","Good morning, everyone. As you may have seen this morning, we delivered a solid first quarter and we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. From my view, I\u2019d say that Walmart U.S. highlights were the 1.5% growth in comp traffic, comp store inventory being down over 7%, improved expense performance in our stores versus last year and the acceleration of e-commerce GMV growth to 69%.There were some other highlights outside the Walmart U.S. business that we\u2019ll touch on later.","Inside the Company, we can see that we\u2019re moving faster to combine our digital and physical assets to make shopping easier and more enjoyable for customers, but we can also see plenty of room to improve. We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we\u2019re capable of, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","I\u2019m really encouraged by how our store and club associates are embracing change. We\u2019re creating new solutions to help us run the business better in addition to creating a better experience for the customer in stores and online.","Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago while visiting stores in Oklahoma City I saw first-hand how the combination of some new in-store apps and mobile handhelds are improving our in-store processes and making life easier for associates. A grocery department manager in one store showed us how she now ensures side counter modular accuracy and in-stock with a new app we\u2019ve developed for our mobile handhelds. With this new app, the time to complete her work has now been reduced, improving her productivity and giving her more time to interact with customers. I saw it again last week in Omaha, Nebraska.","I saw another example in Canada in April. There, we\u2019ve an improved process at store level that is reducing inventory levels in the back room in a meaningful way. Our team is building better tools, our associates are embracing them and the results are improving. This is important because our key to winning starts with how we work inside the Company. We\u2019re transforming to become more of a digital enterprise. The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam\u2019s Club and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores. Online grocery also continues to perform well and we\u2019re on track to scale the offering to more stores this year in several countries, including the U.S. We\u2019re taking steps to save customers time as well as money.","Brett\u2019s going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area. Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. Comp store sales grew 1.4% and comp store traffic improved 1.5%. We got off to a slower start than expected, due in part to delayed federal tax refund checks, but saw sales strengthen throughout the quarter.","We also continued to manage the business well from an inventory and availability standpoint. I recently attended the grand opening of our 100th training academy in Edmond, Oklahoma. I met associates there who were new to Walmart and were quickly learning about our business. I also met associates who have been with us for 30, 35 and even 40 years, and they were learning about new processes and tools.","I\u2019m proud that we have lifelong learners at Walmart and I\u2019m excited about the training we\u2019re providing. We plan to graduate approximately 225,000 associates from our U.S. academies this year. Remember, 75% of our Walmart U.S. store management teams started as hourly associates, so it\u2019s critical we provide effective training for our associates as they take on more responsibility in our Company.","Overall, the store business is getting stronger and I\u2019m thankful to Greg Foran and the team for a thoughtful plan and the energy they\u2019re investing to lead the improvement. Greg, Marc Lore and the team continue to partner closely to serve our customers and figure out how to invent a seamless shopping experience for customers across our apps, sites and stores. They are plowing new territory and I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come.","In U.S. e-commerce, we like the traction and we\u2019re working hard to make even more improvements. Walmart.com launched two new initiatives in the quarter. First, we made the change to shipping terms at the beginning of the quarter. Customers don\u2019t have to pay a membership fee to get two-day shipping on millions of items.","Second, we recently began offering customers pick-up discounts on non-store items. Our stores are located within 10 miles of nearly 90% of the U.S. population, so this is convenient for many of our customers, and also saves them money when they order online and pick it up during their visit to our stores. Walmart.com now has 50 million first and third-party items to choose from compared to 10 million at this time last year, so our assortment continues to ramp.","We also made a few small, but strategic e-commerce acquisitions to further improve our assortment, while gaining critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel. The acquisitions have received a lot of attention, but our plan in e-commerce is not to buy our way to success. The majority of our growth is and will be organic. The acquisitions are helping us speed some things up. So overall, we\u2019re making progress in providing the seamless shopping experience our customer\u2019s desire and we will keep moving along this journey.","Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have hit the ground running. They\u2019re focused on members, merchandise and our associates. They achieved comp sales growth of 1.6% in the quarter led by 1.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 21%.","I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re ramping up our private brand offering with improved quality and compelling new items. We\u2019ve streamlined 20 private brands into one and will be introducing 300 new items this year that are branded Member\u2019s Mark. The team at Sam\u2019s Club is also taking important steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members.","Outside the U.S., Dave Cheesewright and the team continued to deliver solid results. Overall, constant-currency sales growth of less than 1% was negatively impacted by a couple of timing and divestiture related issues that Brett will discuss, but our underlying business continues to perform well.","At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was nearly 4% this year and 12% on a two-year stack. In April, I visited our businesses in China and Japan. China continues to be on fast-forward as it relates to all things digital including e-commerce. Operationally, our stores continue to improve and Sam\u2019s Clubs are doing well.","Working with JD.com and New Dada, China\u2019s largest local on-demand logistics and grocery O \u2013 to \u2013 O, short for online to offline, delivery platform, we now offer one-hour delivery service from 80 stores. This is an improvement from the two-hour service we launched last year. We can see the benefits of omni-channel retail even more clearly in China than any other country where we operate.","Given the urban density and automobile traffic challenges, stores serve the triple purpose of in-store shopping, pickup and delivery most effectively. I saw some similarities in Japan where stores are serving more than one purpose. In both markets, we\u2019re piloting the use of stores as shipping locations and we\u2019re learning what works best from a financial point of view in different types of store trade areas given how customer densities and travel distance can vary.","Moving on to Canada, our business continues to perform well, delivering 12 consecutive quarters of positive comp sales. We\u2019ve made some progress in the U.K. and the team is executing their plan. We are navigating our way back to a position of strength in that highly competitive market. When normalizing comp sales for the later Easter and Leap Day, we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.","For the overall segment, International had another solid, predictable quarter. The team has done a nice job of growing profit faster than sales as they simultaneously shift our positioning in terms of store formats, on line grocery and e-commerce.","In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with our start to the year. We have a clear strategy we\u2019re executing against. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to deliver value through both our physical and digital assets. We have momentum across the business. We\u2019re making progress and we know we\u2019re on the right track as we work to become the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you next month at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting here in northwest Arkansas. Thanks for being interested in our business.","Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As I\u2019ve been saying over the past few quarters, this an exciting time to be at Walmart, and we are delivering solid results. In the U.S., important initiatives are underway both to accelerate growth in e-commerce and drive traffic to our stores. Most of our key international markets continue to perform well, and top-line performance at Sam\u2019s Club remains solid.","On today\u2019s call I\u2019m going to cover our consolidated results from the first quarter, talk about e-commerce in the U.S. and then provide details on our operating segments. We will discuss the consolidated results in the context of our financial framework of strong, efficient growth, operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation.","Let\u2019s start with our consolidated results. EPS was $1, which is at the top end of our guidance of $0.90 to $1 and 2% higher than last year. This marks the first quarterly EPS increase in more than two years on an underlying basis. On a constant currency basis, total revenue increased 2.5% to $118.8 billion as we saw solid top-line performance across the business.","Walmart U.S. continued its momentum with comps of 1.4%, while Sam\u2019s Club posted comp sales, without fuel, of 1.6%. In Walmart International, 7 of our 11 markets reported positive comps, even as the timing of Easter and last year\u2019s Leap Day negatively impacted results.","The U.S. e-commerce GMV growth accelerated significantly, up approximately 69%. Through the lens of strong, efficient growth, I\u2019m pleased with the results. Gross profit margin increased 1 basis point during the quarter. The rate for Walmart U.S. was flat, while Walmart International was up slightly.","In regard to operating discipline, while we didn\u2019t leverage expenses on a consolidated level primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in our U.S. stores. We\u2019re making progress towards our objective of slightly leveraging expenses on a consolidated basis for the year.","We continued to generate strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter, $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash flow was down year-on-year primarily due to an increase in incentive payments, as well as a comparison against significant working capital improvements last year.","As we strategically allocate capital, our first priority is to invest in improving and growing the business. In the quarter, we completed remodels of 95 stores globally, and in the U.S. we continued to expand our online grocery service to include nearly 670 locations.","We also added a limited number of new stores, and made two relatively small acquisitions in the e-commerce space, Moosejaw and ModCloth, to expand our online selection and improve our category expertise in important areas like apparel and outdoor gear. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","Before I get to our operating segments, I\u2019ll talk about Walmart U.S. e-commerce. As a reminder, the results include all web-initiated transactions including those through Walmart.com such as ship to home, ship to store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.","Year-over-year growth in GMV was approximately 69%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through Walmart.com. This is extraordinary growth, and we\u2019re pleased with the traction we\u2019re generating across our e-commerce offerings.","We\u2019ve recently introduced free 2-day shipping with a basket size of $35 or more on select items, and launched a new service called Pickup Discount, where customers can order non-store products online and receive a discount for picking these items up in our stores. This is a service that\u2019s convenient for customers and saves them money.","Let\u2019s now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. You will recall in our fourth quarter comments that the first quarter started out slower than anticipated from a sales standpoint, due in part to the delayed issuance of federal income tax refund checks.","As anticipated, our sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, delivering comp sales growth of 1.4%, led by an increase in customer traffic of 1.5%. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. On a two-year stacked basis, comp traffic is up 3%. Average ticket declined slightly primarily due to lower sales of higher ticket items at the beginning of the quarter, as well as continued price investment.","Additionally, the grocery business continued to improve with food categories delivering the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in more than three years, due in part to a lack of market deflation in food, excluding price investments. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 80 basis points to the segment.","We were really pleased with our results for the Easter holiday period, as both food and general merchandise performed well. Gross margin rate was flat in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise and the acceleration of post-holiday markdowns taken in the fourth quarter benefited the margin rate, but this was offset by investments in price and the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business.","Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 14 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, I\u2019m pleased that we leveraged in the stores.","Operating income increased 0.9%, which is the first increase in more than three years. The team continues to do a fantastic job managing inventory. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 7.3%, while in-stock levels remained high. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.","Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. The International business continues to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered a solid start to the year. As I mentioned earlier, International performance was negatively impacted by one less operating day this year due to Leap Day last year, as well as the later timing of Easter this year.","Before we get into the results, let me discuss the financial impact, beginning in the first quarter, from strategic decisions we made previously to divest two businesses, Yihaodian in China and Suburbia in Mexico.","In the second quarter of last year, as part of the announced alliance with JD.com, we divested our e-commerce business in China, Yihaodian, except for the first-party piece of that business. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year we began to wind down the first-party business, with only a small amount of sales remaining at the end of the first quarter of this 10 year. This created a sales headwind versus last year of $385 million in the quarter and we expect a similar impact in each of the next couple of quarters until we lap the unwinding of the business.","Additionally, last month, Walmex announced it completed the sale of its apparel format, Suburbia. The gain from the sale of this business will be recorded in the second quarter of this year, and as a result, we expect a net benefit to EPS of approximately $0.05 in the quarter.","Beginning in the second quarter, and continuing throughout the remainder of this year, International\u2019s results will be negatively impacted by the operating profit lost due to the sale of the business. We expect a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.01 for the third and fourth quarters. We also expect a full year impact to sales of approximately $600 million. We\u2019ll continue to detail the impacts of these transactions as we go through the year.","Now, let\u2019s move on to the overall international results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 0.8%, and excluding Yihaodian, net sales increased 2.2%. Reported net sales declined 3.5%, impacted by a $1.2 billion currency headwind. From a profitability standpoint, first quarter operating income increased 9% on a constant currency basis and declined 0.1% on a reported basis.","During the quarter, a benefit to operating income of approximately $47 million from a land sale was recorded in one of our markets. Excluding this item, operating income would have increased 5% on a constant currency basis.","Let\u2019s now turn to some brief highlights of key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.","Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where sales momentum continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 5.2% and comp sales growth was 3.7%. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased over 13% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.","In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 1.5%. During the quarter, we reduced inventory levels even as sales increased, and according to Nielsen we continued to gain market share in key traffic driving categories like food and consumables & health and wellness. Continued planned investments in price and in-store efficiency initiatives are being supported by progress with our cost analytics program.","In China, net sales increased 0.7% and comp sales decreased 1.3%. In addition to the impact of one less day in the quarter due to Leap Day last year, sales were impacted by our strategic decision to reduce low margin bulk sales.","During the quarter, we continued to expand our e-commerce offering by entering new cities through our crowd-sourced delivery partnership with New Dada and now offer one-hour delivery from 80 stores. We also launched new product categories such as produce and frozen items on our Sam\u2019s Club flagship store on the JD.com platform.","Turning to the U.K., net sales increased 0.9%, while comp sales declined 2.8%. When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter this year, we continued to see sequential improvement in the underlying business, including customer traffic and ticket. We\u2019re confident we\u2019re on the right track. So, overall, our international strategy continues to produce consistent results, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year.","Let\u2019s turn to Sam\u2019s Club. At Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales, without fuel, increased 1.6% as traffic grew by 1.1%. We had good results across many of our categories, and comps have been positive for five consecutive quarters. We\u2019re also pleased with our digital growth as Club Pickup increased nearly 30%.","The team at Sam\u2019s is taking steps to simplify the business and give club managers more time on the floor to serve members. The initiatives underway at Sam\u2019s are designed to grow membership and sales, and we know it all starts with member experience. We\u2019ll deliver for them through our efforts to lead in digital and provide unmatched value on great merchandise. For the 13-week period ending July 28, 2017, we expect comp sales, without fuel, to increase between 1% and 1.5%.","With that, let\u2019s discuss total company EPS guidance. We feel good about the momentum across the business and expect progress to continue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect EPS, excluding the gain from the sale of Suburbia, to be between $1 and $1.08.","In closing, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the important work you do every day. As a Company, we\u2019re moving with speed and executing against the strategy we\u2019ve outlined, and it\u2019s all happening through the lens of our financial framework. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Shareholders\u2019 meeting in a few weeks.","Unidentified Company Representative","This call includes certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the third quarter of fiscal 2013. All information for this quarter, including our unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website, new address, stock.walmart.com.","Please note that while we update unit counts on a monthly basis on our website, in the earnings discussion today, units and square footage are referred to as of the quarter end. Our press release is available on the website, and a full transcript of this call has already been posted there.","Here's the agenda for today's call. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter, as well as highlights of our key results. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll cover the operating segments: first, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International; and Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club. We'll close the call with our CFO, Charles Holley. He'll cover growth, leverage and returns, as well as provide our outlook for the remainder of the year.","A number of you have asked about the potential impact of a 53-week year on our business. Let me remind you that unlike other retailers whose fiscal year coincides with a retail calendar, Walmart's fiscal year ends always on January 31. Walmart only reports comp store sales on a 4-5-4 basis for the U.S. segments.","During last year's Q4 call, we stated that we would report fiscal 2013 comp store sales on a 53-week basis with 4-5-5 reporting for Q4. But to align with our company's internal operating systems this year, Walmart will now report Q4 on a 4-5-4 basis, so we will not recognize a 53-week retail calendar this year.","Next year, fiscal 2014, we'll report comp store sales on a 53-week basis with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. We ask that you please adjust your models accordingly.","Within Walmart U.S., we discuss layaway. The revenue and comp sales associated with merchandise put on layaway is not recognized until the merchandise is completely paid for and picked up by the customer. Therefore, the vast majority of third quarter layaway transactions will be recognized in the fourth quarter.","In discussing our operating results, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates that we use to convert the operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Throughout our discussion today, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. When we refer to constant currency operating results, we're referring to our operating results without the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and without the impact of acquisitions until those acquisitions are included in both comparable periods. The disclosure of constant currency amounts or results allows investors like you to better understand our underlying performance without the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.","When we use the term gross profit, we're referring to actual dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit rate, refers to the percentage obtained by dividing gross profit by net sales dollars. All comparisons are calculated as the change between the current quarter and the prior year quarter, unless we state otherwise.","In all references to earnings per share, or EPS conversationally, we really mean diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.","One last point before we get to the earnings details. Additional information regarding our company's review of certain matters related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is included in our Form 8-K dated November 15, 2012, regarding our earnings release. These documents are available on both the Walmart corporate site that I mentioned earlier and the SEC website.","So let's get on to our results. Mike Duke will kick off the news for the third quarter. Mike?","Michael Terry Duke","Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our financial performance for the third quarter and the dedication and hard work of our associates serving Walmart customers and communities around the world.","Earnings per share were $1.08, which represents an 11.3% increase over the third quarter last year.","At our October Analyst Meeting, you heard me talk about our disciplined approach to operating the business, the productivity loop and making investments. That discipline enabled the company to deliver really good profitability and expense leverage in a quarter of continued economic uncertainty for our customers.","Here are some of the highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $113.2 billion, a 3.4% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have been almost $115 billion, an increase of roughly 5%. Consolidated operating income was up 4% from last year, again growing faster than sales. Return on investment was 18% and among the best in the retail industry. These results are a credit to the operating segments that drive our bottom line performance.","So now I'll get into their key takeaways. Walmart U.S. posted a comp sales increase of 1.5% and delivered approximately $2.3 billion in net sales growth. Back-to-school activities drove sales early in the quarter, and the mid-September launch of layaway was important in helping customers. Operating income outpaced net sales growth for the quarter and was a key driver of our overall company profit.","Bill and his team are executing very innovative plans to drive traffic and to help America's families have a great holiday season. That's what our customers expect, and we will deliver.","We announced our extended Black Friday program, and customers are already working on their shopping list. Price will continue to be a major factor for customers over the holidays. Our strong price position and broad assortment are clear competitive advantages in an economy where customers may still be cautious with their budgets.","Sam's Club posted a comp sales increase of 2.7% for the quarter without fuel. I'm pleased that Sam's delivered a 12.7% increase in operating income for the quarter. As you heard from Roz at the October meeting, there's still more work to do to accelerate membership income. I like the test the team is conducting in our Texas clubs, and we will continue to evaluate the results over the next several months. Sam's has also launched its price investment strategy and you can expect to see more of that in the fourth quarter.","Walmart International grew net sales 2.4% to $33.2 billion for the quarter despite a negative impact from currency and a challenging global economy. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased a healthy 7.6% over last year. International grew or maintained market share in its major markets except for China. We're maintaining our focus on improving profitability and returns, especially in Brazil and China. The focus that Doug and his teams have on driving comp sales through EDLP, lowering expenses and delivering leverage is moving us down the path to continue to grow and gain market share.","Across all of our markets, we are seeing the same price consciousness as we do in the U.S. More and more of Walmart's customers are part of a growing global middle class. They're looking for quality, value and a better life, and our EDLP model reinforces our competitive positioning.","I recently spent a week visiting 3 of China's major cities: Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. While China's rate of growth has slowed, it's clear that a new generation of consumers is creating an immense retail market, and that includes a significant opportunity in eCommerce. We recently completed our 51% investment in Yihaodian, which will enable us to serve more Chinese customers online. We are now well positioned to grow with Chinese consumers whether they shop online or in stores.","Global eCommerce sales are growing, and we will continue to make the right investments to strengthen an already good business. We've made significant progress this quarter in enhancing our walmart.com site for U.S. customers. The walmart.com search engine is improving conversion. We are enhancing eCommerce opportunities for shoppers in the U.K., Brazil and China, including a global platform that increases the assortment on our key online sites. We will continue to build the anywhere, anytime relationship that customers want and that sets us apart from retailers operating only in the e-commerce space.","I want to thank our associates for being there for our customers. When the superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast, our associates jumped into action. The Walmart trucks rolled in, delivering water, food, blankets and other needed items. We have pledged $2 million to help with relief efforts. We will continue to do our part in the recovery, and we appreciate the kind words and the recognition from New York Governor Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Christie.","We also continued to demonstrate our commitment to lead on social and environmental issues. At a recent event in Beijing with government officials, NGOs, academics and suppliers, I announced new goals for how we will use the Sustainability Index to design more sustainable products, to make our global supply chain more socially and environmentally responsible and to incent merchants to make sustainability a bigger part of their day-to-day jobs. We will continue to drive sustainability deeper into our operations as this makes us a stronger business.","Our fundamentals are strong, and we are well positioned for the fourth quarter. We expect a very competitive holiday season and we are ready for it. Our teams across all 3 segments have done a great job working with our suppliers around the world to ensure that we are well stocked and offering the broadest assortment at the lowest prices in our stores and online.","On behalf of everyone at Walmart, I wish you happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a great New Year.","And now, I'll turn it over to Jeff for the financial details. Jeff?","Jeffery Davis","Thank you, Mike. As Mike just mentioned, Walmart reported EPS of $1.08, which was within our guidance of $1.04 to $1.09 and compared to $0.97 last year. While the current quarter benefited from a 31.3% effective tax rate, this benefit was substantially offset by approximately $105 million in pretax charges, which are included in operating expenses. More specifically, they are an approximate $69 million for charges in estimated contingent liabilities related to employment claims in Brazil and an approximate $36 million for damages from superstorm Sandy, mainly in our Walmart U.S. business.","Now let's cover the details on the third quarter's consolidated results. Net sales increased 3.4% or $3.7 billion to $113.2 billion for the third quarter. Our net sales included a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1.7 billion. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 4.9% to $114.9 billion.","Total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, were 1.7% for the 13-week period ended October 26. In a few minutes, Bill and Roz will discuss the comp performance for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club.","Membership and other income grew 2.1% compared to third quarter of last year. Therefore, the combination of net sales and membership and other income, which we refer to as total revenue, was $113.9 billion, up 3.4% from $110.2 billion last year.","Consolidated gross profit rate was 24.5%, a 13-basis point reduction compared to the same time last year. You will hear more from our segment CEOs regarding their price investment in just a few moments.","Now let's move our attention to leverage. We have 2 stated goals with respect to leverage: first, to grow operating expenses at a rate less than net sales growth; and second, to grow operating income at a rate greater than the net sales growth.","With respect to operating expenses, the company leveraged expenses by 17 basis points, which covered the 13-basis point investment in gross profit rate. We are pleased to have delivered operating leverage for the quarter despite the $105 million in pretax items I mentioned earlier.","Other unallocated expenses grew 16.4% during the quarter. Recall that other unallocated has 3 components: core corporate, Global eCommerce and global leverage services.","Now let's take a moment to review the overall increase. Within our core corporate, we recognized approximately $48 million in charges related to third-party advisors reviewing matters involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Please note that this amount is higher than our previously stated quarterly estimate of $35 million to $40 million. However, we expect these expenses to continue through the fourth quarter at our previously stated estimate of $35 million to $40 million. Excluding this item, core corporate would have decreased by approximately 1.9%, and I'm happy to say that year-to-date, core corporate would only be up 1% versus last year. We will continue to invest in Global eCommerce and global leverage services as these areas will contribute greater growth and improved leverage in the future.","This brings us to consolidated operating income in our second stated leverage goal. Third quarter consolidated operating income was $6.1 billion, an increase of 4%, which is also greater than the rate of net sales growth of 3.4%.","Debt to total capitalization was reduced to 43.7% versus 46.9% last year. This improvement was driven by strong operating cash flows, which allowed us to reduce our leverage.","Our balance sheet and credit rating remain very healthy, and we continue to have ample access to debt capital markets.","As referred to previously, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate as it may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. This was the case with our third quarter effective tax rate. The rate of 31.3% compares to last year's effective tax rate of 34.5%. However, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be at the lower end of our previous guidance of 32.5% to 33.5%.","This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $3.6 billion, an increase of 8.7% from last year. Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in the third quarter. During the quarter, we added approximately 13 million retail square feet through 173 net new, expanded and relocated units. You've heard us talk about capital discipline being an even greater priority. I'm pleased to report today that, year-to-date, capital expenditures are $8.9 billion versus $9.5 billion last year. Later on the call, Charles will provide an update on the total company CapEx forecast for fiscal 2013.","Free cash flow was $7 billion for the 9 months ended October 31, 2012. Let me say that again. $7 billion, which was an increase of more than $3.5 billion compared to last year. The increase was primarily a result of timing of payments of accrued incentives, improved operating results and disciplined investment.","Now let's move to returns. The company paid $1.3 billion in dividends to its shareholders for the quarter and $4 billion year-to-date. In addition, the company repurchased approximately 16.6 million shares for the quarter and 71 million shares year-to-date, totaling approximately $1.2 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.","Through the combination of dividends and share repurchase, Walmart returned $2.5 billion to shareholders for the quarter and $8.7 billion year-to-date.","Consolidated inventory grew 7.1% compared to last year, and you'll hear more about inventory investments from each of our segment CEOs.","And finally, return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2012, was 18% compared to 18.2% for the previous year. It should not surprise you that our capital discipline benefited ROI. However, this benefit was mostly offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations.","Now, let's turn it over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?","William S. Simon","Thank you, Jeff. Let me start by saying how pleased I am with the performance of our U.S. business. We've aligned the business around an effective strategy fueled by the productivity loop, and we continue to produce consistent financial results.","During the quarter, we again delivered solid sales across the business. Comp sales increased 1.5% as we lapped a positive 1.3% comp last year. Year-to-date, we delivered almost $4 billion in comp sales growth. The earlier launch of our expanded layaway program generated approximately $300 million in additional third quarter volume versus last year, most of which we will recognize in the fourth quarter when the customers pay for and pick up the merchandise.","With average fuel prices up approximately 6% versus this time last year, some customers are consolidating their shopping trips. Traffic was up approximately 0.1%, but we were particularly encouraged by the 1.4% lift in ticket given the continued downward inflationary trends in some food and electronics categories. We're also encouraged by the continued increases in market share across food, consumables and over the counter combined, with overall third quarter share in these categories increasing 50 basis points versus last year, according to Nielsen.","We had positive comps across all geographies and store formats. During the quarter, we focused on being the destination for back-to-school and Halloween shopping. Our merchants and operators developed a strong cross-functional plan, and I'm pleased with our execution and the sales growth achieved this year. As a reminder, a slightly larger portion of Halloween sales versus last year will fall into the fourth quarter comp period given how the 4-5-4 calendar falls this year.","Similar to other retailers, we were impacted by superstorm Sandy. We recognized approximately $35 million of expenses related to inventory damage, cleanup and other miscellaneous items. Our dedicated associates responded quickly to reopen about 75% of approximately 300 impacted stores within 24 hours of closing, with all stores now fully operating.","In addition to our $2 million pledge in relief support, we partnered with the governors of New York and New Jersey to bring additional water, food and supplies to those on the East Coast. We take pride in our ability to aid our customers and their families in these difficult circumstances. I want to thank our associates for their relentless support during this time.","I'm inspired by the work of our associates in the field who were behind all of our results. In our annual engagement survey conducted this summer, the Walmart U.S. associate engagement scores rose 400 basis points over last year. Our financial results drove another quarter of strong field incentive payouts for hourly associates. Year-to-date, our associates will have received over $550 million in quarterly incentive payouts.","Also, we continue Walmart's long history of developing talent within our stores. During the last year, we promoted approximately 165,000 associates, affording them additional career advancement.","Our teams are ready for Christmas and the holidays, and we appreciate their passionate dedication to serving customers. As you probably know, our associates receive a 10% discount on general merchandise bought at Wal-Mart Stores all year long. And each year, we provide our associates with an additional special holiday discount with 10% off most food items during the month of December. This year, we've expanded the program by starting 2 weeks earlier.","In addition, many of our associates work tirelessly to execute our Black Friday event. This year, we're providing an additional 10% discount on an entire basket of goods for those associates who are giving up a bit of their Thanksgiving holiday to better serve their customers. We've started planning early, and we'll provide our customers with an efficient and enjoyable holiday shopping experience.","Now let's turn to the financial details of the third quarter. Walmart U.S. delivered net sales of $66.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion or 3.6% over last year.","Gross profit increased $443 million versus last year to $18.3 billion. During the third quarter, gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points year-over-year as we continued to reduce margin and execute the strategic price investments.","We also continue to significantly leverage expenses. For the quarter, operating expenses grew only 1.8%, half the rate of sales growth. Even with the impact of higher field incentive payouts this quarter, our team leveraged operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 37 basis points.","Solid sales performance and disciplined expense management helped us deliver $4.8 billion in operating income for the quarter, a 4.5% increase year-over-year and a growth rate 90 basis points higher than our sales growth rate.","Inventory grew at 4.3% over last year as we prepare to serve our customers during the holiday season. As we said, we bought deep in areas that matter to our customers, and we'll have the products they want. We're in a strong inventory position and well prepared for the fourth quarter.","Before I cover the results of our merchandise areas, let me remind you that the vast majority of layaway sales are deferred until the fourth quarter and are not reflected in our business unit comps discussed here.","Our grocery business, which includes food and consumables, delivered a low-single digit positive comp. We continue to execute our strategic price investments, driving price separation versus our competition. Overall grocery inflation continued to moderate and was approximately 50 basis points versus approximately 400 basis points last year.","In food, our broad and localized assortment is resonating with the customer as demonstrated by our continued strength in areas like dry grocery. In addition, strategic initiatives like our USDA steak program continue to produce encouraging results with mid-single digit comp sales over a 39-week year-to-date period exceeding the overall food comp by about 250 basis points.","In the third quarter, our food business also delivered strong performance across the key seasonal events including Labor Day, back-to-school and Halloween.","Customers also responded well to the consistent execution of our consumables strategy, driving all departments to positive comps for the quarter. Assortment refinements, such as an emphasis on larger packs, helped deliver additional value for our customers. For instance, value pack sizing and other assortment additions helped increase our market share in pets by about 100 basis points versus last year.","Health & Wellness continued its trend, generating a low-single digit positive comp. Over the counter remained very strong as our broad assortment and continued focus on opening price point drove traffic gains and unit growth. Customers are finding value in our broader assortment of active nutrition products like whey protein and meal supplement bars. As expected, brand-to-generic conversions continued to pressure top line sales, but conversions of LIPITOR and other brands continue to improve pharmacy margins.","Comp sales in Hardlines increased by low-single digits. We continue to see steady good performance in stationery, crafts and sporting goods. Sporting goods had strong performance due to expanded hunting assortment, including guns and ammunition. The addition of key hardlines categories to layaway was attractive to customers who also purchased items not on the layaway list.","In discussing entertainment, it's important to note that layaway plays a big part in sales of this business as many customers look to our assortment of top brands across the categories. An early start to layaway and new items helped drive additional customers to the business. Within entertainment, the interest in layaway resulted in approximately $200 million of incremental layaway volume versus third quarter last year. Top items on layaway included 50-inch televisions, gaming consoles and tablets.","The continued strong industry deflation led to a low-single digit negative comp for entertainment. Within wireless, a broader assortment resulted in double-digit comp sales growth as customers continue to look at Walmart as a wireless destination. In media and gaming, we're well positioned for a very strong release schedule throughout the fourth quarter. Top releases like Halo and Call of Duty drove customers into our store over the last several weeks.","Layaway drove a great deal of interest in toys, including toy construction, educational toys, ride-ons and bicycles. We're well stocked in this season's must-have toys and will be able to delight our younger customers all season long.","Our apparel business posted a low-single digit comp increase, making this the third straight quarter of positive comps. The consistency of our apparel business and focus on basics, especially in kids, ladies and men's continues to drive growth despite the impact of a warm October across much of the country. We have worked hard on improving item quality, focusing on the elements that our customers appreciate and are optimistic that our current trend will continue into the holiday season.","Home drove a low-single digit positive comp, benefiting from item merchandising, innovation and assortment refinement. We're seeing consistent results across home, making this the fourth straight quarter of positive comps. Home is another area that's benefiting from our expanded offering this year with improved quality in virtually all categories. Our customers are asking for more layaway items, so we added a number of small appliances, including many customizable solutions like the Keurig and SodaStream brands.","At Walmart.com, improved checkout capabilities and increased assortment continued to drive sales and strengthen the customer experience. Polaris, our search engine developed in-house by our technology teams, is improving conversions by 10% to 15%. In October, we announced our same-day delivery pilot in 4 cities with customers receiving their orders within hours of placing an order.","Our broader dotcom business is also growing as price investment and other initiatives drove additional sales across several categories, including grocery, Hardlines, electronics and apparel.","In mid-October, our financial services team launched an innovative checking and debit alternative called Bluebird. Designed from the ground up with our partner, American Express, Bluebird offers our customers premium features and benefits without additional fees. Bluebird is a simple and transparent way to manage your money and another example of how we're providing uniquely Walmart solutions to help our customers live better. We're encouraged by the positive reception and early adoption of Bluebird among our customers and are tracking above our plan in terms of new accounts and customer activity. We look forward to continuing our momentum together with American Express.","As you know, we're proud of our productivity initiatives and our ability to continually improve our business through efficiency and innovation. In the third quarter, our logistics team reduced cost per case shipped by 4.2% excluding the impact of fuel. Our store innovations team also continues to develop and implement initiatives that will help ensure we reach our expense savings goals this year and into the future.","We continue to have a robust pipeline of real estate as we execute our growth strategy across both large and small formats over the next few years. During the third quarter, we opened 59 Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. Supercenters remain a strategic growth vehicle as we continue to develop our core markets.","We also continue to accelerate growth in our small formats, which now represent approximately 250 units. In the third quarter, we opened another 33 Neighborhood Markets across the country. This is in addition to the 23 we opened in the first half of the year. The format's flexibility allows us to grow coast-to-coast with an eye towards localizing it for the particular community. This quarter, we opened 15 stores in California, as well as new units in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Denver, Colorado Springs, Seattle, Portland and Miami, just to name a few.","For Neighborhood Markets, customer traffic in comp stores continued to drive growth, led by sales in Rx, over the counter, adult beverages, meat and consumable areas such as pets. We continue to see the Neighborhood Market format competing very effectively against multiple channels with a year-to-date sales comp in the mid-single digits.","Our Express pilot also continues to perform well. We'll continue our density test into next year and we'll be actively applying these learnings as we continue to roll out small formats.","We're on track to deliver approximately 125 Supercenters and approximately 80 small stores this fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we plan to open 40 to 50 total new units, including 20 to 25 small stores.","Walmart will be the #1 holiday destination this year. We started planning the day after Christmas last year to win this holiday season. In food, our Bake Centers and meal trains provide the capacity and convenience our customers need to stock up for entertaining all in one easy trip.","Across our general merchandise departments, we're well stocked on the items that matter most, and programs like our Ad Match Guarantee ensure that customers will get the lowest prices at Walmart.","We have a comprehensive marketing plan that's designed to ensure we have the #1 share of voice this season. We're increasing our presence across traditional media channels with big increases in TV and radio. We have some great holiday commercials lined up that will be fun, but more importantly, reinforce our price leadership. Additionally, we'll generate over 2 billion impressions across social media this holiday, more than 3x last year's total.","Throughout the year, we worked closely with our suppliers to set our stores 3 weeks earlier than last year and engaged our customers and associates like never before. The layaway program is a great example. Our customers gave us great feedback, and we improved the program by eliminating the layaway fee, extending the time frame for payments and expanding the categories.","We're so excited about our annual Black Friday event and how it will drive sales throughout the entire holiday season. Our customers asked for an earlier start time. So this year, the event begins at 8 p.m. on Thursday. The first event will have unbeatable deals for the entire family in key areas like toys, gaming, home and apparel. At 10 p.m., we'll highlight special deals in electronics that will excite our customers. And let me point out that we're far deeper on the quantities of those items than we've ever been before. We'll continue through Friday and into the weekend with more great prices on key gift items across the entire store.","We know that one of the most important things for our customers is getting the items they want under their Christmas tree. That's why in addition to amazing prices backed by our Ad Match Guarantee, we're also offering an exclusive 1-hour guarantee for our Black Friday customers this year. This groundbreaking program ensures that our event shoppers who are in line between 10 and 11 p.m. that night will be able to buy one of this year's hottest gifts, including a 32-inch TV, a Blu-ray player and an iPad, all at our special low prices. This is just one more way we're delivering a great holiday season for our customers.","We're excited about the fourth quarter and pleased with the performance of the business so far this year. Our strategy is working and producing results across all geographies and business units. November sales have started ahead of plan, and we expect strong performance through Thanksgiving and Black Friday.","For the fourth quarter, we're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from October 27, 2012, through January 25, 2013, to range from 1% to 3%, maintaining our recent trend over the past several quarters. As a reminder, we'll continue to lap positive comps with last year's fourth quarter comp being 1.5%.","Our business is strong, and we'll continue to deliver consistent core growth. We look forward to seeing you in our stores this holiday season.","Doug is up next with an international update. Doug?","C. Douglas McMillon","Thank you, Bill. Walmart International had solid results for the third quarter. In some markets, we faced a more challenging economic environment than in the first half of the year. But with the exception of China, we grew share everywhere we operate. I'm proud of the good work our associates are doing to drive those results. They're managing costs and doing what is necessary to deliver value to our customers, and it's as clear as ever that they need it.","For the International segment, net sales were $33.2 billion, up 2.4% over last year's third quarter. We're now reporting the results of Massmart and our purchase of the Netto stores in the U.K. in our comparative results. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $1.7 billion. Operating expenses were up 3%, and we would have leveraged operating expenses without the expense for the estimated contingent liabilities relating to employment claims in Brazil that Jeff mentioned earlier.","Operating income was $1.5 billion, up 4.8% compared to the third quarter of last year and grew faster than sales. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased operating income by $29 million.","Let me go through the numbers on a constant currency basis. First, third quarter net sales would have been up 7.6% to $34.8 billion. Our Latin American markets made the strongest contribution to our net sales growth with all countries in the region delivering positive comp sales. Overall, third quarter comp store sales increased in 4 of our 6 largest markets. In general, we're delivering healthy average ticket increases, but comparable store traffic remains a concern and it declined in the third quarter in our major markets. We're focused on improving our customer communications in all of our markets, but we're especially focused on the markets where consumer spending is under the most pressure such as in Japan and the U.K.","Second, operating expenses were up 8.3%, and without the employment claim contingency, we leveraged operating expenses.","And third, on a constant currency basis, operating income was $1.5 billion, up 6.8%. Without the Brazilian employment claim contingency, we would have grown operating income 12.5% and faster than the 7.6% sales increase. So our underlying results were solid.","Inventory was up 13.5% against our sales growth of 2.4%. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew 10.7% on sales growth of 7.6%. Inventory days on hand were well managed in Canada, China, Japan, Central America and Argentina. We weren't pleased with our inventory in relation to sales in our other major markets.","Now let's get into the results for several of our largest markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis, and unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on a calendar basis.","Let's begin with EMEA, our region that includes the U.K., Canada and Sub-Saharan Africa. The U.K. had a solid third quarter in a very challenging market. As others have reported, U.K. consumers remain hard-pressed economically. Petrol prices remain a factor with average fuel prices in the U.K. at GBP 1.38 per liter.","In the third quarter, ASDA's sales rose 2.5%, ahead of the market. Comparable sales were down 0.4%, excluding fuel. Average ticket in the quarter increased by 0.9% while traffic decreased by 1.3%. Operating income grew slightly slower than sales.","We increased our market share in the U.K. 10 basis points to 17.5% for the 12 weeks ended September 30 according to the Kantar Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll.","During the quarter, we maintained our commitment to EDLP, investing in price reductions of key food commodities to provide our customers with much-needed relief from their financial pressures. At the same time, we've continued to drive strong multi-channel growth with a focus on improving the online shopping experience. Customers now have access to the full George and general merchandise offerings at the click of a button with next-day delivery available.","We've also commenced the rollout of Wi-Fi in all stores, allowing customers free access. Online sales increased 16.2% in the quarter versus last year.","We continue to leverage the We Operate for Less program, achieving savings within both SG&A and cost of goods sold. This helped deliver an increase in gross profit rate in the quarter from last year. However, operating expenses grew ahead of sales due to pressures in areas such as property taxation.","Having been The Grocer 33 lowest priced supermarket for 15 of the last 20 weeks and with its best ever range of Chosen By You and Extra Special private brand products, we move into the holiday quarter with confidence.","Moving to Canada. Walmart Canada had good sales growth and grew operating income faster than sales. Net sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter compared to last year. Comparable sales increased 0.7% with average ticket up 1.7% and traffic declining 1%. We had strong comp sales in food and consumables and Health & Wellness, but weakness in Hardlines and entertainment. Gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins and lower markdown activity. However, expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to preopening costs associated with aggressive real estate expansion plans. We've completed 49 projects to date with 24 projects to be completed by year end. We now have 30 of our 39 Zellers to Wal-Mart Store conversions opened and the early results are encouraging. We're pleased with the way the Canadian leadership team managed this conversion process and it appears our new customers are, too.","Canada is heading into the golden quarter with plans to make this a memorable season for Canadians. Canada will kick-start the season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday promos as we did last year. Our Top 20 Toy digest will give customers a best-in-class offering for the holiday season gift buy and Our Finest private brand selection, a new Walmart Canada brand that was recently named by Progressive Grocer magazine as Best New Product for a Mass Merchandiser, will be a favorite for festive celebrations.","Turning to Africa. Massmart continues to deliver strong performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Let me remind you that while Walmart is a majority shareholder, Massmart remains publicly traded and conforms to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange guidelines of reporting results on a 6-month basis.","This quarter, we reached the anniversary of our acquisition of Massmart and now report comparable results for the quarter. For the 14 weeks ended September 30, net store sales increased by 16.6%, and comparable store sales increased by 7.8%. We continue to be excited about the opportunities with Massmart and Sub-Saharan Africa. We are leveraging best practices and scale advantages in everything from EDLP to supply chain and sourcing strategies.","Moving on to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex reported numbers.","Walmex delivered solid results with consolidated net sales for the third quarter up 10.7% and consolidated operating income growing 14.6% from last year. Mexico's net sales were up 11%, and comparable store sales were up 5%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 5.8% and traffic decreased 0.8% over last year. Comparable sales in Mexico for self-service formats grew 4.8%. ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew slower at 4.4%. As a reminder, ANTAD is the national association of supermarkets and department stores and provides industry data and market share analysis.","In Central America, overall sales increased 9.4%, and comp sales were up 3.2%.","Third quarter consolidated gross profit rate for Walmex increased by 49 basis points, primarily due to seasonal merchandise flow. Walmex leveraged consolidated operating expenses on store productivity initiatives, and operating income grew faster than sales.","We are ready for the upcoming start of the Christmas season. This is the second year in which Mexico has its version of Black Friday, called El Buen Fin, and it starts tomorrow and runs through November 19. We're offering an attractive and differentiated value proposition for our customers across our different formats. Our stores and our people are ready to win during this season.","Moving on to Brazil. Third quarter sales grew 11% from last year. Comparable sales increased 6.6% with average ticket up 9.8% and traffic down 3.2%. The average ticket increase continues to be an encouraging sign that customers see the value of our price positioning, and we'll continue to demonstrate price leadership on a broad basket of goods.","Our customers are benefiting from the simplification and efficiencies that EDLP brings to our retail formats. We're focused on traffic for our retail stores and expected to see more improvement in this area by this time. We believe the full conversion to EDLP will be completed by the end of next year as we continue to roll it out in our wholesale formats.","Brazil did not leverage operating expenses in the third quarter, primarily due to the employment claim contingencies discussed earlier. The ongoing focus that the management team has on reducing expenses is helping to improve Brazil's operating income. Brazil achieved cost reductions in areas including advertising, workforce management and freight optimization. And without the employment claim contingencies, Walmart Brazil would have been profitable for the quarter.","Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile remains a publicly held company and will release third quarter earnings by November 30. For their previously announced results for the 6 months ending June 30, 2012, Chile had strong performance.","Net sales for the 6 months grew 12.9% along with a comp store sales increase of 9.5%. Operating income was down as prior year results were impacted by the gain on the sale of an investment. We also continue to have success with our private brands in Chile, and our leadership team has excelled in incorporating a number of our global private brands into their merchandise mix. Great Value, which was launched 2 years ago in our Chilean stores, now is a well recognized value brand in the country.","Moving to Asia. We're working on a number of areas in China to strengthen the foundation, centralizing our merchandising organization, developing talent and strengthening our compliance organization. We are focused on clearly establishing price leadership by driving simplicity, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. A more disciplined approach to our real estate development and new store growth that we discussed last quarter is moving into place and will put us on a stronger path to have more ideal locations to drive sales, traffic and growth. EDLP is a long-term strategy that we know will work in China.","Walmart China grew sales during the third quarter, but we had a slight decrease in operating income versus the prior year. Net sales for the third quarter grew 6.1% over last year, and the comp sales growth was 0.4%. Average ticket grew 8% in China, but traffic declined 7.6%. The traffic declines in China are not new, and we believe customer shopping frequency has shifted in the market. That said, we have room to improve our performance as our assortment and value offering strengthen.","Gross profit rate was down in the quarter, and operating expenses grew slower than sales. In September, Walmart China was named as one of the Top 100 Most Trustful Brands and won the 2012 Seven-Star Award for outstanding contribution in food safety and public health by global food safety management experts of Ecolab and China Business News.","As Mike mentioned, we successfully closed the transaction to own 51% of Yihaodian last month, which is excellent news for our eCommerce business initiatives in China. This transaction will help us to expand our presence in China. Yihaodian is accelerating growth in grocery and general merchandise sales and we're excited about how we can help them grow.","Turning to Japan. After a strong first half, our business is experiencing additional challenges from the broader macroeconomic environment in the country. Simply, consumer sentiment is weakening. We continue to outperform the market in comp store sales through the strength of EDLP and the price gap that we've created over the last couple of years.","Walmart Japan's net sales and comp sales were down 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively. Third quarter average ticket was down 0.2%, and traffic was down 1.7%. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the third quarter declined by 2.5%, indicating that Walmart continues to outperform the market. Japan had a slight operating loss for the third quarter and, given the tough sales environment, we did not leverage expenses in this market.","Our corporate culture is built on a foundation of acting with integrity and the highest ethical standards. Recently, we made improvements to our compliance programs around the world and have taken a number of actions with respect to our processes, procedures and people. We aligned our corporate structure to have global compliance, ethics, investigations and legal functions under one organization. We also named a Global Chief Compliance Officer and a Chief Compliance Officer for Walmart International. We take compliance with all laws very seriously and we are working hard and dedicating resources to enhance our programs.","The actions I've described are just a few of the things we're doing to make our programs even stronger and more effective where we operate.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. Most of our markets also celebrate Christmas and we're ready to serve customers during this important holiday. As I mentioned, some countries have adopted various versions of Black Friday events to further drive sales and we believe these will strengthen our brands where they're executed.","We'll experience some fourth quarter headwind in China due to a later Chinese New Year. So we're working to make the most of other holidays, including Three Kings, to drive sales as we finish the year. Our plans are in place, and we're excited that the holiday season is finally here.","Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?","Rosalind Gates Brewer","Thanks, Doug. Sam's Club third quarter net sales and operating income continued to grow. Strategic price investments, the membership pilot in Texas and holiday preparation led the focus for the quarter. Seven new clubs opened, the most since the fourth quarter in fiscal year 2006.","Comp sales without fuel were up 2.7% for the 13-week period. This was achieved on top of a very healthy 5.7% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.5%, and ticket was up 1.2%.","Although we are pleased with the positive results, we are disappointed that comp sales were below our guidance. This miss was driven by several factors. The combination of inflation and deflation across multiple categories affected comp sales. Inflation in some categories led members to trade down. Deflation in other categories came faster and deeper late in the quarter with October being the lowest inflation we have seen in some time. Finally, our business members continue to experience economic pressure and uncertainty, which led to slower growth in business member traffic. We anticipate this softening could remain a headwind in the fourth quarter.","This quarter, we accelerated price investments in traffic-driving categories, which led to strong unit growth. Because of timing of these price investments, we expect them to have a greater impact on our fourth quarter margin rate than they did in the third quarter.","In October, we announced the introduction of our new membership benefit and fee pilot program to all Texas clubs, which account for approximately 12% of our club base. The pilot includes a fee increase, our first since 2006 and simplifies our cardholder and fee structure. It also provides instant savings and cash rewards for qualifying purchases.","We are encouraged by the member response thus far in Texas.","I also mentioned we opened 7 new clubs in the third quarter, totaling 9 new clubs this fiscal year. This is the most openings we've had in a single year since fiscal 2009. We opened our first new club in the greater Chicagoland area in 12 years in Elgin, Illinois. Together, all 7 clubs provide almost 1 million additional square feet for Sam's Club.","So let's cover our reported results, which include fuel sales. Net sales were $13.9 billion, a 4.7% increase over last year's third quarter. Fuel prices were up 6% compared to last year and gallons sold were up 7.2%, thus creating a boost to overall sales of 1.1%. Gross profit rate was down 5 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 31 basis points. Operating income increased 12.7% to $435 million.","Now the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business, which excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted. Net sales were $12.2 billion, up 3.6% from last year. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West with our strongest regional performance in the Great Plains, Mid-South and Mid-Atlantic.","Now I'd like to turn your attention to merchandising. There were 3 major themes during the third quarter: price investment, moderation of inflation and new product introduction. In line with our company's core mission, Sam's Club is stepping up investments to drive lower prices and values on key traffic-driving items. One example was rotisserie chicken, which has long been one of the most popular items of our home meal solutions. When there's a rotisserie chicken in the basket, ticket is larger, and we're seeing significant increases in units sold since we lowered the price.","Additionally, we have reduced prices in several varieties of apples, multiple products in beauty and in baby. To help address the specific needs of our business member, we have lowered prices on products critical to them such as condiments, cooking oils and paper products.","Inflation is quickly moderating across the club, and the effect was most pronounced later in the quarter. In last year's third quarter, we estimated retail inflation across the club was approximately 325 to 375 basis points while this year it was only 70 to 100 basis points. This was down significantly also from our second quarter estimates of 175 to 225 basis points.","However, we have seen sharper inflation continue in some categories, most notably in meat. Because price increases for beef are inflating mid-single digits, members are switching to different proteins, particularly pork, which is deflationary. Protein-related trade down has impacted comp sales. Key categories like milk, cheese and eggs are also experiencing deflation, which is a headwind for our top line results. Although units are increasing, the deflation has proven to be challenging to overcome in these categories. Sugar and coffee prices are moderating as well.","Freezer\/cooler comp sales increased in the low single digits. Recent introductions in frozen confections and snacks generate excitement with our members. Fresh sales continue to grow low-single digit comps, with produce leading the way. Grocery and beverage comp sales were up low single digits. With the expiration of the K-Cup patent, Sam's private label version, Daily Chef single-serve cups, has been popular with our members.","In consumables, the baby category is up double-digit comps with improvements in distribution. We are improving the assortment and investing in price for diapers, infant formula and baby wipes. Leveraging our marketing programs and communicating our strong assortment at a great value have been keys to success.","Comp sales in technology and entertainment, which continue to experience deflation, were slightly positive this quarter. Wireless, up double-digit comps, performed well and benefited from both the Samsung Galaxy III and the Apple iPhone 5. Television and home theater comps are up low single digits, driven by unit movement and improved availability in large-screen televisions. Average selling prices continue to decrease for TVs, and our inventory position for the holidays is very good. Video games, music and movies continue to experience pressure in the current environment.","Early availability of toys in our clubs has driven double-digit comp sales. Apparel was up low-single digit comps, and home achieved high-single digit comps. The continued introduction of new national brands and better assortment have driven sales growth.","Recent innovations in mattresses are helping sales as well, and we continue to be a destination for this category.","Health and Wellness remains a growth category, with comps up mid-single digits. Sales of over-the-counter products are benefiting from the introduction of new diet trend products.","E-commerce continues to help members access Sam's Club anywhere, anytime. During the third quarter, traffic was up, and more members are utilizing our e-commerce solutions. Online sales of electronics and baby care are growing.","Membership and other income was up 2.3% for the quarter. Sam's continues to recognize a profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider quarterly. Last year, we recognized this benefit in full at year end. Membership income is up 0.8%, and our renewal rate remains steady.","Gross profit rate increased by 11 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. The rate improvement is due to shifts in merchandise mix. Pharmacy brand-to-generic conversions and shifts away from lower margin categories such as tobacco benefited margin rate. Nonmerchandise-related activities such as supplier funds received for the health and wellness magazine also drove the rate increase.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect that as we step up price investments, there will be a greater impact on our margin rate in the fourth quarter. Our operations team continues to balance expense leverage with improving member service. Driven by in-club efficiencies gained through innovation, we reduced third quarter operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 24 basis points and have seen units per labor hour increase 3.6%.","We completed fewer remodels this quarter, which led to expense reduction. Additionally, we received a credit related to overpayment of state excise taxes in prior years.","Looking at the bottom line, our third quarter operating income increased to $427 million, a 14.2% increase over third quarter last year. We are pleased with this increase but recognize it is driven by both successful initiatives such as better expense leverage, as well as nonoperating benefits that I previously mentioned.","Our members continue to raise their rating of us in the member experience survey, and we continue to benefit from the strong program put in place last year. Members love our self-checkout now in over half of our clubs. In these clubs, approximately 40% of our members have used these quicker lanes. Our new club in Kansas City represents a step change in the way we hope to operate our clubs in the future. This is our first club that will have all registers set to be fully convertible, meaning they can either operate in self-checkout mode or in cashier mode. This is the first test of this concept and will help us understand the member reaction, as well as our ability to manage shrink control and member service.","Inventory increased 10.8% over last year. While we intentionally built inventory for the holiday season, we find this current level of inventory unacceptable to our business model. Because significant portions of this inventory are highly consumable, we feel certain that any exposure is at a minimum.","Similar to Walmart and other retailers, we were impacted by superstorm Sandy. We were able to reopen 37 of our 41 impacted clubs within 24 hours and the remaining within 3 days. I'm proud of our associates and the work they are doing to help our members recover from the destruction left in the wake of the storm.","Looking toward the future, we are excited about the long-term position for the clubs as we add new square footage, invest in price and learn from our membership pilot in Texas. The clubs are well positioned for the fourth quarter, and we announced our Black Friday details last week. Our holiday selling season starts the 2 weeks prior to Thanksgiving with our Holiday Taste of Sam's and an invitation-only event for select members.","However, operating income growth will be challenged in the fourth quarter. Many of the initiatives that will benefit Sam's long term like price investment and the membership pilot will impact operating income in the short term. Additionally, the timing change in recognition of our credit card provider profit-sharing arrangement versus last year along with recent trends of moderating inflation and business member traffic are additional headwinds.","We expect to deliver a club comp sales increase, without fuel, of 1.5% to 3.5% for the 13-week period ending January 25, 2013. Last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.4% for the comparable 13-week period.","Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap-up and guidance. Charles?","Charles M. Holley","Thanks, Roz. We had a very good third quarter, once again highlighting both the value we offer our customers and the discipline we continue to drive in how we operate. Granted, the economies where we currently operate are still challenging, but our ability to drive productivity and Every Day Low Costs allow us to generate good returns in our businesses.","Gross leverage and returns remain our consistent financial priorities. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide flexibility to invest in both growth opportunities and new initiatives like eCommerce. We remain steadfast in our drive to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points over the next 5 years. We'll do this by reducing costs and improving productivity to invest in lower prices in Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club and to achieve greater profitability in Walmart International. And last, of course, we strive to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.","Let's start with the details on growth. In the third quarter, we added approximately $3.7 billion in net sales. This growth includes a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1.7 billion. On a constant currency basis, our net sales growth would have approached $5.5 billion. Part of that growth came from the nearly 13 million retail square feet that we added for the quarter. Your takeaway should be that despite softness in the global economy, Walmart is still delivering very meaningful growth from a combination of stores and eCommerce.","Year-to-date, net sales of $339 billion were 5.4% above last year. We remain on track to deliver consolidated net sales growth of around 5% for the full year. Remember, this includes a negative impact of approximately $5.2 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations. We will grow through a variety of formats in all of our markets. And as you heard me say at our October Analyst Meeting, our capital forecast is between $12.6 billion and $13.5 billion for the current fiscal year.","Now let's turn to leverage. We have now levered our expenses for over 2 consecutive years and we aren't done. We fully expect to lever expenses in the fourth quarter despite headwinds from growth and Global eCommerce initiatives, expenses related to FCPA matters and increased spending associated with our leverage activities.","In fact, let me highlight some of the examples that Rollin Ford and his team are having success with. We are driving significant savings in goods not for resale by leveraging our global buys across the markets. We are increasing the volume of direct imports across markets, lowering our cost of goods sold and enhancing the quality of many products on our shelves. And we are standardizing a global replenishment system and improving inventory flow across our international markets.","Let's move on to returns. Operating income grew 4% in the third quarter, which outpaced sales growth. This led to operating cash flow of nearly $16 billion. And earnings per share increased 11.3% over last year. The combination of our strong operating cash flow and our disciplined capital allocation resulted in about $7 billion of free cash flow at the end of the quarter, a $3.6 billion improvement versus the same period last year. The strength of our free cash flow allows us to continue to provide good returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2012, was 18% compared to 18.2% from last year and continues to be one of the highest in retail. As Jeff mentioned earlier, on a constant currency basis, the improvement in ROI driven by capital discipline was offset by currency rate fluctuations.","Now let's talk about guidance. As I mentioned, we expect to finish the year with net sales growth of around 5%, which is about $20 billion on our sales base. Bill and Roz outlined their 13-week comp sales estimates for the fourth quarter, 1% to 3% for Walmart U.S. and 1.5% to 3.5% for Sam's Club.","While we are optimistic about sales, we are also realistic. Current macroeconomic conditions continue to pressure our customers. The holiday season is predicted to be very competitive, but we are very well prepared to deliver on the value and low prices our customers expect. In fact, both Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club are ready with excellent plans. And in our key international markets, holiday planning is expected to drive sales growth as well.","When providing quarterly guidance, we normally consider a number of factors, including the macroeconomic environment and the competitive landscape. We expect currency exchange rates to remain at the current levels and our full year effective tax rate to be at the low end of our range between 32.5% and 33.5%. Our investments in Global eCommerce and global leverage services along with the FCPA-related expenses will continue to be headwinds.","Based on these considerations, we expect fourth quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings per share to range between $1.53 and $1.58, which compares to $1.51 reported last year. However, let me remind you that last year, fourth quarter earnings per share benefited by $0.07 from certain items. Net of these items, the underlying comparison should be made to $1.44.","For the full year, we are tightening our earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $4.88 to $4.93. This compares to our previous guidance of $4.83 to $4.93 and last year's earnings per share of $4.54.","Our company delivers consistent strong financial results. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to invest in innovation and growth initiatives that will lay groundwork for an even brighter future.","Thank you for listening today and for your interest in our company. We hope you have a great holiday."],"21863":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Raymond James 37th Annual Institutional Investors Conference March  8, 2016  1:05 PM ET","Executives","Brett Biggs - Chief Financial Officer","Steve Bratspies - Chief Merchandising Officer","Analysts","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Operator","Good afternoon, I\u2019m Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. It\u2019s my privilege and pleasure to welcome you this afternoon to the Wal-Mart presentation at our 37th Annual Investor Institutional Investors Conference. I trust everybody had a good lunch. With us today from Wal-Mart we are very pleased to have Brett Biggs, Chief Financial Officer of the Company. And giving the presentation today, we have Steve Bratspies, who was recently named the Chief Merchandising Officer of the Company. Without any further ado, Steve, floor is yours.","Steve Bratspies","Thanks, Budd. Good afternoon everybody. As Budd mentioned, I have been Chief Merchandising Officer just a short period of time, almost five months now in the company, but I\u2019ve been with Wal-Mart for about a decade. So I\u2019ve done a lot of different things to the company, marketing and merchandising and now have the honor to lead a great merchandising team at Wal-Mart U.S. I am very proud of.","We got a great, strong leadership team really good plan that we are very focused on delivering and while I am going to spend a little bit of time with you today is to see a top line of what that plan is on what we are focused on, but more importantly how we are going to merchandise. I\u2019m going to dive down and talk to you about what I\u2019m focused on, what my team is focused on to help deliver the U.S. plan.","Start, I always have to put the forward-looking statements, disclaimer up you guys all know this, it better than I do, but I thought put it up there just so I\u2019ll cover it. Any questions you can see it at our website as we go forward.","So let me talk to you about growth. And I want to start by taking a quick step back, quick look back at the release that we just made. We just made our Q4 release couple of weeks ago, and comp sales for the U.S. were positive for the sixth consecutive quarter at 60 basis points driven by the fifth consecutive quarter of positive traffic growth in the stores.","Neighborhood markets delivered nearly 7 comps during that time. And as you know we\u2019ve been investing heavily in our business, heavily in our people, in the talent and technology and its\u2019 really starting to pay off for us as we could see improving customer experience scores across the U.S. business.","Globally, commerce sales were at 8% for the fourth quarter and 12% for the year last year on a constant currency basis. We expanded our online grocery business to 22 markets and we\u2019ll do about another 20 markets this year as we continue to invest in that business and continue to find the intersection of physical and digital. We are getting great responses from our customer on this for satisfaction scores already in the mid-90s. So we feel good about where we are going on that.","So, lots of progress that we feel good about, but we know we got a lot of work to do, and we are very focused on delivering in the future for our customers and for our shareholders. And for us to do that it really all begins with our customer. I am going to spend a little bit of time talking about the customer today, a little bit of a deeper dive understanding at some of the things that we are learning as we go forward.","The customer today is changing dramatically. Who they are, what they want, how they shop, where they shop, when they shop, lots of different changes that are going on all at one time. 79 million of them are millennials, and what\u2019s great is they are moving into prime spending years, right. They started a little slower in household formation, they are moving faster and are in that time right now.","48% of them are multi cultural, versus 285 from the boomers, which is a dramatic shift and dramatic change in the business. They are the most value driven generation that was seen in my life time, slightly ahead of Gen X but they are very, very focused to value to lines for Wal-Mart. And they also had a strong infinity for Wal-Mart than any of the generations.","66% of millennials have shopped at Wal-Mart store in the past month. And they are more likely than the total population to shop Wal-Mart store. So it\u2019s a very important customer to us, the one that aligns very well with our business. Busy customers that demand a new level of convenience, new expectations, really what they want is, they want to see more shopping experience. They want to shop Wal-Mart, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s online, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s mobile, they don\u2019t care if it\u2019s in the store, they want it to be a seamless shopping experience for them and that\u2019s what we are working on delivering.","We are seeing some good results. We continue to capture more than our fair share of millennial customer spending with especially those millennials that have kids already. We increased our market share with millennial mass by 450 basis points over the last few years and a lot of people ask why are we doing that, what\u2019s working.","Fundamentally it\u2019s because we have the products that they want. They like our grocery, they like our babies assortment which is obviously very important for them at the stage or life that they are in right now. Convenient locations, they definitely subscribe to the one stop shopping, again you are talking young families, household formations, one stop shopping is a huge convenience to them and ultimately our low price model and budget approach to shopping works very well for them, is very value conscious.","Our best shoppers are the ones who shop with us not only in stores, but they shop online. And if you think about that intersection of physical and digital, we talk a lot about as a company, plays out in how customer spend. They spend more; they shop more frequently when they shop all channels, so just some numbers for you.","Wal-Mart store only customer spends on average about $1,400 a year. An online customer only spend a couple of hundred dollars. The customer who shops both, online and in the store spend about $2,500 with us on average in a year. So that customer is in the middle of the intersection of those two circles is incredibly valuable for us and as they continue to build that behavior we are going to continue to take advantage of it.","So let me take a minute and give you high level Wal-Mart in U.S. strategy and this is nothing new. You heard this from us before, Greg Foran, my boss has talked about this, but I thought I would set the context quickly for what we are trying to do. And ultimately that\u2019s delivered a seamless shopping experience of the scale. We think we are well positioned to do that in a way that no one else has been able to do that so far.","And there is four key planks to enable us to do that. Number one, winning new stores and it\u2019s all about what we are doing to provide an excellent experience for our customers who are there. We made a lot of investments in that area and people and the technology but make our stores fundamentally run better.","The second is delivering value. Low price has always been our key differentiator in the market and we are going to continue as we invest to grow, we are going to continue to invest in pricing. We are not going to comprise on any quality or any products as we do that, so pricing quality investments are going to be very important to us going forward.","The third one which is near and dear to my heart being great merchants. We\u2019ve got to run great stores and we\u2019ve got to have great product in that stores. And as merchants we have to think through how the product flows into the store, how it flows through the shelf, all the way up to the register, making that as seamless as possible for our stores so they can operate better. It\u2019s about great product, executing great programs in our stores, seasonal programs and bringing to life great brands.","And finally, it\u2019s about providing convenience. We really believe that we are uniquely positioned with the footprint that we have on a physical basis to add the digital to that and provide a few more shopping experience for merchandise across all channels as we go forward.","So that\u2019s the U.S. strategy, let me talk to you about merchandising. Let me talk to you about what I am focused on, what my team is focused on every single day to make our business better. And it\u2019s three things. Its\u2019 customer advocacy, it\u2019s continuing to improve our cost position and its service to our stores. Let me touch on each one of this in a minute.","Customer advocacy, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, but it really just needs to be obsessed with customers. It\u2019s putting the customer at the centre of every single thing that we do, and creating experience with them that\u2019s valuable, fun, exciting and basically worth their time, that\u2019s what we have to do. We have to keep focusing on them all the time.","Our cost position, this company is built on a promise in a purpose to save money, live better, it always has been and it always will be. It\u2019s what we are known for and it\u2019s what we stand for and we are going to consistently guard that position in the market place and make investments overtime to make sure that we provide the absolute best value for our customers and to do that we have to run a strong EDLC model. We have to continue to take costs out of our business to be able to invest in price as we go forward.","And finally, service to our stores. If you are a merchant at Wal-Mart, you serve two bosses. You serve the customer number one, and number two you serve the stores. And your job is to help the stores run more efficient, how do they improve their efficiencies once again so we can take cost out so we can continue to invest in our business. We have a lot of aggressive plans around, order fill rates, greater efficiency at the shelf; improve speed, and creating a lot more customized programs at the local level to drive our business.","What I want to talk to you mostly today is about the first one, which is customer advocacy. And what do we do to drive royalty, to create a better customer experience and ultimately to earn the trust of our customers so that they can see to come back time and time again.","So the first piece of customer advocacy is where we need to start is with our fresh business. Why do we start with Fresh? Because we walked into Wal-Mart so what\u2019s the first thing you see? You see Fresh. It sets the tone for the experience of your entire shopping trip with Wal-Mart. It\u2019s a huge priority for us, because it\u2019s a big traffic driver and it\u2019s very important to our customers. And we know when we get fresh right, the entire box benefits from that business as we go forward and we\u2019ve got really comprehensive plans, we called all the way from farm to fork. So what do I mean by that?","We are looking at how source product, where we source it from globally, how we change seasons more effectively, all the way to fork. It\u2019s not just about having fresh products in our store; it needs to be fresh when you take it home. When you experience it, two, three days later out of your refrigerator, it needs to still be fresh product, how do we extend that overtime. And that\u2019s ultimately our focus.","People often ask so what\u2019s different, when am I going to see your stores. When you go into our stores this year, I think you are going to see a couple of things. One, you are going to see better assortment, improved quality, better presentation of products. The wet wall in our produce area is different, it\u2019s been flipped, we are going to lead off with fresh both vegetables, the set of fresher tone right on atonality, and we\u2019ve expanded space for cut through which is a huge growth business for us. We\u2019ve changed our assortment mix between bag and both [ph] products all to make sure the assortment is better for the customer.","The shopping experience is going to be different. We are rolling out a project that we call Fresh Angle rollout. And what is as we walk into a frozen department, we are reorienting all the fixturing in there and lowering the profiles. So you are going to be able to come here, you are going to have more space, you are going to have more sideline, able to see the wet walls, see the valley, easier to shop, it\u2019s going to change dramatically the looking field of our produce department. We have it in a 180 stores right now; it will be in about 3,300 by the end of the year, so a pretty big rollout for us.","And also, much better in store execution. We\u2019ve made a lot of investment in wages as you all know about and the department managers back we are also adding in we called Fresh Operations Manager at the market level to have an expert in every single market to teach, train and build capabilities in the stores on an ongoing basis.","And ultimately as I talked about earlier, better freshness. Freshness is the key at how you actually judge the product. We\u2019ve taken a full day at inventory out of our supply chain over the last few years to make sure that we continue to provide that fresher experience.","So we\u2019re optimistic about our growth in this area and we are always seeing some great results. 52-week produce market share up 44 basis points, organic market share up 80 basis points in the last 52 weeks. So, the customer is responding to what we are doing. We expect these investments to pay off in the short term and the long term and we are pretty confident about what we are doing and the customer perception improvement that we are seeing across the department is the best measure to tell us that we are working on the right things.","Second area, how do we build relationships and trust customers private brands. We\u2019ve always had a big private brand business across Wal-Mart and it\u2019s across the entire business. GM, Softline, food consumables, but customers are asking more and more from more private brands. It\u2019s a key loyalty driver and those customers who buy it, who are -- participate in private brands they make more trips and they spend more. And where they commonly make those incremental trips 50% of what they spend is on branded products. So we know what they doing, its building a more engaged relationship and it\u2019s a deeper penetration of how they shop at Wal-Mart and why they shop Wal-Mart.","The penetration of brand, the private brand is increasing both in skew count and in new items. So, the density of that in our stores is going to continue to increase. We believe winning with private brands come down to three things, its price innovation and quality and we are spending a lot of effort to invest in product development, sourcing technology, new talent to be able to build this business.","For those of you who visit us in Bentonville, and while I encourage you to come see us, we are building a best-in-class product development and sensory lab right in Bentonville right at our home office that will have opened in just a couple of months, which will give us whole new level of capability for us to build as we go forward.","Now one of the question I get asked a lot of time I thought our private brands is when you are always have to say you are house of brands. And so what does that mean, how do you think about that? And what I would tell you is we always have been a house of brands, and we always will be house of brands. National brands are incredibly important to us, number one because our customers want them. Number two, it\u2019s a fundamental part of the EDLP program. We show price value by customers comparing national brands to one another. So none of that is changing as we do this, but it\u2019s going to be a balance of both as we go forward.","The next business that really is growing and becoming a more and more important part of our business is our Health and Wellness area. Everybody knows that healthcare always ranks among the top concern of the entire population let alone just our customers. And in boomers age more and more of this is going to become a bigger and bigger issue for the society. And that\u2019s why we are continuing to invest and expand our portfolio here to serve customers better and then for us it\u2019s all about access and affordability in this area.","Today we operate 4,500 pharmacies, 2,900 vision centers all demonstrating strong growth across the business. We worked and really how do we engage these customers even further. This is an area where health and wellness its\u2019 all about trust. When you look at the customer, I have to trust you in my health and wellness business and the best measure I have to show trust is our immunizations business has doubled in the last year. So to me there is nothing it says trust more than I\u2019m going to let you stick a needle in me in the middle of a store.","So we feel pretty good about that as a good leading indicator and that customers trust us more and more as we go forward. Just to give you one example of something that we are doing in this business area, it\u2019s called the America\u2019s biggest health fair and we did it the first time in October, where in a four day period we delivered 50,000 immunizations, 280,000 health screenings and we distributed almost 200 million healthy product samples. And we look at those numbers and say wow, that\u2019s great the scale of our ability to do this.","But what\u2019s really powerful about this is we\u2019re going to take it down to an individual customer and we got dozens and dozens of stories coming out of this health fair and just one that I\u2019ll share with you.","There is a woman in one of our stores in Atlanta who came in, had a blood pressure screening. And the store immediately called 911. They took this woman to the hospital; her blood pressure was 255\/160. And she was about to have a stroke or heart attack and the doctors and her family contacted the store afterwards and said she was going to have a major medical event within a few hours if she had not been in a Wal-Mart store at this healthcare and gotten her blood pressure checked.","So it\u2019s just one example. Again, the numbers are big but we like to take it all the way down to an individual customers and pretty powerful stuff that we can do for our customers to help them on the Live Better part of our promise.","Convenience. How do we improve customer experience? How do we think about shopping in the future and how do we change our business as we go forward? Nearly, 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of Wal-Mart store. So, we have access basically to the entire U.S. population just based on our current layout and our stores. So, we are going to continue to provide more access and more conveyance to those customers in three key ways.","The first is with pickup. And we are really making some good meaningful progress here. Customers keep telling us how much they liked it. This is when a customer goes online, orders an item and he comes in a store and then pick it up for free, often within the same day. It\u2019s been a real priority for us over the last year. The business spiked dramatically during the holiday time, lots of huge volume. That volume has continued on. Customers are excited about it. It provides instant easier access to the great assortment that we have in our store without them having to go do a lot of work.","Second piece, online grocery. I mentioned it earlier but customers love the ability to shop online, order the groceries and come to a store and never even get out of their car. Open their trunk, we will put the groceries in their trunk for them and move right on. These customers represent a larger basket and many of them are new incremental customers to Wal-Mart. And as I said earlier, customer satisfaction is in the 90s of this business. Customers really like it. We\u2019ve expanded it to over 20 markets already and we will do another 20 markets as we rollout this year and continue to build this business.","And the final piece is Wal-Mart App. And it\u2019s one of the top three apps in retail. We\u2019ve got tens of millions of customers who use it and it\u2019s all about continuing to add new tools, new capabilities to the app. It\u2019s pretty helpful today if you want to go shop a supercenter to find the product and the aisle locator where you want that product. But recently, we added to it and we introduced Wal-Mart Pay, which is an example of how this app gives customers a seamless experience between digital and physical.","It just takes the digital world and brings it to the store and makes the store that much more convenient that much simpler. It\u2019s a really, really cool application. It\u2019s unbelievably simple and we will be rolling that out through the rest of the country through the first half of this year. I really believe in this area going back to that 90% within 10 miles, we can do what nobody else can really do effectively on a big scale and that\u2019s marry e-commerce with a physical location and that\u2019s what we are really focused on rolling out over the next couple years.","Everything I just said is always powered and anchored in what you know from us, which is we are going to be running EDLP business and we are going to power it by EDLC. We are going to deliver that consistent stable pricing that builds trust with our customers. That\u2019s why they come back to us because they trust the price that they are getting from us every single day. To do that and do that really well, we have to continue to improve our low cost position. We are doing a lot of work to drive costs out of our system across the entire franchise.","A few things we are doing specifically that we focused on is taking all, most of the co-op marketing out of our business and encouraging our supplier partners to put that into the cost of goods, reducing the number of tabs that we have in the marketplace. We had over a 100 few years ago. We will be down under 20, as we go forward.","We are working to get to more consistent terms and allowances to take costs out of the business, operating with our suppliers and looking at every single aspect of our business from sourcing to logistics, to technology. How do we continue to improve our cost position? So, ultimately, we can deliver on our EDL promise to our customers and not compromise on quality.","So, as a merchant, I couldn\u2019t stand here today and not talk to you about items because we know -- Budd, we talked about earlier. We are an item driven business. We\u2019ve always been and we will always going to continue to be. So, I want to share just a couple items with you that are examples of great EDLPs that you can find in our store right now. So last year -- I\u2019m grabbing some products.","Last year, we sold a $1.68 Cami in our store, sold millions of items and it\u2019s this program called Shocking Value that we have in our apparel business. We are following that up this year with a $2.87 No Boundaries T-Shirt. When we will have done, I would encourage you come up, feel the quality and touch this product. This is incredible quality product for $2.87. You are going to see masked out tables in our stores, great arrangement of colors, really, really looks good.","We are also going to give lot of fun this summer with a product called Bubble Wands. We are going to sell a six pack of Bubble Wands for $3.88. We say okay that sounds good. We are going to sell 6 million of them. Last year, this product was $4.97 and we sold a million of them. This year we are going to sell 6 million to $3.88. And how we are going to do that? One, rollback of the price, but you are going to see masked displays right in front of the customers. It\u2019s a great item that we will have a lot of fun with.","And the last one is great seasonal item which is Peeps. As we head into Easter time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all had Peeps and I\u2019m sure you all love the taste of Peeps. Well, we are going to sell them at $1 this year, which will be a 20%, 25% value to anyone in the market and we also have what we call Mystery Peeps. There is three mystery flavors this year. So, I would encourage you to go try it, only at Wal-Mart and we will reveal them at the week of Easter. But just examples of fun exciting items at great prices that make a difference in our business.","So, as we work on building the fresh business, as we work on building a global e-commerce business, the one thing we are never going to forget and we are never going to walk away from this Wal-Mart is great item merchandising at EDLP pricing because that\u2019s what drives our business and that\u2019s what our customers love when they come to see us.","So let me just wrap up my time with you and just kind of leave you with a couple thoughts. One, I think we\u2019ve got a really clearly defined strategy in the U.S. It\u2019s about winning with stores. It\u2019s about delivering value, being great merchants and then providing convenience to our customers. My team\u2019s role, merchandising\u2019s focus is about executing that strategy and what are we focused on. We are going to be focused on the customer. We are going to put the customer at the centre of everything that we do. We are very focused on improving our cost positions so we can invest in price over time and make sure that we serve stores as effectively as we possibly can. I think we are on the right path. Traffic, comps, satisfaction with the customer all improving and we are working on the right things and we are encouraged about our progress so far.","So, thank you for your time. And I guess we will probably do some questions.","Budd Bugatch","We have some time for questions. Let\u2019s start. Let\u2019s deal with some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Unidentified Analyst","As you continue to grow the health and wellness franchise and look to strengthen your cost position, there are examples in the market of deals directly between for instance pharma companies and pharmacies like the Walgreens, Valeant deal. As you evaluate your relationships with the wholesalers like an AmerisourceBergen or McKesson, can you just talk about how you view those relationships versus going directly to large pharma companies given your scale?","Steve Bratspies","Yes. Thanks for question. I would say very important relationships to us and there has been a lot of change in the marketplace over the last couple years, different mergers, different programs going on. We are always looking at options to figure out what\u2019s the best way to run our business. It\u2019s a business that we are going to continue to invest in. It\u2019s incredibly important to us and to our customers. So, we are going to always evaluate what\u2019s the best way for us to do that. But those relationships that brought us this far in this business are very important to us and we are going to build upon it.","Budd Bugatch","Questions? I will ask one. Several years ago at this conference, Bill Simon made a really good case about the outsized market share that Wal-Mart had at the weekly shop and part of the impetus of the Neighborhood Market and the Wal-Mart Express test was to develop a better market share of the midweek shop. Can you give us kind of an update on where we are on that process and what the current thinking is of the leadership?","Steve Bratspies","Yes. Sure. Thanks, Budd. Yes, worth looking at is when you run a business a size that we run we need to participate in every shopping trip that exists out there. And one of the reasons we continue to lean into invest in the Neighborhood Market franchise is it serves that need really, really well. It\u2019s our convenience format, which customers like to do, the smaller shopping trip to as they go forward.","We build 85 to 95 more of them this year than we have going forward. So, we are going to continue to invest. We are working all the programs that I talked about today apply to Neighborhood Markets as well. Improving our fresh business there, making them more convenient. We continue to lead and to pick-up in those stores to make them more productive as we go forward. But that midweek shopping trip continues to be a big part how customers are shopping and changing their behavior and we are using the Neighborhood Market particularly to go after that.","Budd Bugatch","And you have been redoing Neighborhood Markets to get that. How does that feel and where are you now in that innovation? You\u2019ve made a couple of new Neighborhood Markets near the Home Office that have had some different items. Where are we on that?","Steve Bratspies","We have. There is a couple of different protos that we are working on in our local area, in the Home Office. Couple things. We are changing the fresh layout in those stores. Lowering profiles, creating more shopping space, adding to the assortment there in fresh, building out our daily business and adding more capabilities, things like new pizza programs and things like that in those businesses, making those stores convenient by splitting the aisles.","A lot of times you go into Wal-Mart, one of the complaints customer has a long runs. So in Neighborhood Markets and the new protos they are split aisles, which creates more opportunity for us. We are expanding the baby department in Neighborhood Market in stores that it makes sense, all to serve that customer better over time, so just a few examples of things that we are working on.","Unidentified Analyst","Sometimes ago, I have read a story that you are closing down shops in let\u2019s say rural areas because the population was not big enough. You plan to address that issue with let\u2019s say Drop-off stations or something like that to give them at least a chance to buy something.","Steve Bratspies","Yes. Let me just start with these closing stores. We did close about 150 stores at the end of last year, which was really part of a very large comprehensive global portfolio review, as to where we are in terms of what are the best assets that we have, how do we optimize them and where do we want to invest and where do we not want to invest.","The total closures of that business was less than 1% of our total square footage on a global basis, so not a tremendous amount. But all of those stores from the U.S. were our Express stores and many of those were located in some rural areas. That Express store pilot that we ran, it was a 105 stores, I think is the exact number.","Basically, we decided that it didn\u2019t fit the model of operating that we wanted to have in the future. Many of those locations, we actually wish we had build the Neighborhood Market in quite frankly. So, as we\u2019ve gotten more encouraged with our Neighborhood Market results, we don\u2019t think or we know that the Express business doesn\u2019t fit into our model as we go forward.","In terms of reaching more rural area, that\u2019s a real estate kind of analysis play that we will always do. We are always looking for new markets. We are going to continue to build the stores. We are just not going to build Express stores in those markets that we\u2019ve build. We are going to build the Supercenter. We are going to build the Neighborhood Market.","Unidentified Analyst","So the company\u2019s unilateral decision to raise wages, which has increased your U.S. cost structure by $2.7 billion, doesn\u2019t that really inhibit your ability to invest in price and thus driving any kind of comp going forward?","Steve Bratspies","So the $2.7 billion is an investment that we made for a couple different reasons. One, we need to invest in our associates and our stores, which has always been a strong plank for Wal-Mart in the U.S. and around the globe. So, we wanted to invest in them. Part of that investment is also adding labor to the stores or adding department managers, adding technology, adding capabilities to serve customers much better in our stores.","So, $2.7 billion, that\u2019s not a small number, right. We made a big investment, which obviously you saw what it did to how we position ourselves from an earnings perspective. But what we think that\u2019s going to do is position us for the long-term to grow our comp sales business as we continue to invest and make the experience in our stores better.","Now for price, I talked about what we are trying to do on costs, continuing to take costs out of the system. This year, we are going to start to invest in price again as a business and you are going to see a multi-billion dollar investment over the next couple years. The approach that we basically took was and I think Doug and Greg have used this phrase before. You can\u2019t invite people over your house for dinner before you clean up the house and that\u2019s what we needed to do. And we didn\u2019t think spending a lot of money on price before we improved the performance of our stores, before we improved the experience would be a prudent investment.","Now that we are getting to the point, we feel better about how our stores are being run, how they are being operated, the customer experience in there we are ready to start spending money against price. Our fast, clean and friendly scores, which is how we ultimately kind of measure the metrics of our operators right now, we put a very high bar in place for them last year. 76% of the stores reached that bar and then we flip the calendar and then we raise the bar again and then working back up to climbing that leader to have better fast scores, better cleanliness scores and more convenient stores for our customers. Once we have that, we are going to continue to invest in price.","Budd Bugatch","Just piggybacking on your last comment, one of the big issues has been the back rooms, cleaning up the back rooms, taking inventory out of that.","Steve Bratspies","Yes.","Budd Bugatch","I think that's been a big push of Greg's because he believes if the back rooms are really well organized then the shrink goes down. Shrink was an issue that I think hit us at one of the quarters last year. Where are we in that process? Are all the back rooms clean like you want them?","Steve Bratspies","Sure. No, they are not all clean the way I want them but we are making good progress. And there is lot and there is couple different things happening there. One, clean back room is two things. It\u2019s how you flow product into the store and then ultimately, what are the back room processes you run and the floor processes you run to get it out, so a lot of changes going on in flow. But what I will talk about is in the store. We have a new process that we call CAP. We are rolling out top stock, which is you could see top shelves above where we can put product. Our buyers, some of them I have here with me today are working on pack and a half compliance in our stores, so more product fits on the shelf.","So our back rooms are, I would say significantly better and I have been in some back rooms that are almost completely clean at this point. But not every back room across the franchise is that way. We are making meaningful progress but more work to do but I\u2019m encouraged. Ultimately, when we run a clean back room, what it really means is we are better in stock and our in-stock is better. And when our in-stock is better, we sell more, comps improve. So, we are very focused ultimately on in-stock for the customers and we run a tight efficient backroom process, it allows us to stay in stock on the floor.","Budd Bugatch","Thank you very much. We will continue with the breakout."],"21866":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call November 17, 2016  7:00 AM ET","Executives","Steve Schmitt - VP, IR","Doug McMillon - President and CEO","Brett Biggs - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Steve Schmitt","Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Walmart's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 results. This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is November 17, 2016. On today's call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO, and Brett Biggs, CFO.","This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.","As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our recently published fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investors portion of our corporate Web-site, stock.walmart.com. For fiscal year 2017, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q3 reporting period ran from Saturday, July 30th through Friday, October 28th of this year.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon.","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. As you saw in our earnings release this morning, we delivered another solid quarter and are pleased with the continued momentum in the business. Our associates are doing a good job and it's much appreciated. I'll discuss the details in a minute but I'd like to start by thanking everyone who came to Bentonville for our Investment Community Meeting in October. We enjoyed giving you an update on our plans going forward.","We have a strong Company. We're executing well in our stores and making strategic investments in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We're gaining traction and moving faster to better serve our customers every day. When we were together last month, I outlined four priorities, make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, be the most trusted retailer, and deliver results and position the Company to win. By executing on these priorities, the customer and our shareholders will benefit.","To start, I'd like to highlight some recent developments in e-commerce that demonstrate how we're moving faster and making every day easier for busy families. First, we're excited to see Walmart.com gaining traction. From a marketplace perspective, we're scaling fast, adding 8 million SKUs over the last three months alone. E-commerce contributed 50 basis points to our Q3 Walmart U.S. comp, which is our largest contribution yet. It's great to see an improving e-commerce business complement the momentum we have in our stores.","Next, we recently completed the acquisition of Jet.com and we're excited to have Marc Lore as a member of our leadership team driving U.S. eCommerce for Walmart and Jet.com. One of the reasons Jet.com makes sense for Walmart is the common ground we share with basket economics. Walmart's advantage has always been in providing the lowest prices on a basket of goods, and Jet has created a unique way to deliver the lowest cost basket online. When customers build a bigger basket online, the economics work in their favor and in ours.","Marc has hit the ground running since the acquisition was finalized. We immediately set up teams to accelerate our integration efforts and we're working hard to leverage our strengths, such as optimizing our combined fulfillment networks, utilizing our scale in areas like shipping, sharing our assortment and leveraging the strengths of our marketing teams. We're excited to reap the benefits of our combined businesses and we look forward to updating you on our progress going forward.","I'm also excited by how we've positioned our business in China to win. We continue to be pleased with how our alliance with JD.com allows us to reach even more customers with our brands. We recently announced we own roughly 10% of JD.com's shares and during my visit a few weeks ago we jointly launched two new services.","Our Sam's Club flagship store launched on JD's Web-site, providing hundreds of millions of customers access to Sam's Club's premium products with JD's same-day and next-day delivery service. We also announced an exclusive Walmart Global imports store on JD.com Worldwide, the company's cross-border platform. The new store provides Chinese consumers access to Walmart's selection of thousands of products imported from Walmart stores around the world.","We're working together with them to create a seamless shopping experience. I was able to visit the JD Home Office when I was in China last month and it was clear that they work with speed and the spirit of innovation is strong. When I was in one of our Walmart hypermarkets in Beijing, JD already had a site set up for picking and delivering customer orders.","We also announced an investment in New Dada, China's largest local on-demand logistics and grocery online-to-offline, or O2O, seamless e-commerce platform. Already, New Dada is enabling two-hour delivery service from more than 45 Walmart locations. It's amazing to see how O2O is changing how Chinese consumers shop. Densely populated cities and favorable delivery economics enable two-hour delivery and we look to expand the number of locations using New Dada for two-hour delivery going forward. We're moving faster to position the Company to win, and we're doing this from a position of increasing strength.","Now, I'd like to move to our third quarter results, where we delivered another solid quarter with earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding the $2.1 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $120.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year.","Comp store sales grew 1.2% in Walmart U.S., driven by a traffic increase of 0.7%. Greg Foran, our U.S. leadership team and our associates continue to execute our plan to win, and it's working. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to improve and the team did a great job of managing the flow of inventory again this quarter. Comp store inventory was down approximately 6% and in-stock levels are up.","We also continued to show progress in e-commerce. On a constant currency basis, global e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively. The U.S. results were stronger than those in our key international markets, driven by our marketplace offering, as I mentioned earlier, as well as a contribution from Jet.com. We continue to roll out online grocery and grow our pickup business in stores and clubs. We're making progress giving our customers the seamless shopping experience they are looking for.","Dave Cheesewright and the International team delivered another solid performance in the quarter, growing sales in constant currency 2.4%. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those grew comp sales by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way and I'm pleased with the fact that our momentum is broad-based across formats and countries within Walmex.","I'm pleased comp sales growth returned to positive territory in China. We continue to grow our base of stores and clubs, in addition to the e-commerce initiatives I mentioned earlier. When I was in China, and in conjunction with the Walmart Foundation, we were proud to launch the Walmart Food Safety and Collaboration Center in Beijing with an investment of $25 million from the Company and our foundation.","The goal of the center is to develop solutions to food safety that can be implemented across the global supply chain, so Chinese consumers can trust that the food they eat is safe and good for their families. China is clearly a strategic market for us as it represents the largest retail growth opportunity globally and we're moving with speed to position the business for success.","In the U.K., we're making some progress but our turnaround will take time. We're confident in our leadership team there and want to assure you we continue to address this market with urgency.","We have a strong international business and are encouraged by our positive momentum. As we mentioned in October, we are shaping our portfolio and will make appropriate adjustments if it strengthens the Company. You've seen examples of this recently in Chile and Mexico and we'll continue to evaluate and adjust, when it's best.","At Sam's Club, Roz and the team grew comp sales, excluding fuel, 1.4% and launched Scan & Go nationwide. Scan & Go is a mobile checkout and payment solution, which lets members skip the checkout line. We're pleased with the adoption of this service and we're excited about how it will improve our members' experience, making it easy to shop and save time. Whether it's transforming the way members shop or elevating the experience with exciting new merchandise, the initiatives we have underway position us to win.","Overall, we're gearing up for the holidays, our busiest time of the year, and we'll be ready with great items at low prices to delight our customers. Here in the U.S., we'll have an expanded assortment online and available for pickup, in addition to holiday helpers in stores to help speed customers through the checkout line.","Finally, one of the goals we laid out for you in October was to be the most trusted retailer. Part of building that trust is not only helping customers save money and time but helping them feel good about shopping at Walmart. We want them to be able to trust that the products they buy are good for their families, the planet and the people that made them. So, earlier this month we shared some new targets in sustainability, food and responsible sourcing. We set new goals in the areas of waste, renewable energy and sustainable products including food. Please check out our Web-site to learn more.","Customers have more transparency than ever before when they shop and they expect us to lead in these areas, but they will also expect us to earn their trust and we will. We're excited about this work and are committed to lead in what we believe is a new era of trust and transparency in retail.","In summary, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making across our business. We have momentum and we're moving faster. We have a plan to win, we're executing against it and customers are responding favorably. Now, I'll turn it over to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. Last month at our Investment Community Meeting, we updated investors on how we're transforming the Company from a position of strength. I laid out the financial framework that will guide our decisions, focused on delivering strong efficient growth, operating with discipline, and strategic capital allocation. Growth going forward will focus more on comp sales and we're investing to accelerate e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. with our acquisition of Jet.com and further scaling Walmart.com. We're moving with speed to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Let's turn to our third quarter results. We're pleased that results were in line with our expectations and showed continuing momentum in the business. Excluding currency impacts, each business segment delivered solid net sales growth, and e-commerce GMV and sales growth continued to accelerate. Keep in mind that the results included the operating impact of Jet.com for roughly half of the quarter as well as the transaction costs, both of which were initially forecast to be in the fourth quarter.","Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.1 billion currency impact, increased 2.5% to $120.3 billion. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.7% to $118.2 billion. During the quarter, we added $2.7 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis, which brings year-to-date constant currency growth to nearly $10 billion.","Walmart U.S. continued its solid top line performance, and it's clear that our focus on driving value and a better store experience is resonating with customers. International delivered another solid quarter with Walmex once again leading the way. Sam's Club comp sales were better than expected and membership income again showed steady improvement.","Third quarter EPS was $0.98 versus guidance of $0.90 to $1. There were a few items that impacted the results that were not anticipated in our guidance, but in total had a minimal impact. The primary items included a gain on the sale of certain shopping center assets in Chile, a tax benefit related to our agreement to sell the Suburbia business in Mexico, as well as the dilutive impact from the earlier than expected completion of the Jet.com acquisition, including transaction costs. Also, recall that last year there was a $0.04 benefit to third quarter EPS due to a lease accounting adjustment.","I'll provide more details about our operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce, where results have improved sequentially throughout the year. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 20.6% and 16.8% respectively, with even stronger growth in the U.S.","The continuing transition of the Yihaodian e-commerce business in China disproportionately impacted the GMV growth rate versus the sales growth rate this quarter due to the mix of first party versus marketplace sales. Excluding Yihaodian in total, GMV increased 28.6%. E-commerce growth includes a benefit from the six weeks of Jet.com results in the quarter, but the GMV growth rate would still be greater than 20% when excluding this contribution.","In the U.S. e-commerce business, we continue to make solid progress expanding marketplace. We're thrilled to have the Jet team onboard and we're moving quickly to accelerate growth. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're making with online grocery. Customer count and basket size continue to outperform our expectations and we've expanded this service to more than 100 U.S. markets.","In China, we expect our broader presence on JD.com with the new Sam's Club flagship store and Walmart Global imports store will accelerate growth. We're moving quickly with e-commerce innovations and taking a fresh approach to how we think about growth.","Now let's turn back to the broader business. Walmart's consolidated gross profit margin increased 34 basis points, due primarily to improvements in the U.S. and International segments. As expected, total SG&A also increased primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology.","We continue to make progress on working capital, driven primarily by continuing discipline in managing inventory and payables. We also had a cash flow benefit this quarter due to the application of new tax guidelines related to the accelerated deduction of remodels and related expenses. In total, we generated $12.2 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, compared to $6.8 billion in the first nine months of last year.","During this transformational time, a key priority remains using our financial strength to provide strong cash returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased 19.6 million shares for approximately $1.4 billion. Year-to-date, we have now returned $10.9 billion to shareholders. As of the end of the third quarter, we have utilized approximately $8.7 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.","Let's now discuss the results for each of the operating segments in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. Overall, we're pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. Sales and traffic increased again this quarter and customer experience scores improved. Walmart U.S. net sales increased 2.5%, or more than $1.8 billion. This growth comes despite persistent market deflation in food, which negatively impacted our food comp by approximately 150 basis points, as well as unseasonably warm weather in the back half of the quarter.","Comp sales increased 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in customer traffic. On a two-year stack basis, comp traffic was up 2.4%, which was relatively consistent with the first two quarters of the year. E-commerce contributed approximately 50 basis points to the segment comp, which was an acceleration from the second quarter. Also, all store formats had positive comp sales, including Neighborhood Markets which delivered comp sales growth of approximately 5.2%.","Gross margin increased 32 basis points. Savings from procuring merchandise contributed to margin rate improvement in general merchandise, food, and consumables. In addition, transportation-related fuel cost savings favorably impacted results. These factors, which reduced cost of goods sold, were partially offset by the continued implementation of our multi-year strategy of incremental price investment.","Operating expenses increased 8.6%, primarily due to the previously announced associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology. In addition, we lapped the lease accounting adjustment that I mentioned earlier, which benefitted last year's U.S. third quarter results. As a result, operating income declined 11.3% for the quarter. Excluding last year's lease accounting adjustment, operating income would have declined 9.8%.","We continue to do a good job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. In the third quarter, inventory declined 2%, with comp store inventory down approximately 6%.","We continue to execute our plan and are making good progress delivering a better experience for our customers. We're pleased with the underlying momentum in the business and feel good about our plans for the fourth quarter. We're well-positioned for holiday with newness, exciting gift items, and EDLP throughout the assortment. All the pieces are in place to ensure a great shopping experience in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of between 1% and 1.5%.","Now, let's move to Walmart International. Walmart International continues to deliver solid results. This quarter, 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and seven of those markets grew comps by more than 4%. Walmex continued to lead the way with comp sales growth of 7%, representing a two-year comp growth of nearly 13%. Our positive comp sales trend again this quarter is a continuation of what we have seen over the last several years. We will continue to focus on driving growth through our fresh offering, expanding online grocery and private brands.","With that, let's discuss International's overall results. Net sales grew 2.4% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 4.8% due to a $2.1 billion currency impact. Operating income increased 11.2% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, operating income increased 1.2%.","In the quarter, there was a gain from the sale of several shopping malls in Chile. Also, recall that in the third quarter last year, we had a favorable impact from a lease accounting adjustment. Excluding both of these items, operating income increased 9.4% on a constant currency basis. We expect a similar gain in the fourth quarter, reflecting the completion of the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile.","Let's now turn to some brief highlights of our key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. As a reminder, in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Additionally, the results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.","Let's begin with Walmex, which released its earnings on October 25th. Keep in mind that Walmex releases results under IFRS and that the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, some results may differ. The positive momentum in the business continued across all formats, divisions, and countries.","Comp sales for Walmex increased 7% in the quarter and total sales increased nearly 9%. In Mexico, comp sales increased 7.3% and continued to outpace the rest of the self-service market, according to ANTAD. In addition, Walmex did a good job managing inventory, which grew at a slower rate than sales growth.","In Canada, net sales increased 3.3% and comp sales increased 1.1%. Comp sales have now been positive for ten consecutive quarters, and according to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in food and consumables, and health and wellness. Our cost analytics program continues in helping drive down cost of goods allowing us to invest in price. In Canada, we also reduced inventory levels even as sales increased.","Turning to the U.K., net sales declined 3.8% and comp sales declined 5.8% in the third quarter. The key priority remains driving an improved customer experience and building sales momentum by simplifying the offer, improving product availability and making strategic investments in service and price. We are moving with pace as we address our customer value proposition in the market.","In China, net sales grew 4.2% and comp sales increased 1.6% this quarter. The key drivers of the performance were strong seasonal and festive categories during the Mid-Autumn Festival and a strong performance in fresh categories, an ongoing focus area for us in China. As Doug mentioned, through our recent alliance with JD.com, we continue to offer exciting new ways for customers to access high-quality products from around the world. It was another solid performance from Walmart International.","Now let's turn to Sam's Club. Excluding fuel, net sales and comp sales increased 1.8% and 1.4% respectively, and membership income grew by 2.3%. Market deflation, primarily in food, negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 110 basis points versus last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed approximately 60 basis points to the comp growth.","Operating income, including fuel, declined year-over-year by approximately 27%, primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses, including planned investments in people and technology, as well as fuel profit and lapping last year's lease accounting benefit. Excluding fuel and the lease-related benefit, segment income decreased approximately 18%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, for the 13-week period ending January 27, 2017, we expect comp sales growth, excluding fuel, to be in a range of 1% to 1.5%.","With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full year EPS guidance. We are increasing the bottom end of our full year adjusted EPS guidance resulting in a new range of $4.20 to $4.35. As a reminder, the adjusted guidance excludes the $0.14 non-cash gain from the sale of Yihaodian in China to JD.com in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, our full year EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.34 to $4.49. The updated guidance assumes that the full year effective tax rate will be between 31% and 32% as well as currency exchange rates remaining at current levels.","In closing, we're pleased with our progress in the business and the positive momentum we're seeing. We're excited for the holidays. Thank you for joining our call today and we wish each of you a happy and healthy holiday season.","Question-and-Answer Session","End of Q&A","This call included certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This is Pauline Mohler, Senior Director of Global Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated. Thanks for joining us today to review the results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016. The date of this call is February 18, 2016. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.","This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by that act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Brett Biggs' remarks later in this call.","Today, in addition to the earnings release, we announced our annual dividend for fiscal year 2017 and you will hear more about that in today's call. Information regarding today's news is available on the Investors portion of our corporate website, stock.walmart.com. At this site, we also post earnings terminology, which includes our definition of adjusted earnings per share, our global unit counts and a slide presentation that we recommend you should review in conjunction with this call and the earnings press release.","The slide presentation has been updated to include the FCPA and compliance-related costs which we have typically discussed in the transcript. As a reminder for fiscal 2016, we utilized a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13 and 52-week periods, respectively. Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 31, 2015, through Friday, January 29, 2016.","Now, let's move on to today's call. Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Incorporated, will provide his thoughts about our results for the quarter and year in the context of our overall strategy. Then, we'll cover the three operating segments, starting with Greg Foran, President and CEO of Walmart U.S.; followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club.","Next, Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce and Technology, is joining us this quarter to share insights regarding our investments in e-commerce. And last, Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO, will wrap up with context around the financial results, along with guidance for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2017.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?","C. Douglas McMillon - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Pauline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our fourth quarter earnings, year-end results and progress against our strategy. We had a solid fourth quarter to close out our fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.49. It's important to note our numbers reflect some discrete items this quarter, including the impact of store closures and certain tax items. And Brett will share more details in a minute.","For fiscal year 2016, adjusted EPS was $4.59. And excluding the $17.2 billion impact of currency, we delivered revenue of $499.4 billion, up 2.8%, which is $13.7 billion of growth. We continue to be pleased with the fundamental trends. We're making progress with customers and associates and feel good about where we're heading. We're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening our digital relationships with customers as we work to become the first to deliver a seamless shopping experience at scale. We'll save our customers not only money but time, and shopping with us will be simple, convenient and fun.","I also want to call out our continued commitment to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we were able to return $4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, today we announced a dividend increase. Our annual dividend was $1.96 and we've increased it to $2 per share. This is the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Walmart.","Overall, this past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth. We do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn't there a year ago.","I want to share a few highlights. As you know, our biggest investments have been in people and technology. On this call one year ago, we announced our investment in higher wages, better training and more department managers to make Walmart U.S. a better place to work and shop. We can only be successful with customers with engaged and empowered associates.","A few weeks ago, we announced the second part of the wage increase. And it's awesome to give a raise to more than 1 million people on the same day. We also announced a simplified paid time-off policy that will mean no waiting for associates to use their time off. These and other changes in the business are making a difference. Our customer satisfaction scores have risen significantly this year and we now have had six consecutive quarters of positive comps and five straight quarters of positive traffic at Walmart U.S.","In the technology and e-commerce space, we continued to innovate with a focus on the customer. We have developed a new platform that we can scale across the business. We have improved our fulfillment capabilities with new fulfillment centers that are helping us get orders to customers' doors faster and more efficiently. And we continued to see growth in store pickup for online orders.","We also expanded online grocery shopping to over 150 locations across more than 20 markets in the U.S. Customers are ordering online and on their phones and then picking up their groceries on our parking lots without ever leaving their cars. Customer satisfaction for those who use our free pickup service is in the high 90s.","We are learning some interesting things along the way. We've found that 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. is one of the most popular times customers order groceries online, usually once the kids go to bed. We also see a healthy number of orders in the middle of the night. These may be parents comforting or feeding infants and ordering more diapers or formula to pick up the next day. While it's been awhile since my kids were that age, I remember those days well. And I absolutely love that we're able to offer convenience and blend into our customers' lives when they need us most.","I'm also excited about the introduction of Walmart Pay. And I was very proud of how different parts of our company worked together on it with a relentless focus on the customer experience. I look forward to us rolling it out this coming year. We recently aligned our technology teams because we want more speed and more customer-centric and cost-efficient innovations like this one. We will deliver one Walmart experience to our customers.","Additionally, we took steps this quarter to sharpen the focus of our portfolio. As part of this continuing portfolio review process, we looked at all of our stores from both a financial and strategic standpoint. One of the key takeaways for me was how strong our portfolio really is, in that we only closed stores representing less than 1% of our global revenue and square footage. I'm pleased, but not surprised, that we have already found open positions for more than half of the impacted associates in the U.S., and we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.","So we're doing what we said we'd do, and we're on the right path. Still, we know we have a lot more work to do. And there are areas of the business that are not where they need to be.","Let's look more closely at each of the segments. Walmart U.S. is on firm ground. We had comp sales of 0.6% on top of last year's 1.5% comp for the fourth quarter. As we lapped positive comps, we accelerated on a two-year stack basis. We also had continued strong performance from Neighborhood Markets.","In addition to our investments in our associates, we're getting better at the fundamentals of retail and managing the business better. We are reducing comp store inventory and improving our in-stock performance. We also had a sound plan for the holiday season that ensured customers could rely on us for low prices throughout the season, not just at big moments.","Walmart International again delivered solid financial performance. Nine of our 11 markets delivered positive comps for the quarter, and I'm very encouraged by the results overall. Walmex, in particular, is in a good groove again. And Canada delivered strong performance. Although we face near-term headwinds with the economy in China, our business there is on track. Brazil, however, is proving to be an increasingly challenging economic environment, and the competitive intensity in the UK continues to increase.","As we review and act on our portfolio, we also announced that we were exploring selling both our clothing chain, called Suburbia, in Mexico and a property company in Chile. Our International business is healthy and growing.","Global eCommerce sales and Gross Merchandise Value, or GMV, globally grew approximately 8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. The holiday season gave a good preview of how all the pieces we're putting in place will come together. We saw strong online sales in the U.S. on the big days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, and nearly half of our customers bought their online orders on a mobile device. We also saw growth in store pickup and online grocery.","We have faced specific challenges in our largest e-commerce markets outside the U.S. Economic softness in Brazil and China continued to weigh on growth and we have been in a transition phase at Yihaodian since acquiring full ownership. As mentioned before, the environment in the UK remains extremely competitive and it's important to remember our e-commerce business in UK is a food delivery and pickup business.","In the U.S., we plan to build on the foundation we've built by delivering a significant assortment expansion and faster delivery at a lower cost this year. We need more GMV growth from our e-commerce businesses.","Sam's Club is in the early days with its new strategy. Comps for the quarter were below what we anticipated. And Food, in particular, underperformed outside of the holiday periods. We're pleased with the work so far to address the fundamentals of the business, to improve merchandising and drive new membership, but we have more to do. There are encouraging signs in our membership numbers. As we address issues with the core business, we're excited by growth in new areas. For example, Club Pickup continued to be the fastest-growing part of the business.","Finally, even as we focus on our customers and our associates, we were reminded a few weeks ago about the opportunity we have to lead in our communities. Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, and PepsiCo announced we will collectively donate water to meet the daily needs of over 10,000 school children in Flint, Michigan, for the balance of the calendar year. Whether it's hiring veterans, supporting U.S. manufacturing, or driving new renewable energy production, we have strengths that can help others in important ways. During the first quarter, we will release our annual Global Responsibility Report, alongside our Annual Report, to share more on how we're making a difference. Leading on social and environmental issues is good for our business, for our shareholders and for the world, and we will continue to move the needle this year.","In summary, we continue to believe we are putting the right foundation in place to better serve customers, deliver stronger sales growth and ultimately strengthen bottom line performance. As we begin this new year, I'm focused on continuing the momentum in our U.S. stores, getting all the ingredients in place for stronger growth in e-commerce and the strategic choices related to how we put them together. I'm also mindful of the need for balance. Improving productivity as we grow is important.","Brett will talk through our full-year forecast, with the first quarter being the most pressured from an earnings point of view due to the timing of the incremental wage investments. This will be another year where we digest foundational investments, and it's important that we build on what we've started as we go through the year.","Now, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory S. Foran - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart U.S.","Thank you, Doug. Over the last 12 months, we've laid out our plan to win in the U.S. now and in the future. We are executing against it and have taken several steps towards delivering on our commitment of growing the top line, increasing market share and delivering shareholder value. We've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm pleased that our fourth quarter results demonstrated solid progress against this plan.","Across the key metrics we track to measure our progress, we're right where we expected to be. Comp sales were positive for the sixth straight quarter and driven by our fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. Our customers are increasingly pleased with the changes in our stores. And they're letting us and others know through improvements in the Net Promoter Score and improved customer experience feedback. In fact, at the end of this fiscal year, more than 75% of stores had met or exceeded their customer experience goals set back at the beginning of the year. This was a significant improvement over the 16% that were meeting this mark at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Additionally, our associates are more engaged, and turnover is lower. Department managers have been hired in key areas of the stores, and our new training programs are underway. New technology is in our associates' hands, and better processes are creating efficiencies in the stores, driving higher in-stocks and a continuing decline in comp store inventory. As we have discussed, there will be more investments necessary to further deliver on our plan, but we have remained on task and we're seeing progress.","Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to address two announcements we've made recently. First, we announced the second phase of our two-year, $2.7 billion investment in our associates. Just two days from now, on February the 20th, we'll raise the starting wage to at least $10 per hour for hourly associates hired before January 1, 2016.","Additionally, we're continuing to simplify our business and enhance our benefits package by shifting to a paid time-off policy for all associates. These changes, along with our previous announcements around training programs and store structure, are exciting for all our associates. We are providing our people with a ladder of opportunity to build a career with Walmart and to provide great service to our customers.","Secondly, in January, we announced the closing of 150 U.S. stores, including all 102 of our Express format locations. Closing stores is never an easy decision, but it's necessary to ensure we are positioned to deliver our long-term plan.","Strengthening the Supercenter and Neighborhood Market formats, while simultaneously delivering a seamless experience with e-commerce, will require our full attention. In fact, we expect to open more than 135 stores in fiscal 2017 alone. While we know that closing stores affected a number of our associates, I'm proud to say that more than half of these associates have already received offers or have been placed in open roles in nearby stores. And we're moving aggressively to identify other open positions for the remaining associates who are interested in transferring to new locations.","Due to the financial impact of the store closures, our reported results differ significantly from the adjusted results and the underlying business performance. As reported, we incurred $729 million in charges related to these store closures. Therefore, unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude the impact of store closures for purposes of comparability. For reported results including the impact of store closures and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.","Moving to our fourth quarter results, net sales grew $1.9 billion, or 2.4%, and comp store sales were up 0.6%. We're pleased with the continued growth in customer traffic, which improved 0.7% this quarter on top of last year's 1.4% traffic gain. On a two-year stack basis, our fourth quarter comp sales improved to 2.1%.","While customers benefited from lower gas prices, we experienced significant headwinds from deflation in meat and dairy products. Additional sales pressure came from warmer than normal temperatures early in the quarter and delays in IRS tax refund checks impacted the very end of the quarter.","Neil will cover our e-commerce initiatives in more detail in this call, but for this quarter, e-commerce contributed approximately 30 basis points to our comp.","Overall, we were pleased with our performance over the six-week holiday season. We made a strategic decision to sensibly pull back on short-term, deep price investments as we looked to simplify the experience for both our customers and associates, and shift back towards a more EDLP focus.","Investments in e-commerce fulfillment centers allowed us to extend the shipping cut-off date. And customers took full advantage of Pickup, ordering their gifts online and conveniently picking them up alongside their grocery trips. As we approached the end of the season, customers transitioned from online to in-store, and we delivered, driving strong performance across the box as customers stocked up on last-minute gifts and food for their holiday meals.","The Supercenter format delivered its sixth straight positive comp in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets continued their strong performance, delivering a 7% comp. We're seeing steady progress in our efforts to improve each of these formats, with a focus on fresh offerings, clean stores, fast check-outs, friendly associates and better in-stocks.","We're pleased with our progress in Grocery, which saw a positive comp this quarter, led by improvement in Consumables. As I mentioned earlier, we experienced substantial deflation in both meat and dairy, which resulted in slight deflation across all of Food. We estimate this deflation negatively impacted our segment comp by approximately 100 basis points, relative to last year's comp. Our Grocery business delivered positive comp traffic growth, even while lapping positive comp traffic from last year.","We continue to push forward with our Win in Fresh initiatives, including testing new layouts, reducing inventory while improving in-stocks in both Food and Consumables, and exceeding expectations in our urgent agenda items such as reducing waste and throwaways. We still have work to do in our Fresh area, and many things we want to accomplish in the upcoming year, but we remain on track.","In our General Merchandise areas, Apparel improved throughout the quarter, after a slow start due to warmer-than-usual temperatures. On-trend assortments, particularly in active wear, drove results in this area. In Entertainment, we continued to experience soft wireless sales and a slower adoption of new technology in televisions.","We're continuing to make progress in this space by focusing on our operating model, including service to our customers, assortment and department layout, but it will take time to get it right. Across the rest of the General Merchandise and Home categories, solid performance came from better in-stocks, assortment updates and new products.","Finally, Health & Wellness remained a positive comp driver for us, with growth coming from branded drug inflation and better in-stocks in OTC. However, a slower flu season created a headwind to our Cold, Cough and Flu business this quarter.","Moving to the remainder of our financials, gross margin was up 69 basis points versus last year. Gross margin rate improved in Food, General Merchandise and Consumables. This was somewhat offset by declines in Health & Wellness, although we're still focused on providing better visibility and tools to help combat ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures.","Transportation costs were helped by lower fuel rates. Additionally, our intentional pullback on deep price investments during the holiday season meaningfully improved margins in Entertainment. Lastly, we made additional progress on our urgent agent items, focused on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise, and remained diligent on improving processes related to shrink.","As expected, expenses increased 129 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by our investments in associates and stores, including transitioning to a new paid time-off policy, along with building out our e-commerce capabilities. However, we did a better job of aligning store labor hours with customer traffic by leveraging efficiencies gained from new processes and technology. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the improvements in gross margin, which resulted in an operating income decline of 5.3%.","We continued to make progress in managing inventory. Overall inventory grew 0.9%, or approximately 25% the rate of total sales growth. Comp store inventory declined 2.9%, as we remained focused on cleaning out our back rooms and using processes such as CAP and top-stock to ensure better in-stocks for our customers. Inventory will remain a key focus area for us in this new fiscal year.","Fiscal 2016 has been a year of redefinition, redefining our goals, redefining our focus and redefining our future. We've been intentional in our design and in our actions, and these actions have resulted in steady progress.","To recap our performance for the year, net sales increased by $10.3 billion, or 3.6%. Comp store sales grew 1.2%, driven by a 1.2% growth in comp traffic. E-commerce contributed approximately 25 basis points to our comp performance. Gross margin improved 14 basis points for the year, helped by our ongoing focus on urgent agenda items and lower transportation costs, partially offset by headwinds from shrink and pharmacy reimbursement pressures. However, the investments in our associates, stores and e-commerce drove expenses up 8.3% versus last year, which resulted in an operating income decline of 7.1%.","We opened 69 Supercenters this year, including relocations and conversions, and 146 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets. In FY 2017, we expect to open 50 to 60 Supercenters, including relocations and conversions. We'll also open 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets.","Additionally, we plan to further expand our online grocery program to more markets this year. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to growth, but we'll do it sensibly, with the customer in mind as we select the right locations, products and service offerings for each store.","We know the decisions we've made this year to improve our business pressured the bottom line, but we're confident they were in the best interest of our customers, our associates and our shareholders. We believe in our long-term plan. And we remain on track to achieve these goals.","In the new fiscal year, we're continuing to march down the path we've laid out. Our initiatives across the box are gaining steam. And we'll look forward to drive improvements in assortment and pricing, while focusing on building a seamless shopping experience across all channels.","We've just held our annual Year Beginning Meeting in Indianapolis, with nearly 7,000 of our operations and merchandising associates. I told the team that I was proud of their hard work and progress last year, and this year, we would build upon that as we work to execute with excellence. In fact, we have raised the bar higher with new annual goals in our stores to drive an even cleaner, faster and friendlier customer experience as the year goes on.","We expect these efforts, along with the ongoing investments in our stores and our associates, to drive continued growth in the top line. Lower fuel prices will also provide some tailwinds. However, food deflation, which has accelerated in the last six weeks, will remain a challenge.","Given these factors, for the 13-week period ended April 29, 2016, we expected a comp sales increase of around 50 basis points. Last year's 13-week comp ended May 1, 2015, increased 1.1%. As a reminder, the investments in our associates will be an expense headwind this year, most significantly in the first quarter, as we implement phase two of these investments prior to lapping last year's phase one implementation, which started in April. However, we will continue to focus on lowering costs through better buying and operating a better business.","Now, I'll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?","David Cheesewright - President & Chief Executive Officer, Walmart International, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Greg. I'm pleased with our progress this quarter in a challenging global economy. We're delivering our strategy, seeing comp sales improve, and bringing in profit ahead of our expectations. Whilst our performance was driven by Walmex and Canada, our results reflect broad achievement. Nine of our 11 markets had positive comps this quarter and seven of our markets have now maintained positive comps for at least seven quarters in a row. We continue to see headwinds in the UK, China and Brazil, which I'll discuss more in a moment.","We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, which are to: actively manage the existing portfolio; deliver balanced growth; be the lowest cost operator; and build strong foundations in talent, trust and technology.","In terms of the portfolio, we announced the closure of 115 small, underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets. Whilst these are difficult decisions for our markets and associates, it better positions us for growth in the right formats and geographies.","Recently, we also announced that we're pursuing the sale of our Suburbia apparel business in Mexico and we're in the process of selling our shopping centers in Chile. These are successful businesses, but aren't a core part of our portfolio strategy. These changes would help drive greater simplicity to our operations and an increased focus on our strategic priorities.","For balanced growth, I'm pleased with our comp trends and look forward to opening between 200 and 240 stores this year across our portfolio, while at the same time expanding our reach in e-commerce. Our lowest cost operator initiative is focused on two key areas, cost of goods sold and overhead reductions. On cost of goods sold, we started a cost analytics program that provides improved tools and cost visibility to our merchants, which enables them to lead fact-based negotiations with suppliers. We're pleased with early results from this program in Canada and the UK and will expand the program to additional markets later this year.","Now, let's discuss our overall results. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3.3% on a constant currency basis, slightly higher than last quarter. Reported net sales declined 9.7%, impacted by a $4.7 billion currency headwind from continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As mentioned, we had a strong quarter for comp sales. In our five largest markets, Mexico, Canada and Brazil reported positive comps, while the UK and China reported negative comps. All other markets had solid positive comp sales.","Operating income declined 7.8% on a constant currency basis, negatively impacted by $215 million in charges, $153 million on a reported basis, related to previously-announced store closures. Excluding this and certain other charges this year, such as restructuring costs, as well as last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 19%.","On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than net sales at 4.2%. This increase was driven primarily by China, where inventory increased in preparation for Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, inventory declined 10.2%. For the full year, net sales grew 3.2% on a constant currency basis, with improved comp sales on top of 3.6% growth last year. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact of $17.1 billion on our reported results, by far the largest one year impact in our history, resulting in a net sales decline of 9.4% on a reported basis. Full year operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis, driven by store closures this quarter. Excluding this and last year's store closure costs in Japan, operating income would have increased. On a reported basis, operating income declined 13.4%.","Now, let's discuss fourth quarter results for our largest markets, presented on a constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce.","Let's start with Mexico, which was the biggest driver of this quarter's results. Walmex released its earnings on February 16 under IFRS, while results here are under U.S. GAAP, so some numbers may differ. Walmex net sales increased 9.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Mexico net sales grew 9.7% and comp sales increased 8.6%, driven by increased customer spending and solid execution from our stores. Self-service was particularly strong, with comp sales of 8.8%, while the rest of the market, according to ANTAD, grew only 4.9%.","Sam's Club also had its best performance of the year, delivering comp sales of 7%, driven by strong sales from Advantage, or non-business, members. Operating income declined versus last year, driven by a planned reduction in our gross profit rate.","Let's next discuss Canada, which had another strong sales quarter. Net sales grew 5.8%, benefiting by strong customer traffic as a result of our improved Fresh offer, continued price investments and improvement in operational standards. Comp sales were 4.3%, our seventh consecutive quarter in positive territory. I'm especially pleased with our sales in Canada, given the economic pressures in the oil-producing provinces.","We had positive market share gains in Food, Consumables and Health & Wellness, for the 12 weeks ended January 23, according to Nielsen. Our online sales continue to grow and perform well. Operating income was down versus last year, due to certain land impairments and pre-opening expenses for 13 previously-announced stores acquired from a former competitor. Excluding these impacts, operating income would've been positive.","Let's talk now about the UK, which continues to face challenging market conditions. Grocery market sales fell 0.2% in the 12 weeks ended January 3, according to Kantar. This was driven by price deflation of 1.8% as a result of intense competition, and was the 17th consecutive period with deflation. The big four grocers remained under pressure as discounters continue to grow and gain share.","In the UK, we're striking a balance between investment in the customer offer, profit and cash flow. Overall, net sales declined 4.4%, and comp sales, excluding fuel, were down 5.5%, driven by declines in our large store format and in our Food business, partially offset by continued growth in online grocery. We decided not to participate in Black Friday discounting, which impacted our comp sales, but helped profitability and allowed greater focus on operational standards and the customer offer in the core Food business. We delivered strong cash performance as a result of disciplined management of CapEx and working capital.","Asda is focused on repositioning its business through Project Renewal, which will simplify operations, lead to substantial reduction in costs and allow for significant investments in customer value. As part of this project, we're deploying a new cost analytics program to aid with buying. We're also joining EMD, a European buying alliance, and we recently completed the purchase of two meat processing businesses. These actions will help increase buying efficiencies and remove costs from the supply chain, particularly for private label products.","The UK has also completed a restructuring of its home office aimed at increasing focus and improving operational agility. In addition, the UK will invest an additional \u00a3500 million in price during the period of its five-year strategy, on top of the \u00a31 billion previously committed. We're taking aggressive actions and we're focused on repositioning our offering to meet the changing needs of our customers.","In China, despite ongoing economic challenges and slower GDP growth, we continue to gain share for the 12th consecutive quarter in the hypermarket channel, according to Nielsen. Net sales grew 0.3%, driven by new store openings and improved performance from completed remodels. Comp sales fell 3%, in part, due to warmer weather and disappointing sales in winter seasonal categories.","We continue to make progress in building a platform for sustainable growth in China. We're benefiting from our earlier actions to centralize our buying offices and build out our supply chain. We've improved our gross margin rate and have realized benefits from productivity initiatives, while investing in labor and customer experience. We can see momentum building as performance in Fresh has improved in recent quarters in both sales and margin. Operating income continues to grow faster than sales.","The team in China is focused on delivering a trusted shopping experience through both physical and digital channels. We're starting to see the benefits from tighter collaboration with Yihaodian. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou, Walmart now leverages Yihaodian's last mile network for online orders, which has led to greater delivery capacity. Overall, we're excited about the actions we're taking in China that are setting us up for long-term growth.","In Brazil, we continue to face political and economic instability. The deterioration in the macro environment, combined with persistent high inflation, continues to put a strain on customers. Net sales grew 1.2% and comps grew 0.8%, in a retail market that contracted by 5.7%, according to Serasa Experian. We were encouraged by another quarter of double digit growth in our wholesale business, mostly offset by continued softness in the hypermarket format.","Operating income was down versus last year, driven by the cost to close the 60 stores announced earlier. Excluding store closure costs, operating income would have been relatively flat to last year.","We're seeing positive results from some of our transformation initiatives, such as repositioning the customer proposition in our wholesale business, but there's still work to be done. Brazil's focus for the year ahead will be to finalize store closures, revise and reposition the customer proposition for our hypermarket format, and complete the integration of systems and processes in our stores. We are committed to turnaround efforts in this important market.","As I wrap up, I'd like to recognize the efforts of our dedicated international associates operating in 28 countries around the globe that helped us achieve consistently good results throughout the year. I'm confident in the management teams we have leading our markets and the strategic priorities we have in place to drive further growth in the year ahead.","Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?","Rosalind Gates Brewer - President & Chief Executive Officer, Sam's Club, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. I'll start today's call with details around our fourth quarter performance. I will also provide an update on how we have begun to execute against the strategy that I detailed during our third quarter earnings call.","At Sam's Club, we remain laser-focused on our members. Through investments we've made and will continue to make in people and technology, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across our app, our site and our clubs.","Let's begin by talking about our fourth quarter results. It's important to note that our reported results were negatively impacted by certain charges totaling approximately $77 million. This amount includes a charge of approximately $57 million resulting from our decision to close underperforming clubs. The remainder of the charges includes a policy change related to paid time-off as well as severance and other costs associated with recently-announced organizational enhancements. Unless otherwise noted, today's financial discussion will exclude fuel for purposes of comparability. For results with fuel and additional information, please refer to the accompanying presentation posted with this transcript.","Comp sales for the fourth quarter were below our expectations. Severe winter storms significantly disrupted approximately 200 clubs toward the end of the quarter, which resulted in a negative impact to the comp of approximately 30 basis points. That said, we know that our core comp performance can improve, and it will. The work we have underway, which I'll talk about in just a bit, is designed, in part, to improve the fundamentals of our business, specifically membership and merchandising.","Broadly speaking, trends that we saw throughout the year were again prevalent during the quarter. Among the most notable items were: softness in Food, primarily as a result of a minimal level of inflation or, in some instances, deflation in key categories; an impact to Grocery as we began to evolve the assortment; and challenges in the Technology and Entertainment area from a deliberate transition in space reallocation along with pressures in wireless. Yet, we know that where we have seen innovation in the assortment and in service offerings, we have seen success. I'll talk more about our merchandise categories in a moment.","Net sales decreased 0.1%, as comp sales declined 0.5%. Slide 10 of the financial presentation provides the components of our comp sales. We were pleased with the performance of our Savings members, as positive momentum in traffic continued, but softness from our Business members negatively impacted our results.","Gross profit rate decreased four basis points from last year. We continue to invest in membership value through price and our Cash Rewards program. Operating expenses deleveraged during the quarter. As expected, investments in people and technology pressured our expenses. Additionally, charges for the items I mentioned earlier impacted Q4. Excluding these items, operating expense as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat compared with last year.","Membership income increased 5.6% during Q4. Plus renewals increased 35% over last year. And we continued to see a favorable trend of renewal rates for Plus members. The value of a Sam's Club membership is clear. Our targeted marketing programs resulted in new membership acquisitions that accelerated each of the last three quarters versus last year.","Let's turn now to our merchandising categories. I'll provide details on areas that were materially impactful to the quarter. Please see Slide 11 of the accompanying presentation for the comp performance of the remaining categories.","In Fresh\/Freezer\/Cooler, deflationary trends continued, particularly in fresh meat and dairy. We saw positive results in produce, yet headwinds from the remainder of the category proved too much to overcome. Dry Grocery and areas of Fresh experienced pressures from deflation. As we continue to expand our private brand, generate more newness and reallocate space, these areas are gaining member acceptance, but take careful handling and coordination.","Technology, Entertainment, Office had some bright spots with new items in TVs and wearables, both of which perform well online and in clubs. Wireless installment plans continue to place pressure on the category.","When we innovate, we see good results. In Health & Wellness and Consumables, our Free\/4\/10 (46:47) Plus benefit program in Pharmacy is helping to lift the total category. Services are important to our members, and they reward us when we deliver in this space. The technology services company, IMS Health, measures our market share of the five free scripts in the program. According to IMS, we grew share by 11 basis points for the three months ended December 31, 2015, and our share is nearly 25 basis points higher than it was prior to the launch of the program. Free\/4\/10 (47:20) was also a strong contributor to membership upgrades to Plus since the beginning of the fiscal year.","Moving on to e-commerce, this year, we made the decision to push many of our holiday events online, and we were pleased with response from our members. Our Holiday Savings Celebration on November 14 drove good results, and we were pleased with other events, including Cyber Monday. During the quarter, traffic to our site increased by 7% versus the prior year, and the conversion improved by 18%.","We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in our pure e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities. We're also excited about the integration of our digital and physical offerings. During Q4, Club Pickup increased 46% over last year, and it now represents the fastest-growing piece of our business. Members want to shop with Sam's Club how and where they choose, and we are building the infrastructure across multiple channels to deliver that experience.","On our call from Q3, I talked about a new strategy. During Q4, we began to execute against that strategy in important ways, including: additional organizational enhancements that will better align talent with critical needs; portfolio management through the closure of underperforming clubs; an extensive review of merchandise categories; and the expansion of private label brands in key areas. These are only a few examples, and we have many other work streams underway. The totality of these efforts will address the fundamentals of our business, including membership and merchandising, as well as deliver new services and offerings.","As I think about guidance for the first quarter, I'm reminded that, although we have accomplished a great deal over the previous months, it remains early days in our transformation. As a result, comp sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2016, are expected to be around flat.","Let me close today with a few thoughts. First, the new alignment of our organization will position the business to better serve our members. It was a significant step in our transformation, and we will begin to see the benefits in the coming quarter. Secondly, our new Chief Merchandising Officer has conducted a comprehensive review of our merchandise based on identified markets and what he has gleaned from our strategy work. We are excited about his early insights at this stage.","I'm confident we're taking the business in the right direction now and for the future. Through a disciplined, refined approach to growth, we will deliver for our members a seamless shopping experience across app, site and club.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Neil. Neil?","Neil M. Ashe - President & Chief Executive Officer, Global eCommerce and Technology","Thanks, Roz. I want to pick up on Doug's comments about our opportunity to be the first to offer a seamless shopping experience at a scale that only Walmart can deliver. E-commerce at Walmart is about bringing together all of the pieces to help customers buy the items they want at Walmart prices, however and wherever they want. Our customers look at us as one Walmart, one easy experience across our app, site and store or club.","In a short span, we've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We have rolled out a new technology platform and we have dramatically increased our physical distribution network. And, in just the past six months, we've grown to serve over 20 markets with online grocery. During the fourth quarter, we started to get a glimpse into how these capabilities we put into place are starting to come together to deliver the seamless customer experience.","Looking forward, we're focused on three big opportunities: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. For the quarter, Global eCommerce sales and GMV both grew at 8%. For the full year, sales grew 12% and GMV grew 13%. As we discussed in October, growth continues to be pressured by weakness in Brazil, China and the UK, due to macroeconomic and competitive challenges.","In China, we have rebuilt the Yihaodian leadership team since taking full ownership, and they continue to build on the strengths of their mobile engagement with customers and increasing business through imported products. There is work to do there, but we are taking actions to improve the business and accelerate growth in one of our key markets. In Brazil, the team has been working to balance growth and profitability during an economically challenging period that we expect to continue throughout the fiscal year.","In the U.S., we continue to grow the business and created a more seamless experience for our customers across our app, our site and our store. Looking more closely at holiday in the U.S., Walmart.com saw strong sales on the big days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. What was most exciting was how our new capabilities started to deliver seamless shopping for customers. As customers shopped on Walmart.com, our new platform was powering the front and back-end shopping experience for the first time during holiday. Despite the complexity of a complete platform rebuild, Pangaea handled the intense holiday volume.","Customers could order gifts even closer to Christmas this year and they saw our best on-time delivery rates ever, thanks to our new fulfillment centers. While the FCs opened just a few months before holiday, they lived up to our targets for efficiency and productivity. They showed that they can scale with our business and combine with our stores, DCs and transportation network to deliver speed, efficiency and better experiences for customers.","Customers could also get their online orders the same day in stores, and we saw nearly a 40% jump in store pickup during holidays. We were also able to blend our online and stores to serve customers how and where they were shopping. One great example was on the morning of Black Friday, when we saw a smart TV sell out online within 20 minutes. We had another TV from that supplier available in stores, so we dialed up the promotion on Walmart.com and made it available for store pickup. The item quickly sold out in stores. To customers, it was a seamless access to a gift they wanted. It was a great example of the power of combining online with stores in close proximity to customers.","Customers were also using our app to shop seamlessly across online and stores. We offered early access to the Black Friday circular on the mobile app for the first time, and the app jumped to the number one spot in the Apple App Store that day. Customers also showed that they are now comfortable buying on their phone. This year, more than half of online sales were on a mobile device on Thanksgiving, which was double last year. We saw significant growth in mobile sales for the rest of the peak holiday period. With our app, customers were also able to create wish lists, check-in for store pickup and pick up item locations in stores.","We continued to build on that app experience in the quarter with another powerful tool, Walmart Pay. We started testing it in a small group of stores and the initial feedback from customers reinforced that the experience was simple and easy. Walmart Pay is the perfect example of how our app gives customers a seamless experience that merges digital and physical to make shopping faster and easier, and it gives customers a reason to form a digital relationship with Walmart. It was also a great example of how our teams aligned to deliver these experiences in just a few months.","At Samsclub.com, we started the holidays with a big kickoff event on November 14, which delivered a triple digit comp for the day. We also saw strong comps and record sales on the biggest days of the holiday season. Club Pickup continues to be a delighter for members, and we saw it hit an all-time high in December. We saw strong growth in both desktop and mobile conversion, and mobile purchases nearly tripled over last year. Samsclub.com has also continued to drive growth in digital member sign-ups.","As we look at critical touch points that meld our app, site and store, we obviously think about online grocery. In October, we announced we were expanding from five markets to over 20. We've rolled out to those additional markets and we're continuing to see the strong emotional response it triggers with customers and the very personal relationship they're forming with Walmart. Customers are literally jumping out of their cars to rave about it. And one of my recent favorites was a mom with two kids in the back of her car. She told us about how much easier it has made her life because she can shop where and when it's convenient and then drive up and just get her groceries. She placed her order while she was relaxing and watching her kids play. Customers are inviting us into the fabric of their lives. In just a few months, we've dramatically increased online grocery, and look for us to continue expanding this year.","Behind all the capabilities we're delivering are some of the best technologists in the world. We've built an e-commerce technology company inside of Walmart. We've always had one of the strongest enterprise technology organizations. Those teams have worked closely to deliver experiences like online grocery and Walmart Pay that seamlessly merge the app, site and store. Last month, we announced that we are bringing together those teams under a single Walmart Technology banner. This aligns all of our technologists with how our customers see us, one Walmart.","I'm excited about the building blocks we've put in place for the future and the ways we're starting to serve customers seamlessly across our app, site and store. We've replatformed our technology and physical distribution, while continuing to grow our business, and we've quickly grown online grocery. This year, we'll focus on three areas: continuing to build a digital relationship with our customers; scaling our online assortment; and expanding online grocery. All these will combine to offer customers compelling experiences that let them shop seamlessly with Walmart in ways that help them save money and save time. As we deliver that seamless experience across our app, site and store, we're building deeper relationships with customers. This relationship is key to building value for the enterprise.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Brett. Brett?","Brett M. Biggs - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Neil. I'll wrap up today by providing some thoughts on the company's performance in fiscal year 2016, as well as our expectations for fiscal year 2017. Before we jump into guidance, I want to highlight a few items from the quarter and the year.","Overall, we are pleased with the way we ended fiscal year 2016. In the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 0.6%, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the fifth straight quarter of positive traffic. For the year, Walmart International delivered another solid financial performance, with very strong results in Canada and at Walmex. We generated full year constant currency revenue growth of nearly $14 billion, or 2.8%. Currency impacted our full year revenue by over $17 billion.","We continue to innovate and make progress toward a seamless shopping experience through a number of initiatives, including an increased number of online grocery markets. While we would've liked to have seen higher e-commerce sales growth this quarter, we continue to make good foundational progress for the future. For the year, we generated approximately $27 billion in operating cash flow, which speaks to our continued financial strength as we transform the company. I'm particularly pleased with our inventory performance in Walmart U.S.","During the year, we returned over $10 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are able to deliver consistent returns to shareholders while investing for the future. ROI decreased to 15.5%, primarily due to lower operating income as well as continued capital investments. Additionally, today, we announced an increase in our dividend from $1.96 per share to $2 per share in fiscal 2017. We've now increased our dividend for 43 consecutive years.","Now, I'd like to spend some time specifically on our EPS results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS were $1.49 and $4.59, respectively. Our reported EPS for the same periods were $1.43 and $4.57, respectively. Let me briefly discuss the discrete items that were factored into our adjusted EPS.","Recall, in January, we announced the closure of 269 stores globally. Charges for these store closures, which impact both the fourth quarter and full year earnings, resulted in a negative impact of $0.20 per share. Also, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full year benefited from the December passage by Congress of the tax extenders legislation, which we considered in our fourth quarter guidance. However, the fourth quarter and full year effective tax rate also benefited by $0.14 per share related to other discrete tax items in the quarter. Finally, our full year adjusted EPS also excludes the effects of a benefit of approximately $0.04 from an adjustment for certain leases we disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.","Now, let's shift gears and discuss fiscal year 2017 guidance. We remain confident that the investments we are making in our associates, our stores and our digital capabilities are the right ones and are better preparing Walmart for the future. It's also important to note that, although we continue to invest in these important areas for the future, we will remain focused on managing expenses across the company. Our guidance today includes several important assumptions, including that the economic conditions in our largest markets remain generally consistent and that the currency exchange rates remain at current levels.","From a capital standpoint, as we indicated at our October Investor Meeting, we expect capital investments to be approximately $11 billion in fiscal year 2017, down from fiscal year 2016.","Currency remains a headwind for our business, as it is from many U.S. multinational companies. Today, we expect a currency headwind of approximately $12 billion on net sales for fiscal year 2017. Additionally, currency is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.10 per share this year, including approximately $0.03 in the first quarter.","Now, let's turn to full year sales growth guidance. In October, we guided that on a constant currency basis, net sales would grow 3% to 4% annually over the next three years. Excluding the impact of the recently-announced store closures and the continuing impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our fiscal 2017 sales growth guidance would have remained in that same range. However, including store closures and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar, we now expect net sales growth to be relatively flat in fiscal year 2017.","As for taxes, our earnings per share guidance is based on a fiscal 2017 estimated tax rate ranging between 31.5% and 33.5%. As is the norm, our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. In any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range.","I also want to note that historically, the tax extenders legislation has been approved at the end of each year, impacting the fourth quarter tax rate. In the December legislation, many of the relevant tax provisions were either made permanent or passed through 2019. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2017, the benefits of the extenders will be spread across the full year, rather than all being in the fourth quarter. Other discrete items as described above may still cause the effective tax rate to fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","Taking into account the previously-mentioned assumptions, including currency rates at today's levels, tax rate and the incremental wage investments of $1.5 billion, we expect full year fiscal 2017 EPS to range between $4 and $4.30. This most closely compares to our adjusted earnings per share of $4.59 in fiscal year 2016 and is broadly in line with our guidance from October for our earnings per share to be down 6% to 12% in fiscal year 2017.","With respect to the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to range between $0.80 and $0.95. This compares to the $1.03 we reported last year. When comparing to last year's EPS, it's important to note that the first quarter this year will be impacted somewhat more on a year-over-year basis than subsequent quarters due to the timing of wage investments.","In closing, I'm honored to serve as the Chief Financial Officer during this very exciting time at Walmart. All of us at Walmart are pleased with the progress we're making and the work of our great associates around the world. We look forward to building on that and serving our customers in the future.","Operator","This call included and the accompanying financial presentation, which is available at www.stock.walmart.com, include certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The date of this call is August 14, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.","(Playback Navigation Instructions)","This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act.

Additionally, a supplemental slide deck that summarizes our key financial results should be used with this call. That presentation appears at the end of this transcript. We believe that this deck provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under financial reporting.","As a reminder, in Wal-Mart International, we provide results and commentary on primarily our five largest markets, all of which had revenue in excess of $10 billion in fiscal 2014.","For fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar, with our Q2 reporting period from May 3rd, 2014 through August 1st, 2014.

Throughout the discussion of our e-commerce performance, we are referring to our results on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned last quarter, the net gain from the sale of our Vips restaurant business in Mexico has been recorded in this second quarter\u2019s discontinued operations. Note that certain reclassifications have been made to Q2\u2019s results. Due to the results from discontinued operations, EPS for Q2 last year is now $1.23, not the $1.24 presented in last year\u2019s release. These reclassifications did not impact consolidated net income. There will be no EPS impact for Q3 and Q4.","Please mark your calendar for our annual meeting for the investment community, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting. We will kick off with dinner with management the evening of Tuesday, October 14 in Northwest Arkansas. The meeting will run through approximately 3 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, October 15. So, now let\u2019s get down to our agenda for today\u2019s call.","Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover our key results and provide an overall assessment of our business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then, we\u2019ll cover our results. Greg Foran, who took over this week as President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., will kick things off. He\u2019ll be followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, who\u2019s traveling and calling in for today\u2019s call. And, Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, will update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on our e-commerce businesses around the world. And, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with a focus on our guidance for the full year and the third quarter.","Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased that Wal-Mart delivered solid earnings per share of $1.21, well within our guidance range, and that our consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion over last year to $119.3 billion.","As I look at our second quarter results in the context of our overall strategy, we\u2019re encouraged by the performance of our small format stores and e-commerce, areas where we\u2019re investing significantly this year. But, we wanted to see stronger comps overall in Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club. Stronger sales in the U.S. businesses would\u2019ve helped our profit performance in the quarter. We can get better operationally and we will.","In an environment where customers have so many choices about where to shop and how to buy, and many of them are feeling pressure on their budgets, we have to be at our best. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to deliver a compelling customer proposition of low prices and quality service for every transaction. For many years, we\u2019ve stressed that we run this business one store at a time, and that\u2019s still true today. So, we\u2019re investing in our stores during the rest of this year to deliver positive comp sales through operational excellence.","Now, let me review the second quarter results. Wal-Mart International turned in a very solid performance, with operating income up over 9% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m pleased with the work that Dave and his team have done to manage expenses, improve profitability and drive sales. On a constant currency basis, net sales rose more than 5%, and comp sales were positive in all but one international market. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the healthy sales improvements in some of our largest markets.","Our Wal-Mart U.S. business added approximately $1.9 billion in net sales and delivered a flat comp. I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re gaining traction on our goal to have a positive comp by year end, but I\u2019m not satisfied. Customers are responding to Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately 5.6% comps in the quarter. Operating income was pressured by investments in additional associate hours and by higher healthcare costs. We\u2019ll keep working during the back half of this year to get the combination of price investments and store associate hours right to deliver improved comp sales and serve our customers in a way that exceeds their expectations here in the U.S.","Last month, we named Greg Foran the new CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. I\u2019ve worked closely with Greg for the past few years, and his depth of retail knowledge will serve our customers and associates well. As our company evolves, we\u2019re focused on delivering a customer-driven retail offering that drives sales. Greg is the best person to execute this strategy in the U.S., and I am thrilled to have him leading this effort. I also want to thank Bill for his years of service to Wal-Mart. His passion for our mission, dedication to our associates and our customers, and innovative thinking pushed us forward. From his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs to the progress we\u2019ve made with our small formats, Bill had a meaningful impact on our company for which we are grateful.","Sam\u2019s Club delivered a flat comp this quarter, with net sales lower than expected. Operating income was lower than last year, due to the anticipated investment in Plus member Cash Rewards. I\u2019m encouraged by the solid growth in membership income this quarter, but I\u2019d like to see a positive comp. During a recent visit to a Sam\u2019s Club in Omaha, Nebraska, it was great to see associates energized about the club\u2019s back-to-college merchandise. They were eager to show the treasure hunt of on-trend color in home and apparel. They also helped members find the electronics and small appliances to accessorize a student\u2019s apartment. We\u2019re taking the right steps at Sam\u2019s Club to improve sales, with new merchandise offerings and localized assortment. We expect that our investment in new membership enhancements, such as Cash Rewards, will increase the membership line. Roz will cover how these programs will impact our profit comparisons over the next year.","You\u2019ll hear more details from Neil in a few minutes, but there are some exciting things happening in e-commerce and mobile. I\u2019m really pleased that sales continued to be robust, growing approximately 24% this quarter. We saw double-digit e-commerce growth from our four most important markets: the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. We continue to add exceptional talent to our teams through organic hiring and small acquisitions. To improve our customers\u2019 online experience, we recently started the rollout of a global technology platform. U.S. customers will appreciate the site\u2019s streamlined search and navigation functionality that personalize the user\u2019s experience. A better checkout process is coming in the near future.","From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019ve started construction on another new e-commerce fulfillment center, this one in Indiana. Investments like these will allow timely and cost-effective delivery of merchandise to millions of additional customers.","All of these initiatives are about changing with our customer. Our enterprise strategy dictates that we move with speed and agility to serve our customers more effectively. We\u2019re pushing to save them time and money, both in store and online. Because the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred, we must be nimble to adjust so that we can exceed customer expectations. Customers are rational. They respond to low prices, innovative products and the service they expect. So, we must run stronger stores everywhere we operate, with better merchandising, in-stock levels and quality service. I\u2019m confident that we can improve comp sales as we deliver on these priorities, and I\u2019m bullish on our core business. Supercenters are still relevant around the world and will play an important role for us for years to come. At the same time, we\u2019re broadening our smaller store base globally, and expanding our digital capabilities everywhere we operate. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to serve so many more customers and drive growth across the enterprise. I believe we\u2019re making good progress, but we\u2019ll keep pushing to evolve faster. Our customers expect this and we won\u2019t let them down.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll take a few minutes today to provide commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter consolidated financial results, along with certain other items. Further details are available for your reference in the presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4.","First, the dollar growth in consolidated net sales exceeded $3.2 billion during the quarter: that\u2019s over $3.9 billion on a constant currency basis. Next, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21 were well within our guidance.","Consolidated membership and other income increased 8.2% to $789 million, primarily driven by strong growth in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club.","Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which includes core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services decreased 1.6%.","Core corporate expenses decreased 6.9% during the quarter. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $43 million, which represented approximately $31 million for the ongoing inquires and investigations and roughly $12 million related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.","The growth in e-commerce support expenses was driven by our continued investment in talent, technology and fulfillment. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil about the exciting work under way in the e-commerce space.","Our leverage services area includes the investments we are making in technology, such as finance and HR back office capabilities and risk and compliance management, including productivity initiatives.","Net interest expense decreased 2.5% over last year. A reduction in interest related to the reversal of certain tax contingencies more than offset an increase to interest expense related to higher debt balances. We continue to anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 6.2%. You\u2019ll hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments.","Payables as a percentage of inventory was 81%, which compares to 85.8% last year, due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority.","I\u2019ll close today by providing a bit of color around returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and e-commerce. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of the timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures.","Although the second quarter presented a few challenges, we had a number of bright spots about which we are encouraged. You heard Doug mention a few of these, and you\u2019ll hear more about them on the remainder of today\u2019s call.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg?","Greg Foran","","Thank you, Claire. Let me begin by saying how honored and excited I am to lead the Wal-Mart U.S. business. I\u2019ve learned a great deal in 35 years as a retailer and look forward to learning more about the U.S. market and from our leadership team, our customers, and our 1.2 million U.S. associates. Now, let\u2019s talk results.","Q2 comp sales performance came in as expected. However, our operating income results fell short of expectations, due in part to investments in wages, as well as healthcare expenses, which were above last year\u2019s levels and above our initial expectations.","Let me provide some additional detail. In Q2, net sales for Wal-Mart U.S. grew $1.9 billion. For the 13-week period ended August 1st, we delivered a flat sales comp; and this was despite a SNAP-related headwind of about 70 basis points. Ticket was up 1.1%, while traffic was down 1.1%, a 30 basis point improvement over Q1. Our e-commerce business, including store-fulfilled sales, delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales growth.","Our comp sales results reflect mixed performances across the business. While food was flat, health & wellness delivered positive comps. Overall grocery was aided by price investments and continued inflation. However, deflation in consumables and industry softness in entertainment created an offsetting comp headwind.","Overall, I\u2019m encouraged by our solid performance during seasonal events, especially during the Fourth of July holiday. I\u2019m also pleased with the consistent strength in Neighborhood Markets and continued market share gains. In the key category of \u2018food, consumables, & OTC,\u2019 we gained 37 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ended July 19th, according to The Nielsen Company.","For gross profit, we continued to invest in price, particularly in the categories of meat and health & wellness. That investment, blended with sales mix, resulted in a gross margin decline of 7 basis points versus last year. From an operating expense perspective, the most notable headwind came from healthcare costs, which led to a 32 basis point decline in expense leverage.","Healthcare costs increased approximately $180 million versus last year and were well above our initial estimates. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the primary drivers of expense growth were increased associate enrollment and cost inflation. While enrollment was higher than anticipated, we\u2019re pleased our associates and their families continue to take advantage of our affordable healthcare opportunities. Near term, we expect continued pressure from health care and anticipate over $500 million in year-over-year expense growth for this fiscal year.","During the quarter, we also allocated additional associate hours to specific areas of the store, such as front end, deli, bakery, and overnight stocking to improve overall customer service. We also sustained incremental labor expenses related to major department re-lays in entertainment and sporting goods. In total, salaries and wages were up more than $200 million compared to last year.","The combination of gross margin investment and expense deleverage resulted in an operating income decrease of 2.4% for Q2. We expect operating income to remain challenged for the balance of this fiscal year, given the increased healthcare costs and our commitment to price investment and customer service.","Now, let me cover the performance of our formats. During the quarter, we opened 35 supercenters, including 24 new units and 11 conversions through relocation or expansion. We plan to open, relocate, or expand about 115 supercenters for the fiscal year. In Q2, our supercenter fleet had a comp decline of approximately 30 basis points. We recognize the need to improve the performance and standards of this format to meet customers\u2019 expectations, and I\u2019ll discuss more about our strategic priorities in my closing remarks.","Neighborhood Markets continued to perform well and delivered an approximate 5.6% sales comp for the 13-week period. Sales were particularly strong in pharmacy, produce, meat, and adult beverages. Comp store traffic grew 4.1%. During Q2, we opened 22 Neighborhood Markets and remain on track to deliver 180 to 200 new units for the year.","Additionally, we continue to learn from our Wal-Mart Express format test and have seen continued solid comp sales performance. We\u2019ll continue to roll out this phase of our test, with approximately 90 stores expected to open this fiscal year.","As a reminder, the majority of Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express units are planned to open in late Q4. We expect this will create operating income headwinds from pre-opening expenses. We also expect higher inventory balances for the back half of the year related to these openings.","Across our network, inventory was up 5% at the end of Q2. Over half the increase was attributed to new store growth, while the remainder was due in part to inflation and carrying incremental inventory from recent department re-lays and modular updates. Better inventory management will be a key focus point of mine.","Now, I\u2019ll review the performance of our merchandise areas.","In grocery, overall inflation accelerated around 60 basis points from Q1 to approximately 1.8% in Q2. Food delivered a relatively flat comp, driven by price investments in targeted categories and regions, solid performance during key seasonal events, and inflation, which was particularly strong in deli, dairy, produce, meat and seafood. However, we continued to face SNAP-related headwinds of approximately 1.6% to food, which we will cycle in November. Looking ahead, we\u2019re continuing to adapt to changing customer needs and will launch our opening price point private label, Price First, nationwide in late Q3. With regards to the consumables business, modest deflation and industry softness led to a low single-digit negative sales comp.","Health & wellness maintained its strong performance from the first quarter, improving comp sales growth approximately 1.8% from Q1. Pharmacy prescriptions delivered a high single-digit positive comp, due to strong script count growth and double-digit% inflation in branded drugs. Script count growth was fueled by new contracts in Medicare and expanded Medicaid coverage. Over-the-counter merchandise also performed well, reporting a low single-digit positive comp driven by a sustained allergy season. With respect to health services, we opened 4 health clinics as part of a new test concept. These innovative primary care clinics offer customers affordable healthcare services, including $4 basic checkups for our associates. We expect to have about a dozen clinics open by the end of the fiscal year.","Our general merchandise business remains impacted by persistent industry softness, particularly in entertainment, where we had an overall double-digit negative sales comp across online and stores. The team is working to mitigate these headwinds. They recently introduced a used video game offering that complements our existing trade-in program. We also re-laid the entertainment department, placing more focus on growth categories and product innovation. In the short term, the significant scope of the re-lay created a temporary business interruption that impacted Q2 results. However, we\u2019re confident this investment is right for the customer and will benefit sales in the back half of this fiscal year. In wireless, we\u2019ve experienced recent comp declines due to a lack of innovation in phone technology and our delay in system upgrades needed to process new carrier installment plans. We\u2019re working diligently to resolve this matter. Our re-lay and wireless impacts overshadowed several favorable results in Q2, including TV comp sales, which were up low single-digits, and VUDU, which was up double digits. Also, toys delivered a low single-digit positive comp due to strength in movie-based merchandise and sports play.","In hardlines, we reported a low single-digit negative comp. While our online business continued to deliver strong double-digit sales growth, our retail stores\u2019 comp sales were down due largely to lapping last year\u2019s strong sporting goods performance. With respect to back-to-school, we\u2019re pleased with our early performance and the response to our in-store teacher appreciation promotion. This program provided a 10% discount on school supplies.","In our softlines business, I\u2019m encouraged by the overall performance of national brands and the growth of our softlines e-commerce business.","Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp. This was driven by national brands and new offerings that are resonating with our customer. For example, national brands, such as Russell Athletic and Avia, drove strong performance in active wear. In addition, customers responded positively to new items and improved value in our ladies assortment. Shoes benefitted from broad assortment, including items at strong rollback prices in seasonal categories and national brands.","Our home business had a relatively flat comp driven by strength in e-commerce and national brands such as Farberware, Shark, and Keurig. This was offset by outdoor living, where we lapped a high single-digit positive comp from last year.","From an e-commerce perspective, we\u2019re continuing to expand our dotcom fulfillment network and recently announced plans for our third fully dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center. This e-DC will open early in 2015 and be located near Indianapolis. Additionally, last week, we rolled out Savings Catcher nationwide, which leverages our data analytics capabilities to automatically match competitors\u2019 ads and strengthen customers\u2019 confidence that they are receiving the lowest advertised price on like items.","Let me shift gears for a minute and discuss our U.S. manufacturing initiative. Bill took me through the terrific work accomplished thus far. I\u2019m excited about the project and remain dedicated to our 10-year, $250 billion commitment. On July 8th, we hosted a Made in the USA open call, facilitating over 800 meetings with more than 500 suppliers. Suppliers heard from senior leadership and participated in an education series related to doing business with Wal-Mart. The results of the event were outstanding, with over two-thirds of our supplier meetings resulting in an immediate decision to purchase products, or to consider them for future buys. Later today, I\u2019ll be meeting with even more suppliers in Denver following our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting to build on the work so many people have already done in our Made in the USA program.","Now as we end the Wal-Mart U.S. portion of the call, I would like to speak briefly about my assessment of the business and priorities.","Wal-Mart U.S. is a great business, with a deep and rich heritage in serving our customers with a smile, in clean, tidy, well-merchandised stores, with terrific low prices and value. A cornerstone of our success has been our wonderful associates, from our stores to our DCs, our Home Office and e-commerce facilities. They still are.","At the core are the Wal-Mart stores, and my initial efforts will focus on the core. We will deliver against these key customer requirements: being in stock, clean stores, the right price, the right items, improved service, better productivity. I will be out in stores hearing directly from our customers and our associates and tracking our performance. I\u2019m a competitive person, so I will be visiting the market place as well. We will look to build momentum.","Concurrently, we must return to growth. In the early years, a good portion of the growth will come from the current core. However, the market place is changing and we will change with it. We have substantial capabilities and assets that position us for future opportunities in the e-commerce market and in new formats. We have been experimenting for years in both the U.S. and in International. I am confident that with a disciplined approach, we will capture more than our fair share of this opportunity.","While it\u2019s early in the quarter, I\u2019m encouraged by a strong start to Q3. However, we know we\u2019re in a challenging retail environment, and it will take some work to continue moving in the right direction. Given that, we expect comp sales to be relatively flat for the 13-week period from August 2 through October 31, 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Dave for the International update. Dave?","David Cheesewright","Thank you, Greg. We appreciate all of the contributions you have made to our International businesses, and we are confident the Wal-Mart U.S. segment is in great hands.","Every day, our associates continue to execute our key strategic initiatives. I\u2019m pleased to say that in the second quarter we delivered solid sales and profit growth, gaining market share in the majority of our markets. As I visit the markets, I see that customers are busier and changing more rapidly than ever before. Busy customers are telling us how they want to shop, and that they want us to do two things: save them time and save them money. They\u2019re looking for faster and, more importantly, convenient ways to shop. I\u2019m encouraged by our progress in driving innovation and accelerating growth in e-commerce to improve our offering and add convenience for our customers.","The global economy remains challenged, which means the customer is also stretched. Price remains a critical factor in our customer\u2019s buying decisions. As an example, during a recent visit to Chile, I saw first-hand how important price is to our customers. Just a year ago, Wal-Mart Chile rolled out a mobile app, which allows customers to compare prices between Wal-Mart and competitors. We had almost 200,000 item scans in this quarter alone. We believe innovations like this and price position will continue to set us apart in the market place.","We remain focused on price investment across all our markets and expect to continue driving improved comp performance. I\u2019m pleased with the trends in many of our markets, driven by a continued focus on being the lowest cost operator.","In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 7 and 8 of the presentation summarize financial details.","For the second quarter, we grew operating income at a rate faster than sales on both a constant currency and reported basis. We are pleased that we\u2019ve grown operating income faster than sales for the full first half of the fiscal year. These results include the charge for certain non-income tax matters of $52 million disclosed in the second quarter of last year. Even excluding this charge, operating income grew faster than sales.","Net sales grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis, or 3.1% on a reported basis. Sales benefited from the Easter shift, strategic price investments, improved assortment and e-commerce growth. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9.3% and 8% on a reported basis, as most markets leveraged expenses.","On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance. Of our five largest countries, only China didn\u2019t deliver positive comp sales. We also saw strong sales growth in Argentina, Chile, Japan and Africa.","Inventory grew faster than sales this quarter and remains a key focus area. While a portion of the increase is related to World Cup promotional items or initiatives to drive sales in the back half of the year, I am disappointed with our position. Each market has a specific plan in place to address inventory.","Now, let\u2019s discuss some market specifics. As you can see in the slide, net sales, operating income and comps are presented on a constant currency basis only.","I will begin with a recap of our EMEA region, where we recently promoted Shelley Broader as the first female Regional President and CEO. Shelley brings a wealth of merchandising and operations experience and has already hit the ground running in this important region.","The U.K. had a solid quarter, growing both net sales and comp sales despite a challenging market backdrop. Comp sales were up 2%, excluding fuel, and 0.5% including fuel. Despite aggressive price investments from competitors, we accelerated our performance and grew share ahead of the total market in the 12 weeks to June the 22nd, according to Kantar.","In addition, The Grocer magazine designated Asda as \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the seventeenth year in a row.","During the quarter, operating profit declined slightly due to the lower margin mix, which was offset by strong cost control and productivity improvements.","To satisfy the evolving shopping habits of customers, we introduced a more flexible management structure across all stores in June. The change places a greater emphasis on areas such as e-commerce and puts more associates on the shop floor, whilst removing historic back-office administration tasks.","Strong e-commerce growth continued during the quarter, with sales up double digits. The rollout of Click & Collect to additional Asda superstores and collection sites, and the extension of store hours offer greater convenience for our customers.","Next to Canada. With Shelley Broader\u2019s promotion, we are pleased to announce that Dirk Van den Berghe joined us August 1st as President and CEO of Wal-Mart Canada, bringing with him more than 30 years of international business experience and expertise in food retail.","In the second quarter, Canada produced solid results in a very competitive environment. We were encouraged by our performance in food and consumables, driven by supercenter expansions. Canada net sales grew 2.9%. Comp sales were positive and improved over the first quarter, as Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s 20th Anniversary event in June favorably impacted results. Health and wellness sales also improved this quarter, with strong comps in OTC. Additionally, fresh offerings drove strong sales in food. We gained 50 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12 week period ended July 19. During the quarter, Wal-Mart Canada restructured its store associate management team to improve customer service and drive savings. Even with the impact of the restructuring charge, Canada leveraged expenses, continuing its strong focus on driving the productivity loop. However, operating income declined year over year due to headwinds in margin, from mix and price investments.","Moving next to Latin America, we\u2019ll begin with Walmex. The Walmex summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported second quarter results on July the 23rd, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. The Walmex results discussed here exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, for which we recorded a $267 million gain in discontinued operations.","Consolidated Walmex sales grew 5.0% and operating income grew 5.7%. Mexico alone grew sales 5.4%, with a comp sales increase of 1.2%. Sales were driven by a favorable Easter calendar flip and strong growth in self-service formats. The net result of the World Cup was relatively neutral overall, with solid sales in electronics prior to the event, but softer sales during the 4 weeks of the World Cup. Mexico leveraged expenses for the quarter. However, operating income continues to be impacted by challenges at Sam\u2019s Club and grew at a slower rate than sales.","Mexico\u2019s self-service business plus Sam\u2019s Club, grew market share by 20 basis points, according to ANTAD for the quarter ending June the 30th. This performance was driven by our self-service formats, gaining 240 basis points. It\u2019s important to note that our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express, and our stand-alone pharmacies continued to deliver strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables by 12.3%. We have a solid price position, and we will continue to invest thoughtfully in price throughout the second half of the year.","To address challenges in Sam\u2019s Club, on May the 30th we announced organizational changes to simplify the structure and strengthen the business. Todd Harbaugh, who has more than 20 years of experience with Wal-Mart, including 11 years in the Sam\u2019s Club U.S. business, leads the club business, reporting directly to Scot Rank. The merchandising division for Sam\u2019s Club in Mexico was restructured into two areas, grocery and general merchandise, both led by seasoned executives. Our team is laying the groundwork for a more aggressive strategy to win back members and acquire new ones. We expect continued near-term challenges, but improvement in the longer term.","Turning to our Mexico e-commerce business, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Wal-Mart.com.mx site launch. We are investing to double distribution capacity in time for the holiday season, and we\u2019ve completed online technology investments with the new mobile apps for both iOS and Android. We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with stores to create a unique shopping experience. We added 116 kiosks for customers who feel more comfortable ordering and paying at the store. We\u2019re also accelerating the growth of our grocery home delivery business, leveraging the Superama experience to expand the offering to supercenters during the third quarter.","Our efforts to rejuvenate performance in Mexico delivered positive results in the self-service formats during the quarter, and we have the right plans in place to continue to improve the overall business.","Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, where we remain focused on turning around the business. Second quarter net sales rose 9.1%, with comp sales growing 9.7%, driven by a positive impact from the Easter flip and strong World Cup sales. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the food and consumables businesses and saw an improvement in general merchandise sales, largely driven by the World Cup. According to Nielsen, our market share declined for the quarter ending June 30 driven in part by store closures within the last 12 months. However, we grew comp sales faster than our largest competitor.","We continued to invest in store integration in Brazil and converted an additional 80 stores this quarter to the new systems. Integration efforts simplify and standardize operational processes, giving better visibility to business results and reducing compliance risk. We are on track to have all stores fully integrated by the end of next year. Despite these integration costs, we leveraged expenses for the quarter, as the team is doing a great job focusing on operational productivity. Operating income was positive.","Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart China\u2019s net sales grew 1.1%, although comp sales declined 1.6%. We continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity programs, as well as price deflation in some key categories. Despite the top line challenges, market share increased in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended June 30, and we maintained market share compared to all modern trade in China, according to Nielsen.","China\u2019s business transformation program continues to deliver substantial operational benefits, allowing us to invest in price and improve our competitive position. We grew operating income significantly over this quarter last year.","Wal-Mart China introduced a home delivery service in 383 stores, and customer feedback has been very positive. Average ticket for home delivery was significantly higher than the average store visit for the quarter. We are building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and we\u2019ve been working on innovative ways to deliver the best experience for our customers.","Now, let\u2019s talk more specifically about our e-commerce sales. We are very excited about the innovation and growth in our e-commerce businesses around the world. As I mentioned earlier, Mexico celebrated the first anniversary of Wal-Mart.com.mx in June. Traffic grew to nearly triple last year\u2019s volume, positioning Wal-Mart.com as one of the fastest growing e-commerce retail businesses in Mexico and the third most visited, according to comScore. In the U.K., same day grocery Click & Collect is now available in most Asda superstores and 188 Click & Collect sites, and total U.K. e-commerce sales were up over 20% from a year ago. Admittedly, off a low base, Canada grew e-commerce sales by triple digits, with an expanded merchandise offer and improved customer experience. Additionally, in July we launched e-commerce sales in India to supply wholesale goods to small local businesses. The initial read in India was good, and we launched ahead of our competitors.","Yihaodian, our e-commerce platform in China, grew traffic again this quarter by triple digits, and ticket growth remains strong. Net sales grew double digits. Strong sales growth in wireless and appliances drove favorable results in the quarter. In Brazil, we again saw double digit e-commerce sales growth, with very strong growth in wireless and games.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the first half results. Despite continued economic challenges and a stretched consumer, we remain well positioned in our markets for the back half of the year. We continue to be optimistic about the future and our teams around the world remain focused on our key initiatives.","So, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thank you, Dave. Performance at Sam\u2019s Club improved this quarter, with approximately 50 basis points of comp acceleration versus Q1. Our business is foundationally solid and over the past year, we\u2019ve been transforming Sam\u2019s Club, with new membership enhancements, elevated merchandise, increased multichannel access, and a heightened use of data and analytics. There is still work to do, but we remain confident that these efforts will serve as a catalyst for our business, increasing the long-term value of being a member.","Our top priority at Sam\u2019s Club remains growth \u2013 growing our member base and growing sales. While our top line sales growth of 1.7%, without fuel, was modest, membership income grew 11.9% in the second quarter, with Plus member renewals a primary driver. This growth is more impressive considering we have now lapped the fee increase initiated last year in May.","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking steps to increase the value of membership. This includes our investment in two new membership enhancements, Plus member Cash Rewards and Sam\u2019s Club cash-back MasterCard, both launched a little over a month ago. This new MasterCard comes with chip-enabled technology, making the card more difficult to duplicate and providing additional security from fraudulent activity for our members.","It\u2019s still early days, but member response has been positive. But, what I\u2019m most proud of is how the associates have rallied behind these programs by building relationships with members and communicating the combined value of both programs.","As Doug indicated, these investments help lay the groundwork for future comp sales growth; however, they also pose an operating profit headwind over the next 12 months. The impact of recent investments, such as Plus member Cash Rewards, can be seen in our financial results, reducing both our gross profit rate and operating income. Further, we expect that this headwind may accelerate in the coming quarters as our Plus penetration grows.","Now, a few thoughts on our performance during the second quarter. When we spoke last, I shared that Q1 got off to a slow start, as members were hindered by poor weather, and our clubs were impacted by higher utility costs. Our lower income Savings members were most impacted, and traffic slowed across the country.","In Q2, however, Savings member traffic improved, progressing towards more historical levels of low single-digit positives. Their growth helped support the 50 basis point comp improvement that I mentioned earlier. The Business member remains pressured, delivering negative comp growth this quarter. Overall, comp traffic growth of 0.3% was offset by a comp ticket decline of 0.3%, netting out to a flat comp for the 13-week period.","So, let me walk you through the financial results, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation.","Net sales grew 1.7% to $13.0 billion. Operating income declined this quarter by 10.2% to $466 million, due to a decrease in gross profit rate and an increase in operating expenses. Operating income, with fuel, declined 4.6%.","Our gross profit rate declined 50 basis points this quarter, with 23 basis points of the decline attributable to our investment in Cash Rewards. We planned and prepared for this cost; however, the additional rate pressures from mix and price investments intensified the decline.","Operating expenses grew faster than sales this quarter by 18 basis points. Several factors contributed to our inability to leverage, including higher healthcare benefits costs versus last year and increased real estate expenses associated with opening 5 new clubs this quarter, versus 1 new club during this time a year ago. Membership and other income grew 10.5%, driven by upgrades and Plus renewals. Late in the quarter, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth. We had almost 130,000 people respond to the offer, which ran from July 21 to August 1. While the majority of the offer redemptions will cross into the third quarter, we have been pleased by the number of new members who have already come into the club to officially activate their memberships.","Inventory management remains a priority for us, with inventory increasing 4.7% this quarter. Builds for new clubs and an earlier set for fall seasonal merchandise contributed to the growth.","Now on to our merchandising results. Our buyers have been working hard to elevate our merchandise assortment, procuring new items at incredible values for our members. We\u2019ve seen good results in areas of the business where we have introduced these new items, such as \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d snacks and apparel. Some of our core categories like tobacco, wireless, and candy, however, remain pressured.","Fresh \/ freezer \/ cooler delivered a positive low single-digit comp, led by solid performance in dairy, fresh meat, and cooler areas. A competitive pricing position and successful 4th of July holiday weekend boosted our fresh meat comp, as members responded to our high-quality assortment of steak, ground beef, and chicken. We continue to see inflation in dairy; however, unit growth was minimally impacted.","Grocery and beverage posted a negative low single-digit comp. The snacks category continues to perform well, driven by \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d indulgences within nuts, trail mixes, chips and popcorn. We are pleased with our recent efforts to assort clubs based on member preferences within wine and spirits, representing over 100 basis point improvement in comp performance over the prior quarter. The growth was tempered by declines in candy and beverages, which were hindered by the deceleration in Business member traffic.","Ancillary, which includes tobacco, declined low single-digits. Tobacco comp sales decelerated, despite a May price increase, with units down mid-single digits.","Health and wellness delivered a positive low single-digit comp. The overall category was lifted by the high single-digit comp in pharmacy, as investments in member value and awareness over the past several quarters continue to drive growth. Within optical, an increased focus on opportunistic buys resulted in a strong assortment of new \u201cfashion sun wear\u201d items \u2013 all at a great value for our members. Over-the-counter is a focus area, as we continue to lap extremely strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items. We have recently introduced several new items in OTC, including new nutrition bars for our health-conscious members, and initial results are promising.","Some of the consumable categories, such as pets and laundry, struggled this quarter, as we continue the transition to newness. This transition period resulted in a negative low single-digit consumables comp. However, our long-term focus on higher quality, better pack-size value and newness continues to accelerate results in the disposable tabletop and paper goods categories, leading to double-digit share gains over the 52-weeks ended July 19, as measured by The Nielsen Company.","While still a negative high single-digit comp overall, we are beginning to see comp improvement within our technology and entertainment subcategories. Our merchants have been surrounding core items, like TVs, with new and exciting tech items, and the results are beginning to show. For example, we\u2019ve added new SKUs within the portable audio category, which had a positive effect on the quarter. We\u2019ve seen comp declines in wireless, as system upgrade delays have affected our ability to provide new carrier installment plans. Home, apparel, and hardlines reported a positive mid-single-digit comp this quarter, led by a strong double-digit comp in kitchen electrics and a high single-digit comp in mattresses. You may recall that mattresses struggled last quarter, underperforming in areas of the country most impacted by weather. Our merchants worked hard to change their approach this quarter, adding a new king size SKU to our assortment with a strong price-point. Member response was clearly positive! Apparel and jewelry continued their exceptionally strong track record \u2013 delivering their fifth straight quarter of positive comps.","Samsclub.com delivered another solid quarter, contributing approximately 30 basis points to the total segment comp. Double-digit sales growth was seen in both direct-to-home and Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull formats, and conversion rates improved across all access points.","This quarter, we re-launched all four mobile platforms, providing easier access and simplified shopping for our members. This includes a completely new iPhone app launched in June, with features that allow Plus members to check their Cash Rewards balance on-the-go. Based on member insights, the mobile team is now releasing new enhancements and updates every 4-6 weeks to ensure the best possible experience.","Speaking of experience, our operations team recently launched a new in-club initiative to provide \u201clegendary member service.\u201d At Sam\u2019s Club, our members have a higher expectation of service because they pay to shop our clubs. The \u201clegendary member service\u201d concept is simple \u2013 we want to ensure that our members are engaged and have a memorable shopping experience with us.","We continue to be optimistic about the future of Sam\u2019s Club, knowing that we have laid the groundwork for success. We expect comp sales to be slightly positive for the 13-week period ending October 31. This compares to a 1.1% comp increase last year.","Just one week ago, we hosted our annual holiday meeting with our field management teams here in Bentonville, Arkansas. Let me tell you, the teams left feeling energized and ready to serve our members. At every level of the organization, we\u2019re laser-focused on 3 key priorities: continued elevation of our merchandise assortment, growing our member base, and strengthening e-commerce, which includes mobile. We\u2019re building momentum at Sam\u2019s Club and remain confident in our ability to deliver positive comp sales during the second half of the year.","I\u2019ll now pass it over to Neil. Neil?","Neil Ashe","","Thanks, Roz. Our e-commerce businesses made significant progress on our strategies and delivered a number of customer-focused enhancements in our core markets. Globally, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% in the second quarter. I\u2019m excited about the capabilities we\u2019ve delivered and how we are integrating the digital and physical worlds to offer customers easier and more convenient ways to shop. We\u2019re working closely with the operating segments around the world to make all of this happen.","Looking at Wal-Mart U.S., we saw double-digit sales growth, and we continued to outpace the e-commerce market overall. The major highlight was that we started to roll out a new Wal-Mart.com site experience. To the consumer, it\u2019s simpler, it\u2019s faster and it\u2019s easier shopping experience. But, it also represents a major technical feat that involves a top-to-bottom rebuild of our entire global technology platform. I\u2019m also really excited about the rollout of Savings Catcher. It\u2019s a perfect demonstration of how we are integrating digital and physical experiences to do the work for our customers, and it reinforces their trust in Wal-Mart\u2019s low prices.","The Sam\u2019s team is moving aggressively on enhancing the digital and physical experience for members. The new iPad app is getting rave reviews from the members, going from 3.7 stars to 4.5 stars in the app store. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in the office category and with the Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull program that allows members to order online and pick up in a club.","We had double-digit sales growth in Brazil, in Mexico and Chile, and triple-digit growth in Canada and Argentina. Of course, we saw a lot of TV sales leading up to the World Cup, but the pleasant surprise was the sales lift in games as a result of good demand for consoles.","In China, Yihaodian delivered high double-digit growth rates in sales for the quarter, and its focus continues to be on the quality of the customer experience. To support these efforts, we completed 40 projects in the quarter, including Customized Message Services for customer support. And, our customer satisfaction reached a new high of 97.7%. Yihaodian\u2019s marketplace business 1Mall also more than doubled.","In addition to the successes in each market, we\u2019re seeing great progress on building out a world-class e-commerce organization and delivering on our strategic initiatives.","On the talent side, we continued to strengthen our Global eCommerce leadership team. Fernando Madeira, who was our President of Latin America eCommerce, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart.com, with responsibility for the U.S., Latin America and further growth of Wal-Mart.com.","We also created a new Chief Operating Officer role for Global eCommerce and are thrilled that Michael Bender, formerly president of the West for Wal-Mart U.S., is now in this role. He will drive operational excellence as we scale our e-commerce businesses and will oversee the expansion of our next-generation fulfillment networks.","With these additions and others, I feel great about the depth and breadth of experience at the leadership level, as well as throughout our organization. We\u2019ve continued to have great success in hiring some of the best technologists in Silicon Valley and around the world. And, we supplemented our hiring with small, targeted acquisitions, including Adchemy, Stylr and Luvocracy this past quarter.","Our talent density is helping us deliver best-in-class technology. We\u2019ve talked about our global technology platform and how it is a top-to-bottom rebuild of everything that powers our e-commerce sites and businesses around the world.","We\u2019ve been delivering a lot of elements of the tech platform this year, but most of those have been technology that customers don\u2019t see, sitting under the hood. What they will now start to see is a new site experience for Wal-Mart.com in the U.S. We previewed the site at a mom blogger day at our Sunnyvale office, and they loved it. One of them, Leticia, was saying how visually appealing the site looked and how much easier it was to find products. Input from customers helped us design the site and will help us continue to make it even better.","The tech platform gives us much greater speed and flexibility. Changes to the site can be made in minutes versus days, so we can innovate, test, iterate and deploy new capabilities in real time. The site has much more personalization, and each customer\u2019s experience is always changing with fresh content that helps them discover new items. We\u2019ve built our own personalization engine to customize the experience. Customers now receive relevant options and recommendations, while they are on the site, and via email and text messages. And, given that more 30 than half of traffic to Wal-Mart.com is coming from mobile devices, we designed the site to adapt to any size device, particularly tablets. In addition to the new global technology platform, we\u2019ve been focused on building our next-generation fulfillment networks around the world to deliver orders faster and more efficiently. We have a new large-scale fulfillment center under construction in Indiana, which will complement those we\u2019ve opened in Texas and Pennsylvania in the past 12 months. We also enabled 20 more stores to fulfill online orders during the quarter, and 20% of units ordered on Wal-Mart.com are now shipped from stores. Our algorithms are helping to determine the optimal shipping point, whether from an online fulfillment center, a store DC or a store. And, in Brazil, we opened a new fulfillment center in Cajamar that is now fully operational. We will announce additional fulfillment centers around the world over the coming months.","We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on our strategic goals, and our investments are delivering for Wal-Mart\u2019s customers. We are pleased that we are growing faster than the market. And, this growth is coming during a time that we are rebuilding almost every aspect of our e-commerce businesses \u2013 building out our team, new global tech platform and next generation fulfillment networks. We expect to see fluctuations as we go through this work, and we\u2019re keeping our eye on the long-term. We started the year with a goal of 30% full-year sales growth. We\u2019re expecting that growth to be in the mid-20s. And, we expect higher growth in our third-party marketplace businesses.","The opportunity for e-commerce is clear and we are stepping up our investment in our e-commerce businesses for the rest of the year.","I will now turn it over to Charles for guidance. Charles?","Charles Holley","","Thanks, Neil. We are now half-way through this fiscal year, and while we have some challenges, we are encouraged by several aspects of our business. Let me cover those examples. During the quarter: Consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion, with Wal-Mart U.S. contributing $1.9 billion of the increase. Wal-Mart International delivered a solid performance, with positive comp sales in all but one market and strong operating income. Earnings per share of $1.21 were well within our guidance. Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the quarter and the year were flat, an improvement over the prior year\u2019s string of negative comps. We\u2019re also pleased that traffic improved. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% on a global basis.","The challenges that we face are reflected in our revised guidance, and I will go through those now. In addition to continuing global macro-economic challenges, there are several specific items that will continue to be headwinds for us in the back half of this year.","First, during the quarter, our U.S. healthcare costs increased $180 million versus last year and were well ahead of our initial estimates. This increase is a result of higher enrollment by our U.S. associates and families, as well as healthcare cost inflation. Enrollment does fluctuate with our hiring. As a result of this increased expense, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $500 million for the fiscal year, which is approximately $170 million higher than our original estimate of approximately $330 million provided in February. That estimate was included in our full year earnings per share range of $5.10 to $5.45. Second, as you just heard from Neil, e-commerce is particularly important to both our customers and our company\u2019s future, and we will continue to invest in areas such as technology, talent, and fulfillment. As a result, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share now assumes $0.05 to $0.07 of incremental investment versus our prior guidance of $0.02 to $0.04. I would like to add that, although we are slightly revising our e-commerce sales growth to 25% for this year, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic goals.","From a tax perspective, the estimate of our full-year effective tax rate remains between 32 and 34%. For the third quarter, we expect our rate to be around 34%. While historically our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year, it\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. We are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed, could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full year.","As we shared with you last quarter, we are investing in Sam\u2019s Club this year. We will continue to support our two new membership enhancements at Sam\u2019s with investments in the Plus member Cash Rewards and the cash-back MasterCard, which both launched in June. As Roz indicated earlier, while these investments will position the business better for the long term, they do pose an operating profit headwind over the next year.","Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the full year to range between $4.90 and $5.15 per share, versus our prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.45. This assumes third quarter EPS to range between $1.10 and $1.20 versus $1.14 last year. Our estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels.","Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. Returning value to our shareholders is clearly one of our financial priorities. In the second quarter, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $307 million of our shares. Our operating results heavily influenced our share repurchase activity. As we look at the level of share repurchase for the first half and the remainder of this year, it is important to remember that we spent $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations, and that we committed an additional $600 million to accelerate small format openings in the U.S.","The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, negatively impacted our cash from operations. Improving our working capital performance is a priority for all of our operating segments.","With that, thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. Have a great day.","This call included certain forward-looking statements.

Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter and the year. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll go to the operating segments. First up, Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. Next, Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International. Then we'll close the operating segment discussion with Rosalind Brewer, commonly known as Roz, our new President and CEO of Sam's Club. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up with his thoughts, as well as EPS guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year '13.","A few reminders before we get into the details. Walmart's consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for our U.S. and Canadian operations and December 31 for all other operations. Walmart International unit counts, with the exception of Canada, are stated as of December 31. Massmart currently reports on a June 30 fiscal year end, but is consolidated into our results on a calendar year basis with a one-month lag.","This year, fiscal '13, is a leap year, and we will have an extra day in our company results for the first quarter and the full fiscal year. Leap year doesn't affect comp sales reporting. We will continue to report comp store sales on the 4-5-4 retail calendar when we announce quarterly earnings. So next year at this time, when we report fourth quarter earnings in February, we'll report a fourth quarter comp on the 4-5-5 basis. Details on comp sales in this call for the countries within Walmart International are on a calendar basis. We look forward to seeing all of you at our annual international meeting for the investment community in Toronto in April when we have an in-depth look at the Walmart Canada business. ","Now Mike, let's get started with our results. Mike?","Michael Terry Duke","Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Today, every segment of our business is stronger than it was a year ago, and we're in a great position heading into this fiscal year. I'm pleased with Walmart's performance for the fourth quarter and the full year. ","Let me start with our most important results.","We are reporting $1.51 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter and $4.54 for the full year. Both of these numbers include net benefits to EPS of $0.07 and $0.05, respectively. Jeff will cover the details behind our EPS shortly.","Walmart U.S. reported positive comp sales of 1.5% for the fourth quarter. And let me point out that this includes positive comp traffic. Sam's Club continued its sales momentum. Comps, without fuel, increased 5.4% for the quarter. International continues to be a strong growth engine for the company, delivering $35.5 billion in sales for the quarter and more than $125 billion for the year.","Net sales, including acquisitions, rose almost 6% for the year to approximately $444 billion. Our company leveraged expenses for both the quarter and the full year. Walmart has now leveraged operating expenses for 2 consecutive years.","The company returned $11.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this year. These results demonstrate our commitment to delivering growth, leverage and returns for our shareholders. They also reinforce our belief that Walmart remains the best positioned global retailer.","It's was 50 years ago this year that Sam Walton started our company with a single store in Rogers, Arkansas and the promise to help customers save money so they can live better. He saw an opportunity to deliver on that promise. And today, our associates serve more than 200 million customers every week around the world.","Our price leadership is making a difference across the United States as many family families are settling in to a new normal. Our core customers remain cautious about their finances, and they turn to Walmart and our EDLP promise to help them manage through today's economic challenges.","The plan that Bill and his team put in place a year ago was the right plan. We churned the productivity loop, reduced expenses and invested the savings in lower prices. We listened to our customers. We added back assortment and increased in-stock. And we brought back layaway.","Together, these efforts have resulted in quarter-by-quarter improvements in traffic and sales, and the U.S. business finished the year in a solid position. You can expect us to invest even more in lower prices, and we are confident that the positive trends will continue this year.","Walmart International delivered strong growth through comp store sales and a record number of new units, including the acquisition of Massmart and Netto. It's interesting to note that with more than $125 billion in sales last year, Walmart International would clearly be among the top 3 largest retailers in the world.","Doug and his team are well-positioned to serve the expanding needs of middle income customers in high-growth markets. We are gaining share in almost every market, and I'm optimistic about growth in new regions such as Africa. The leadership teams across International remain focused on improving profitability. You'll hear more from Doug about the Powered by Walmart initiatives, which will strengthen productivity and reduce expenses in our markets.","Sam's Club comp sales had been consistently strong throughout the year. Merchandise assortment has improved in quality and value. And operational efficiencies contributed to expense leverage and a stronger member experience. Sam's also is focused on further increasing membership this year.","I'd like to appreciate Brian Cornell for his contributions. Brian developed great leaders and is leaving Sam's Club a stronger business. Rosalind Brewer jumped right into her new role as the CEO, Roz is an outstanding strategic and operational leader, and I expect Sam's Club momentum to continue.","We've also added a very talented executive to lead Global eCommerce. Neil Ashe has a strong background in interactive content; has an understanding of converting online customers, which is critical to our eCommerce growth strategy. In the last quarter, we continued to roll out new multichannel capabilities to offer the seamless experience between the store and our eCommerce platforms that customers increasingly want. We will continue to invest in the right talent and capabilities to seize the growth in Global eCommerce.","The recent leadership transitions we've made show the depth of our management bench. I believe we have one of the strongest teams in business to date, and we will continue to develop and attract the best global talent in every part of our business.","I'm excited about yesterday's announcement of our pending investment in eCommerce in China. We recognize that capital commitments, as well as investments in eCommerce, affected ROI and free cash flow for the year while we remain committed to our future growth, and investments like these position us well going forward.","Looking back at Walmart's performance, it's worth noting that in one of the most challenging economies in decades, we emerged as one of the world's strongest companies. We have continued to grow sales and earnings, and as I look forward to our 50th anniversary year, I see tremendous opportunities still ahead for our company and our shareholders. ","Let me tell you why I see so much upside. Our core Walmart U.S. business is back on track. In fact, every segment of our company is growing. Walmart's 10,000th unit, a Sam's Club, opened in Mexico in November, and by year end, our company had 10,130 units around the world and operated more than 1 billion square feet of retail space. International is our growth engine and will improve returns. Sam's Club has strong momentum. We've made significant progress in building our eCommerce capabilities, and we're continuing to lead on the social issues that matter to our customers.","We were pleased to see that this year's World Economic Forum in Davos that the issues that we're focused on, sustainable growth, sustainable agriculture and women's economic empowerment, are the same issues the world community is focused on. I want to thank our leaders and our associates for moving the next-generation Walmart forward this year for our customers and our shareholders. We have high expectations for FY '13. ","Now I'll turn over to Jeff for more financial details. Jeff?","William S. Simon","Thank you, Jeff. Last quarter, I kicked things off by getting right to the good news, and I'd like to do that again. Most of my comments will be about the fourth quarter, and then I'll summarize the full year results.","For the fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. achieved a 1.5% comp, our fourth consecutive quarter of comp improvement and our second consecutive positive quarterly comp. As Mike mentioned earlier, we also achieved our first positive traffic quarter in quite a while. January was our strongest performance in the quarter with every business unit showing strong traffic improvements versus last year's fourth quarter. All 3 geographic units delivered positive comps for the quarter as well.","We had a great holiday season. We started off with layaway services in October, spurring traffic improvements in the fourth quarter. Black Friday sales were strong, and consumers continued to respond favorably throughout Christmas and in to the new year. Our comprehensive marketing campaign helped tie it all together and drive traffic as we secured a very large share of voice with strong, creative and innovative social media initiatives.","Throughout the quarter, we implemented strategic initiatives to better serve our core customer. To put it simply, our business model is working, and we continue to drive progress on 3 major fronts:","First, our commitment to price leadership has never been stronger. As we outlined last quarter, we invested in price and reduced our gross margin by 13 basis points or about $100 million in the fourth quarter alone. We'll continue building on this initial investment in fiscal '13.","Second, our focus on expanded assortment has resonated with customers. We've completed the initial phases of our SKU add-back program, returning more than 10,000 items to the shelves. Initially, add-backs drove higher tickets as customers discovered their favorite items had returned to the shelf. In fiscal '13, we're further refining our macro space allocation for departments and categories, an effort we started last year. We're pleased with the early customer response to these changes.","Third, we'll continue to improve on-shelf availability. We now use a process involving third-party physical audits of our stores on a weekly basis. This allows us to see what customers see in their store. The program started in the first quarter and we've great progress throughout the year, improving more than 600 basis points and are now tracking in the mid-90s on a percentage range.","Now let's discuss the details of our fourth quarter performance. Net sales were $72.8 billion, an increase of 2.4% over last year. Our 1.5% comp was driven equally by both positive traffic and ticket. All of our business units delivered positive comps, with the exception of apparel, which was hampered by unseasonably warm weather.","Grocery, which includes food and consumables, continued its positive performance by delivering low single-digit positive comps. ","Our food business had positive traffic and had a mid-single-digit comp. We saw strong sales throughout the holiday season as we provided one-stop meal solutions for our customers.","We were aggressive in serving customers across the entire entertaining season, from Thanksgiving through the Super Bowl. Our bake center and meal trains in action alley provided additional holding and selling power and communicated a strong price message to customers. ","Overall comps for consumables rose sequentially each month in the quarter, benefiting from improved on-shelf availability and price investments. The investments we've made in improving our assortment have really delivered for our customers as seen by positive comps in every department.","Despite moderating inflation in certain categories, grocery prices continued to be an issue for many of our customers. For the fourth quarter, total grocery inflation was approximately 4%. However, trade down and other initiatives reduced the net inflation impact on our customers to between 100 and 200 basis points.","Our health and wellness business also performed well, delivering low single-digit positive comps. Our pharmacy prescriptions, over-the-counter and optical businesses all had positive comps.","Hardlines continued its positive performance with a low single-digit positive comp. Continued assortment initiatives, especially in sporting goods and stationery and crafts, drove sales throughout the quarter. Increased emphasis on tires drove strong sales versus last year. As other retailers have noted, unseasonably warm weather had a negative impact on cold weather-related merchandise categories.","Strong holiday performance supported by layaway and the Walmart price match guarantee helped improve the sales trend in our entertainment business by over 700 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. Black Friday drove strong sales of electronics early in the quarter and we saw an overall increase in the number of TVs sold, helping to offset the continued price deflation across the industry.","Our Straight Talk business continued to perform well as customers responded to our expanded assortment of smartphones. ","Our entertainment business, which includes electronics and toys, had a low single-digit positive comp.","Our toy business had high single-digit positive comp, benefiting from layaway during the holiday period. This performance represents approximately 900 basis points of improvement versus the fourth quarter last year. Customers utilized the service to reserve some of the season's hottest items and clearly appreciated the layaway opportunity in toys.","Our home business continued to improve over the last 4 quarters, and I'm happy to report positive low single-digit comp for the fourth quarter. This represents the first positive quarterly comp in 2.5 years. We've worked diligently to focus on the basics and improved assortment through add-backs and item merchandising. Home management and food preparation were standout categories in our home area, and outdoor living performed better than expected during the warmer weather.","Apparel had low single-digit negative comps. Sales rebounded at the end of the quarter, improving approximately 170 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. As others in the industry have reported, the warmer-than-usual weather had a big impact on cold weather apparel sales. We saw continued strength in our basics categories, indicating that our strategic focus from fashion to basics and essentials is working.","Our online business continues to grow, driven by strong sales in tablets, computers and toys. We saw increased customer activity across our various multichannel initiatives. Programs like Site to Store and Pick Up Today, which, together, generated double-digit comps during the holidays, continued to provide consumers with various shopping alternatives that are unique to our retail store footprint.","Now let's look at the financial details for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 2.4% to $72.8 billion. We invested in price in the fourth quarter. Gross margin rate was down approximately 13 basis points from last year's fourth quarter in line with our expectations. Gross profit dollars were up 1.9% to $19.6 billion.","Through operational leverage and expense management, Walmart U.S. again leveraged expenses for the quarter. Operating expenses increased 2.1% on a sales increase of 2.4% in the fourth quarter. ","Operating income grew 1.4% for the quarter to $6.1 billion due to our price investment strategy. ","At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory was up 8.5% versus last year. The primary drivers of the increase were the continued broadening of our assortment, comparisons of weather disruption to last year, food inflation and new store growth. Most of our inventory growth is in the high-turning grocery business. With our assortment strategy in place, our inventory focus will be to ensure we have the right inventory position to drive sales.","Now I'll summarize our financial results for the full year. Fiscal year '12 sales were up 1.5% to $264.2 billion. For the 52-week period, comp sales were positive 0.2%, which was a 180 basis point improvement over last year.","Gross profit dollars increased 1.4% to $72.7 billion. Gross margin was down 2 basis points, reflecting some price investment. Full year expenses increased 1% on a 1.5% sales increase. ","Operating income grew faster than sales for the year, increasing 2.2% to $20.4 billion. ","Over the course of the year, we added 119 supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions, as well as 27 small formats. For the year, we added 9.6 million square feet of space for Walmart U.S.","Supercenters remain the best vehicle to capture market share, and we remain committed to growing through new Supercenters, as well as smaller formats. The Neighborhood Market format continues to deliver above-industry results with approximately 5% comp during the fourth quarter and positive traffic throughout the year.","As I said in October, we plan to add between 14 million and 15 million square feet of retail space in fiscal year '13. These will include adding between 210 and 235 total units, which include new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. Within that total, 80 to 100 will be small formats, primarily Neighborhood Markets. We will remain efficient in our capital spending this year by lowering remodel and construction costs.","Expense reduction and improved productivity are even greater priorities for us this fiscal year. For us, leverage is not simply about cutting expenses year-over-year, but drawing from our long history of driving productivity. We've demonstrated this ability across many functional areas.","The steps our logistics team has taken have helped mitigate fuel price increases and improved supply chain efficiency. For example, we've increased associate productivity and asset utilization, which helped decrease our cost per case shipped every year for the last 5 years. During the same period, we've delivered 361 million more cases and drove 287 million fewer miles through more efficient loading and routing optimization.","In marketing, we reached even more consumers through more channels during the holidays while lowering our overall advertising expense by more than 10% for the year. Achieving these results is not always easy. It requires discipline across the organization and a shared commitment among our associates to deliver EDLP for our customers.","Finally, we continue to utilize process engineering and innovation to help us meet our leverage goals. Our aisle locator system and the integration of the electronic product code technology helps better manage inventory accuracy and contributes to on-shelf availability. Our inventory management system and innovative OneTouch freight program are having a positive impact on the business. Given our scale, when we can reduce steps and tasks, the savings add up quickly.","Fiscal year '13 is underway, and I'm pleased with our strategic plan and how customers are responding to increased assortment and lower prices. A challenging economy and rising gas prices will continue to drive customers to seek value. In the past, significant increases in gas prices over short periods of time have led to trip consolidation and higher ticket. We'll continue to help consumers adapt to such trends.","Based on our view of the economy and our core customer, we're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from January 28, 2012, through April 27, 2012, to range from flat to positive 2%. As I look back on fiscal year '12, we performed much better than a year ago, and I'm proud of our improvements. There's still a great deal to do, and I'm confident going into this year because we have a strong leadership team driving the direction and implementation of our strategy. Our assortment is back. We're operating efficiently. Our comps are positive. We're investing in price and winning back customer traffic. We're committed to being even better in fiscal year '13.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Doug for an international update.","Rosalind Gates Brewer","Thanks, Doug. It is an honor and a privilege to take on the leadership role for the Sam's Club business, and I am so impressed by this team. We just finished a great overall fourth quarter and a complete and outstanding fiscal year for Sam's Club. Our entire organization is highly motivated to continue this great momentum. Member experience survey results are at an all-time high. Our merchandising team is doing a fantastic job of finding items that members want at a great value. And the club operators are doing a great job of getting those items in front of the Sam's Club members. ","First, I'll review our Q4 results and then provide analysis on the full year. Including fuel, fourth quarter net sales were $14 billion, a 6.8% increase over last year. Gross profit increased by 4.4%. SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, increased by 26 basis points and operating income increased 7.6% to $524 million for the quarter.","Our fuel business has been strong all year, including the fourth quarter. Fuel profit was relatively flat in Q4, but overall volume was very good. Fuel prices in this year's fourth quarter were approximately 13% higher than a year ago and gallons sold were up 8%. As we have said before, we look to fuel to set the first price impression for Sam's Club. It is clearly a traffic driver for existing and potential members.","Volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. The remainder of our discussion today, therefore, is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes unless otherwise noted. ","We were very pleased with Sam's top line performance this quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $12.6 billion, up 5.4% from last year. For the 13-week period, comp sales increased by 5.4%. Combined with a 2.7% comp sales increase for the same period last year, this is an 8.1%, 13-week comp on a 2-year stacked basis. All 3 geographic operating divisions did well in the quarter with the west division turning in our strongest comp performance. Comp traffic and ticket increased for the 13-week period by 3% and 2.4%, respectively.","We completed a very successful holiday season with strong sales during Thanksgiving week and throughout December. And in January, we drove even further momentum. Our members continue to respond to our key merchandising initiatives. ","Sales by category varied with high single-digit comps in food and beverage categories and mid-single-digit comps in health and wellness categories, both key categories in our portfolio of strategy. ","Home and apparel comp sales grew mid-single digits. Investments in seasonal promotions and price deflation led to a comp sales decline in electronics.","Overall, SKU inflation across the club impacted the quarter comp by 250 to 300 basis points. Inflation continues to impact meat and selected grocery categories and, as I mentioned, deflation continues to impact electronics prices. We are very pleased to see continued unit growth in electronics year-over-year.","In fresh categories, ongoing improvement in quality and the extension of our new proprietary brand initiative, were very successful, with produce and bakery being real standouts, delivering double-digit growth. In grocery and beverage areas, driving price leadership on national brands was key to high single-digit comp growth. ","In our health and wellness business, we continue to drive awareness of our great service and low prices through a variety of communications, including the launch of our new Healthy Living Made Simple magazine. Prescription counts are growing faster than the market, and we had high single-digit comp performance in pharmacy and related areas. We introduced a new pricing structure in optical with discounts for Plus members, and that program drove both strong comps and membership upgrades. In baby, price leadership and other initiatives drove high single-digit comp growth.","In home and apparel, we are featuring favorite national brands such as Keurig coffeemakers, which led to double-digit growth in our kitchen electrics categories. ","Brands also helped drive stronger sales in basic and children's apparel. Overall apparel comps were in the low single digits. ","The improved quality and fashion of our seasonal d\u00e9cor and foods categories drove solid performance during the holiday, though toys was challenged due to the heavy discounting in the market place. We were very pleased with our profitability in these categories.","In electronics, we held market share in a very challenging price environment while managing margins effectively. We were very pleased with our unit growth in electronics this holiday season. Our sales in wireless and tablets were particularly strong with the Apple brand, a favorite. ","In short, our merchandising strategies are working very well and are driving strong momentum already in this new fiscal year. Membership and other income was up 9.1% when compared to the fourth quarter last year. We realized a financial benefit related to our profit-sharing arrangement with our credit card provider, and we grew membership income. This increase was offset by a decline in rental income. ","As we had mentioned previously, prior to this fiscal year, we rented space to a third party for a portion of our wireless business and receive rental income. We currently run this business with Sam's Club associates, and the sales and expenses of the wireless business are included directly in our operating results.","Membership income for the fourth quarter increased 2.5% versus the fourth quarter last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period rather than when it is collected. Driven by increases in both Plus upgrades and new members joining at the Plus level, our penetration of Plus members continued to grow during the fourth quarter. We saw improvement in new primary business member sign-ups, while business add-on membership remains soft.","During the fourth quarter, we launched our Sam's Club iPad app and released a significant update to our smartphone app. During the holiday season, we were pleased with the level of sales through these mobile technologies. The weeks of Thanksgiving and Christmas were the strongest weeks. Our members love the convenience and efficiency generated by these services and the majority of sales through mobile devices are from members shopping items in their local club by leveraging our Click 'n' Pull program.","Mobile support was prominent throughout all of our marketing programs. This included members being able to view items early through their mobile device during our day after Thanksgiving event. During our Holiday Taste of Sam's Club event, members could scan QR codes on the Taste and Tips station to vote for their favorite sampled items and get recipes related to those products. We are excited about these technologies and the opportunities that they provide for our members.","Net sales were strong for the fourth quarter. We managed gross margin rate well in a very competitive and inflationary pricing environment. Our gross margin rate decreased by 11 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year while gross profit dollars increased 4.6%.","Total SG&A expense increased by 4.1% for the fourth quarter. As a percentage of sales, this is an improvement of 15 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter last year. We continue to drive operational efficiencies and in the fourth quarter this year, our labor expense grew slower than the rate of sales. Sales per labor hour increased 1.1%. Our strong performance in labor expense management was partially offset by higher advertising costs versus the fourth quarter of last year.","Looking at the bottom line, our fourth quarter operating income increased to $524 million, an 8.3% increase over fourth quarter last year. At the end of the fourth quarter, inventory, including fuel inventory, was up 2% compared to last year. Overall, we're pleased with the inventory levels in our clubs and our distribution centers.","Now let me summarize our key financial highlights for fiscal year 2012. With fuel, full year net sales were $53.8 billion, up 8.8% over last year. Gross profit increased by 5.1%. SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 55 basis points, and operating income increased 9% to $1.9 billion for the year.","Looking at the results, without fuel, for the year, net sales were $47.6 billion, a 5.4% increase over last year. For the 52-week period, comp sales increased 5.1%. Comp traffic and ticket increased by 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively. Comp traffic and ticket increased for both Advantage and Business members. We continue to see members visiting our clubs more frequently throughout the year.","For the full year, membership income increased by 1.4%, and we experienced growth in Plus membership upgrades, overall renewal rates and primary member sign-ups. ","Gross profit increased by 4.7%, an 8 basis point reduction as a percentage of sales. ","Full fiscal year SG&A expense grew by 3.3%. This is an improvement of 24 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to last year. The impact of the additional interchange fees last year was 11 basis points as a percentage of sales. ","Operating income increased to $1.8 billion, a 7.9% increase over last year.","I'm looking forward to leading the Sam's team into the next fiscal year. The team already has a great strategy defined for the year and it won't surprise anyone that the member is at the center of our strategy. We're dedicated to providing the best choices for our member in terms of price and quality with an emphasis on fresh and refrigerated foods and health and wellness categories. Our operations team will ensure our members have a great experience in the clubs by continuing to optimize our staffing and by ensuring associates are well-trained.","We're also focused on leveraging technology and mobile platforms to communicate with our members and provide access to the great value Sam's Club offers, no matter how they choose to shop with us. Our partnership with the Insights team is allowing us to further define and target our merchandise offerings.","Our primary growth will come from comp sales. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from January 28, 2012, through April 27, 2012, to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, Sam's comp club sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2% for the comparable 13-week period.","Our plans also call for continued growth through new, relocated or expanded clubs. We are on schedule to open 10 to 15 units this year with up to 9 of those being new units, which is a significant increase over the 3 new units we opened in the past fiscal year. We have a great opportunity to engage new members in key markets. I'm really looking forward to seeing how much more the Sam's Club team accomplishes this year. ","Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap up and guidance. Charles?","Charles M. Holley","Thanks, Roz. We are pleased with our full year performance and especially our results for the fourth quarter. We were disciplined and focused on improving our business, and I'm happy to say that we made good progress this year, especially in the back half of the year.","We have leveraged expenses for 2 consecutive years and improved all areas of our business. Last year at this time, Walmart U.S. was in the early stages of reintroducing action alley and adding merchandise assortment and strengthening our focus on EDLP.","In a challenging economy and a highly promotional competitive environment, our U.S. businesses won in the fourth quarter and in the year. Sam's Club continued its strong sales momentum. And we believe that both Walmart and Sam's are extremely well positioned in the retail market.","International remains our growth engine. Between acquisitions and new store growth, we added record square footage and units this year. Sales were strong and we are gaining market share. We continue to be focused on the improving profitability and returns of our international operations.","We have a strong and consistent underlying business that positions us well for this year. Today, we are reiterating some our fiscal 2013 goals that we shared in October.","Net sales will grow between 5% and 7%, representing an additional $22 billion to $31 billion in sales. We expect to grow square footage by 4% to 5% this year or 45 million to 49 million square feet. Recall that we are adding units and square footage with an eye toward continued capital efficiency and reduced costs for construction and remodels. We will continue to make investments where we see we can better serve our customers and provide for returns to our shareholders.","You've heard about leverage throughout this call. It is our standard. There is no doubt that we are reducing expenses and investing in lower prices for Walmart customers. You can expect margins to decline as we put these initiatives into place. EDLP matters to our customers, and we will deliver on that mission to help them save money. We are also committed to reducing operating expenses as a percentage of sales by more than 100 basis points over the next 5 years. We have started on this effort and you heard some of those results already. Our operating segments and our Home Office support areas are working even harder on this goal this year. ","This will be accomplished by investing in technology and improving productivity in our stores. Walmart is a very efficient company, but it is always looking for new ways to standardize best practices in stores, optimize the supply chain, leveraging technology and improve associate productivity. We are constantly increasing best practices by sharing across borders, across functions and across people. More importantly, we are fast adopters of best practices to drive leverage. Some of these savings will also help increase international profitability. And as Doug noted, we plan to improve returns of our international segment.","Of course, we will remain committed to our shareholders. Walmart returned $1.2 billion and $5 billion to shareholders through dividends for the quarter and fiscal year, respectively. Combining share repurchases and dividends, Walmart returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the quarter and $11.3 billion for the fiscal year.","Mike summed it up well. Walmart is the best positioned retailer in the world. Every retailer tries to adapt to customer changes and to economic fluctuations. But the Walmart model allows our company to serve customers in ways other competitors cannot in the long run.","Looking ahead, we are cautiously optimistic that employment reports will continue to improve. However, we know that gas prices have begun to creep up again. Regardless of how the economy turns this year, Walmart will continue to lead on low prices that we know our customers depend on to live better. ","Therefore, taking into consideration the current global operating environment, we expect first quarter fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.01 and $1.06. This compares to earnings of $0.98 per share in the first quarter of last year, which included a $0.01 net benefit from multiple items.","For the full year, we are expecting earnings per share between $4.72 and $4.92. This compares to the earnings per share of $4.54, which we reported today and included $0.05 of net benefits from certain items. All earnings per share guidance assumes that currency rates remain at current levels. ","As Walmart enters our 50th year of operations, we plan on continuing the success of the previous 49 years. The company has grown from one store in Rogers, Arkansas to the great company it is today: Almost $444 billion in sales, more than 10,000 retail units around the world and more than 2 million associates serving 200 million customers every week. We are proud of our culture, the work we have done over 5 decades and the future that we have ahead of us. Walmart is a company consistently delivering an increase in sales, increase in earnings per share and strong cash flow. We remain committed to continuing this trend for our shareholders. ","Thank you for your support of our great company. Have a great day."],"21859":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.","Overall, we had a solid first quarter. Walmart generated nearly $115 billion in revenue and delivered earnings per share within our guidance range at $1.03. I\u2019ll cover the results for the quarter in just a minute, but I\u2019d like to start with an update on some of our larger strategic choices and the progress we\u2019ve made to bring them to life.","Our objective is to make changes to improve our short to mid-term performance while, at the same time, position the company for the long-term. By position, I\u2019m referring to how we set ourselves up to serve customers for years to come and the strategic choices we\u2019re making are in two critical areas, people and technology.","In April, we launched a comprehensive set of store and club initiatives that I discussed in last quarter\u2019s call. These are intended to improve our short to mid-term performance in the United States. As you\u2019ll remember, we\u2019re investing in our starting wage rates, an improved store structure, including adding department managers, and wage increases for most positions within our stores and clubs in the U.S.","We have pilots under way that will improve our scheduling process and improve our training. This set of initiatives is designed to improve the customer experience and translate into higher comp store sales over time. The rollout of these changes happens throughout this year. We know that we won\u2019t see it overnight, but we\u2019re confident these are the right things to do for our business and our team.","I\u2019ve recently visited stores and clubs in the Detroit and Seattle markets and I\u2019m encouraged with our associates\u2019 level of ownership in the business and understanding of the plan. As we improve the experience in our stores, we continue to invest to deliver a stronger mobile and e-commerce experience. In U.S. we\u2019re rolling out a more simplified checkout process on walmart.com, which is based on our global technology platform, Pangaea. An important part of this platform is that it delivers a better experience on mobile devices. Mobile is increasingly the driver of our e-commerce business.","A few weeks ago, I visited stores and clubs in Beijing and Shanghai. I really enjoyed listening to our Yihaodian customer focus group and following one of our associates around as we delivered orders to apartments in Shanghai. There are new, exciting developments happening in retail and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re in the thick of it. But, I was also reminded that the same basic tenets of our business, like value for money, a great assortment and customer service, are what they\u2019re after. Those customers we delivered to in Shanghai were quick to praise our associate in his service during deliveries. They liked our prices, but asked for items that we don\u2019t yet carry. I was pleased to hear from them that we didn\u2019t need to open the cases of merchandise because they trusted our delivery associate. That\u2019s a big deal. The week before being in China, I walked stores in Mexico and saw a growing business in grocery home shopping there, too. The associates I visited with in Mexico were sensing a momentum in their business and it was good to see them leaning forward.","So, we\u2019ll make these investments in our people, we\u2019ll give them the opportunity to move up so that they\u2019re engaged in our business and happy to serve customers. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue making progress with digital, mobile and e-commerce. And, we\u2019ll bring it all together in a seamless way that delivers value for customers. We\u2019re moving on a lot of fronts and picking up some speed. Around the world, our associates are focused on running great stores, empowering their teams, developing technological solutions to solve customer problems and integrating it all together.","Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter results in more detail. Walmart U.S. again delivered positive comp sales, and I\u2019m encouraged by the customer traffic trends. I\u2019m particularly pleased by the customer response to our Neighborhood Markets, driving strong comps again this quarter.","Based on recent surveys, we know that many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings. They\u2019re also using these funds for everyday expenses like utilities and groceries. That\u2019s where we can be their destination of choice. We\u2019re not where we want to be in every store, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress that I\u2019m seeing.","Walmart International produced solid constant currency sales growth this quarter. Mexico and Canada had really good sales results. In Mexico, the Sam\u2019s Club business is where we\u2019ve seen our most dramatic improvement, due to improved merchandise and stronger in-club operations. And one of the more encouraging signs for me is that this execution is happening over multiple store formats in Mexico, including Bodega. In China, we\u2019re doing a better job of managing inventory and building customers\u2019 trust with the quality of our fresh offering.","Sam\u2019s Club had lower comp sales and profit than expected. Membership income was up more than 7%, indicating the emphasis on winning over more members to Plus status is progressing. Sam\u2019s recently launched new services that have promise for improved member acquisition and retention, and investments in Club Pick-up and e-commerce are starting to pay off. However, we need more consistent progress, and I\u2019m confident that the strategic plan the Sam\u2019s Club team is working on will lead to longer-term improvements in our club business.","We\u2019re investing to win the future of retail, and I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that our improved e-commerce capabilities will provide. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re making progress on rolling out our global technology platform to make e-commerce and mobile shopping easier for customers. Walmart\u2019s worldwide e-commerce sales grew approximately 17% in the first quarter. Asda\u2019s this grocery home shopping continues to drive double-digit growth, and we\u2019re sharing this expertise around the world to test delivery and pickup services in more locations. To meet our growth projections, we recently announced a new fulfillment center in Brazil, which will be our second one there dedicated solely to e-commerce. We will open two new mechanized fulfillment centers this quarter in the U.S. and two others will follow later this year.","At Walmart, we operate our business in a way that adds value to communities. We recently published our annual Global Responsibility Report. I\u2019d love for you to take a look at our ongoing initiatives to create economic opportunity for our associates and others in the retail industry; to enhance the sustainability of our operations and product supply chain; and to strengthen communities in the places where we operate. It\u2019s real and meaningful work, and something we\u2019re really proud of.","On Friday, June 5th, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting. It\u2019s always a great opportunity to hear from our shareholders and interact with so many of our more than 5,000 associates who come from our markets around the world. I always leave this meeting energized after spending time with our associates.","Looking ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making and the plans in place for the future. Our priority is to drive growth across the enterprise. Globally, we\u2019re working to exceed customer expectations by helping them save time and money and have a great experience as they interact with us in store, online or on their phone. We\u2019ve made progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re pushing to change faster as we continue down the right path to deliver long-term value to both customers and shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot","Thanks, Doug. Today, I\u2019ll highlight some items in the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Further details are available in the accompanying presentation posted today with this transcript.","For the first quarter of fiscal \u201816, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Walmart EPS were $1.03. This compares to last year\u2019s EPS of $1.10, which was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 from severe weather. Currency exchange rate fluctuations had a greater than anticipated impact on this year\u2019s first quarter results. Fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3.3 billion, and similarly impacted EPS by $0.03. As a reminder, our incremental investment in e-commerce was approximately $0.02 per share, and the investment in U.S. associates impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. These investments were also the primary contributor to the 2.8% increase in consolidated operating expenses.","Additionally, FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $33 million, comprised of $25 million for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and $8 million for our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Last year, FCPA and compliance-related costs were $53 million in the first quarter.","The company\u2019s consolidated operating income decreased 8.3%. Excluding the impact from currency, operating income decreased 6.1%. The company\u2019s continued investments in e-commerce, as well as wages and training for our U.S. associates, were headwinds on our operating income during the quarter. As you will see on slide two, net interest expense increased 45.1%, primarily due to the cumulative impact of an immaterial accounting correction that I will explain in a moment. Without this cumulative adjustment, interest expense would have been flat.","We consolidate a number of entities into our financial statements for which there are minority, or non-controlling, interests. In one of these entities in Canada, we determined that certain historical sales of properties did not qualify for sale accounting, due to the company\u2019s continuing involvement in the sold properties. As a result, under U.S. GAAP, these properties should have remained in our financial statement as assets, with a corresponding financial obligation recorded equal to the properties\u2019 sales proceeds. The assets and financial obligation are amortized over time.","During the first quarter, we recorded the correction to our balance sheet to increase assets by $1.1 billion and liabilities by $1.4 billion. With respect to the income statement, the correction included $254 million of cumulative interest expense, offset by a related tax benefit of $53 million, and $173 million attributable to non-controlling interest. The correction had a de minimis impact on our operating income and on earnings per share, as EPS is based on income attributable to Walmart.","From the balance sheet perspective, consolidated inventory increased 2.2%. Later in today\u2019s call, you\u2019ll hear more about inventory from our segment leaders. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.4%, which compares to 80.2% last year. Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2015 was 16.6%, which compares to 16.7% last year. The slight change in ROI was primarily due to continued investments in store growth and e-commerce initiatives, offset by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The decrease in free cash flow was due to lower income from continuing operations and impact of timing of payments for inventory, as well as timing of income tax payments.","The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is share repurchases. The company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares for $280 million during the quarter. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influenced our share repurchase activity. We have approximately $10 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. Greg?","Greg Foran","Thank you, Claire. Back on April the 1st in New York, we provided an update on the Walmart U.S. business. We discussed what was working well, and what needed improvement in order to meet, both the expectations of customers and the goals of the company. We laid out a multi-year plan that includes several large and specific projects, all of which fit within our broader strategic focus on assortment, price, access, and customer experience. As we discussed, we\u2019re not only interested in reaching our goals, but reaching them in a way which is sustainable for the long-term. This requires a steady execution, a pace that is fast but calculated, and one that allows us to get it right.","This quarter we began executing this plan. We took the initial steps in April towards a stronger investment in our associates by raising the minimum starting wage for all hourly associates to $9 per hour. As a part of our $1 billion investment in our associates, we also raised the floor and ceiling on pay bands in our stores, creating raises for many full and part-time hourly associates at every level. More than 500,000 associates benefited from this change. We\u2019re also restructuring the management teams in the stores, adding back almost 8,000 department managers. These department managers will have responsibility for a smaller area of the store ensuring that they have the knowledge and the time to engage with both the customers and store associates driving an overall better experience. The $1 billion investment in our associates this year includes training programs as well.","Also included in our wage investments we\u2019ve continued our Checkout Promise initiative we began over the holidays ensuring more registers are open during peak times to drive a fast and friendly experience as customers are completing their shopping trips. Finally, we continued to make steady progress against the other initiatives we\u2019ve discussed, including our urgent agenda items, assortment discipline, pricing, and in-stock goals. These actions require a significant investment, which is included in our financial plan for the year. It\u2019s an investment we believe is imperative to providing customers with the unparalleled shopping experience they expect and deserve, and our associates with more opportunities to build a successful career at Walmart.","With these steps in mind, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter results. Net sales grew $2.4 billion, or 3.5%, versus last year. For the 13-week period ended May 1st, comparable stores were up 1.1%, which was within our guidance. Comp sales were driven by solid growth in traffic, which was up 1%. Customers continue to see the benefit of lower gas prices versus last year and are responding favorably to some of our new assortments for the spring and summer selling seasons.","All formats had positive comps for the quarter, including our traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, which posted approximately a 7.9% comp. A focus on customer service and in-stock position drove strong traffic in this format. Customers continue to see the benefit of Neighborhood Markets to meet their everyday needs, including convenient access to services such as drive-through pharmacies and fuel stations.","Merchandise comp performance was similar to last quarter. Customers responded to the new spring and summer assortments in apparel and continued growth in active wear and strong brands across the category helped meet customers\u2019 assortment needs. Indoor home categories with key items and investments in opening price points drove momentum. We also saw customers transition outside driving sales in outdoor, lawn and garden, and toys. Last, health and wellness posted strong comp sales with momentum in both OTC and optical driven by recent product launches, as well as continued growth in pharmacy scripts.","Within general merchandise, we continued to feel pressure in media and electronics, resulting from industry contraction, the shift from physical to digital media, and lapping last year\u2019s release of the movie Frozen. Additionally, in-stock positions in categories such as TVs suffered as a result of the port congestion on the West Coast. That said we now believe the majority of this disruption is behind us.","Moving to grocery, we were pleased by the operational improvement we saw in fresh. As we mentioned in April, this is a key area of focus, and getting fresh right is critical to the customer experience. We\u2019re taking the right steps towards reducing the time to bring fresh product to our customers, and training associates to ensure the best offering is on the shelf. We still have a lot more to do in this area, but we\u2019re steadily improving. One key headwind we faced in grocery during the first quarter was moderating inflation in meat, and deflation in both dairy and produce. While partially offset by inflationary trends in dry and frozen foods, we estimate the moderation in fresh foods impacted our overall comp performance by almost 70 basis points this quarter. Overall, net food inflation negatively impacted our comp by approximately 20 basis points.","Finally, e-commerce, driven by strong traffic and price leadership, saw double-digit comp growth across many departments. E-commerce plays a key role in our focus on access for the customer, which is fundamentally around convenience. We\u2019re launching the final phase of our new platform related to cart and online checkout capabilities. Our customers are using their mobile devices to access our site on the go. Mobile traffic was up over 100% for the quarter, and we saw higher conversion rates as well. We continue to learn from our grocery home shopping tests where we recently added another location to the Huntsville, Alabama market. And, we\u2019re working towards a better customer experience in our Walmart Pickup program formerly called Site to Store. The program includes improved email communication, a new signage package that makes it easier for customers to understand the program, and a focus on a faster pickup experience in the stores. It will roll out to all stores by October 1st. For the quarter, e-commerce sales contributed approximately 20 basis points to our overall comp performance.","Moving on to the remainder of our financial results. In the first quarter, gross profit rate declined 13 basis points, driven primarily by a headwind from shrink, half of which was in food. We are addressing this increase immediately, bringing a high level of focus and visibility to this concern by adding it as a key urgent agenda item this year. In addition to shrink, the ongoing mix shift in pharmacy, incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion, and cost inflation in consumables contributed to the decline. Somewhat offsetting this was a continued focus on the urgent agenda items laid out last year, including managing throwaways in fresh and reducing inventory that is no longer active in the stores.","As expected, operating expenses increased 6.6% versus last year. This was driven by changes in estimates associated with our incentive accrual versus last year and the investments we\u2019re making in our associates, including the increase in minimum starting pay rates, the restructure of store management roles, and the continuation of our Checkout Promise initiative. Finally, ongoing investments in e-commerce and technology were a headwind to the quarter. Given these investments, along with the reduction in gross profit rate, operating income declined 6.8% or $336 million for the quarter.","Inventory grew 5.4% in the first quarter. Almost half of this growth was related to the significant number of new stores added in the past several months. The remainder of the growth was related to congestion clearing in the West Coast ports, and some conscious replenishment decisions we made to drive improvements in our in-stock position. We continue to make strides against our goal of strong working capital management. We grew inventory in comp stores below the rate of sales, and our in-stock position continued to improve throughout the quarter.","This quarter, we opened 20 supercenters, including relocations and expansions. Additionally, we opened 15 traditional-format Neighborhood Markets, and 9 smaller-format locations, including one campus store location.","We\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the past several months truly understanding what it will take to succeed over time in a rapidly-changing retail environment. This quarter, we made some improvements, taking the right steps at a steady pace, ensuring we stay on track towards the long-term goals of the business. We continue to monitor our fast, friendly, and clean performance in the stores, and based on customer feedback, we are making good progress.","I\u2019m out walking our stores every week, visiting our associates and talking to our customers in markets across the country. Additionally, Judith McKenna, our Chief Operating Officer, has visited with over 750 store managers in recent weeks, gathering their thoughts on how we can improve. We are pleased that our customer service scores have steadily increased this quarter with all geographic areas and formats showing positive results. We know, though, that we\u2019re not where we want to be yet. It will take time to achieve our goals, but we\u2019re fully committed to providing our customers with a shopping experience they can love, and associates who see their efforts leading to broader and better careers.","For the second quarter, we expect traffic to remain strong supported by sustained low gas prices and our efforts to improve customer service in our stores. This will be offset, in part, by a continued decline in food inflation rates. For the 13-week period ending July 31, we anticipate a comp sales increase of around 1%. Last year, our comp sales for the period were flat.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an update on Walmart International. Dave?","Dave Cheesewright","Thank you, Greg. Over the past few months, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit the majority of our markets, and I continue to be pleased with the progress I see. Overall, we\u2019ve had a solid start to the fiscal year financially and continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities. As a reminder, these key priorities include, actively managing the existing portfolio; driving comp sales; accelerating e-commerce; delivering market priorities, particularly in China, Brazil and Mexico; and finally, strengthening key enablers such as being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust.","Before we discuss the financials, here are a few highlights from the first quarter. First, I\u2019m particularly pleased with our overall performance in Mexico, which not only had its strongest net quarterly sales growth in over two years, but also grew operating income faster than sales. Our results in Mexico were due to better comps in all key formats, including Sam\u2019s Club. Also, I want to call out our performance in Canada, which had a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition to Canada and Mexico, we achieved comp growth in most of our other markets, as we remain committed to delivering positive comp sales across the board.","I\u2019m energized by the execution I\u2019ve seen from our teams. In addition, I\u2019m excited about our efforts in accelerating e-commerce. In the UK, grocery home shopping continues to report double-digit comps, and we\u2019re leveraging our UK experience in other markets across the globe. Earlier, Doug mentioned some of our change initiatives that we\u2019re working on across the enterprise. One of these initiatives is built around this experience in grocery home shopping. We have a newly created International Acceleration Team based in the UK that is building close partnerships with our markets to speed up the adoption of grocery home shopping processes and technologies. We\u2019re now working towards a common technology platform to better position us for the expansion of grocery home shopping.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at our first quarter results. In the first quarter, net sales grew 3.4% on a constant currency basis, partially benefitting by the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter. The U.S. dollar has remained at historically high levels, leading to a considerable currency impact of $3.3 billion, which led to a 6.6% sales decline on a reported basis. Comp sales were favorable across four of our five top markets, with the UK driven by continued deflation in food and aggressive competition, being the exception. We also had negative comps in Japan, lapping last year\u2019s benefit of accelerated consumer spending ahead of the April 2014 consumption tax hike. We grew comp sales in our remaining markets. As expected, operating income grew slower than sales at 0.1% on a constant currency basis, impacted by planned strategic investments in our e-commerce businesses and ongoing economic and competitive pressures in certain markets. With the currency exchange impact, operating income decreased 11% on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 8.2%, driven by slower sales in the UK and inventory build-up leading up to the Easter holiday. On a reported basis, inventory declined 5.4%.","Now let\u2019s discuss individual results for our largest markets. Comp sales and changes in various metrics are presented on a constant currency basis only. In all countries except Brazil and China, financial results are inclusive of e-commerce. Slides eight and nine of the presentation summarize financial details.","Let\u2019s start with the UK. The market remained highly competitive and promotional. Hard discounters continued to gain share, though at a slowing rate, and all major supermarkets stepped up aggressive investments in price. As a result, grocery deflation persisted at record levels, leading to low market growth. Grocery prices were down 2% versus last year for the 12 weeks ended March 29, according to Kantar.","UK sales declined 2.9% and comp sales declined 3.3% excluding fuel, primarily driven by deflation in fresh. Operating income declined, negatively impacted by lower sales and margin. Heading into Q2, the team is focused on improving sales and operating performance through price investments in branded goods, maintaining aggressive price points on key items, and continuing to invest in the highest quality fresh offering. Asda\u2019s five-year strategy of investing \u00a31 billion in lowering prices remains on track this year, our second year of the program.","In Canada, we maintained solid growth amid a dynamic, competitive environment. Sales were up 3.7%, and comps were up 1.8%, driven by solid Easter sales, strong performance in seasonal and improving strength in our overall food business, including fresh. We continue to enhance our value and price offering, especially with private brands, where we saw significant growth. Market share increased in food, health and wellness, consumables, and infant categories, for the 12 weeks ended April 18, according to Nielsen.","Operating income grew faster than sales for the quarter. We remain focused on our low cost operating model and continue to seek out opportunities to drive efficiencies to reduce expenses. I\u2019m pleased with performance overall and expect the positive trend to continue, as the competitive landscape evolves.","On May the 8th, we announced the acquisition of 13 stores, 12 leased and one owned, and one distribution center from a former competitor. While these transactions are subject to bankruptcy court approval, we look forward to bringing additional supercentres to more provinces in Canada. These stores are in addition to the 29 supercentres we announced as part of our current fiscal year expansion program.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Mexico, which released their earnings on April the 21st. Please note that the Walmex release is under IFRS and the results here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ.","Consolidated Walmex net sales increased 7.3%, with strong comp sales in both Mexico and Central America. Operating income growth was also favorable, up 10.4% year-over-year. Mexico net sales grew 7.1% and comp sales increased 4.9%. Self-service gained 80 basis points of market share during the quarter, according to ANTAD. Performance was strong in food and consumables, the largest contributor to the comp sales momentum. Sam\u2019s Club comp sales grew 6.8% in the quarter, benefitted by improved merchandise assortment and initiatives to grow the membership base. I\u2019m excited about the momentum and outlook, as the team continues to launch initiatives and price investments that will resonate with the customer. In addition to top line performance, Mexico did a good job managing expenses, delivering over 30 basis points of leverage compared to last year, driven by lower utility, supplies, and advertising expenses.","Now, on to Brazil, market conditions worsened this quarter due to continued inflationary cost pressures. In addition, the retail grocery sector had its worst first quarter growth in the last six years at 2.2%, according to Serasa Experian, a global information services company. Despite the continuing economic slowdown, I was pleased to see another quarter of steady growth in Brazil. Both net sales and comp sales were up 3.0%. Sam\u2019s Club and Maxxi formats outpaced retail market growth, with double-digit comp sales increases. Brazil continues to invest in price, particularly in general merchandise, in an effort to improve sales trends in retail formats.","Brazil did not leverage expenses for the quarter, largely due to the inflationary pressures that I\u2019ve just mentioned. Management remains focused on turnaround initiatives to deliver profitability in the back half of the year.","Moving on to China, Walmart China\u2019s Q1 net sales grew 1.9% and comp sales grew 0.4%, as sales for Chinese New Year improved year-over-year. Recall that Chinese New Year was January the 31st last year and February the 19th this year, so some sales shifted from Q4 into Q1 this year. According to China UnionPay Data, our gift card loading outperformed the market in the high volume months of January and February. Nielsen also showed that Walmart increased market share in fast moving consumer goods in the hypermarket channel, and maintained share in the Modern Trade channel, which includes smaller format stores, for the 12-weeks ended March 29.","While there are ongoing market headwinds from government austerity and slightly slower economic growth, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to deliver growth in China. Part of this growth will come from the planned opening of 33 stores and clubs this year, with expansion focused in the southern regions where we have strong market presence. Additionally, we aim to provide better services and widen our customer reach through greater expansion of our omni-channel platforms, including online and mobile. We\u2019re focused on driving efficiency, cost reductions and strengthening our portfolio in China. Operating income grew 23.5%, up due to expense leverage and gross margin improvement from higher sell-through with Chinese New Year. We leveraged expenses this quarter in our core business through \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d and \u201cWe Buy for Less\u201d initiatives and will continue to pass those savings onto customers.","Finally, let\u2019s discuss e-commerce performance. Accelerating e-commerce is one of our strategic objectives this year, and we\u2019re making significant strides in providing convenient access for shoppers as we continue to invest globally in e-commerce capabilities. In Mexico, we\u2019re launching an improved Sam\u2019s Club website in the second quarter and an app in the third quarter. In China, we\u2019ll launch a new app later this quarter for our stores that will enable customers to shop from their local Walmart store and choose to pick up their order in store or have it delivered to home. And in Canada, our e-commerce business continues to perform strongly with a comp of greater than 40%.","Yihaodian, our e-commerce business in China, benefited from the Spring Festival promotion to support Chinese New Year, with strong sales of imported items in milk products, shampoo, and other categories. Orders drove most of our growth and our conversion rate improved nearly 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Mobile contributed more than 40% of orders.","Brazil e-commerce had another strong performance this quarter, with comps up double digits and outpaced the Brazilian total e-commerce market growth rate. Phones, auto and tires, and baby categories helped drive this growth. Above average summer temperatures drove strong sales in fans and air conditioners. On Consumer Day, a national event in March that\u2019s similar to a Black Friday event in the U.S. we also delivered strong sales growth.","In addition to our solid financial performance, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in strengthening our key enablers of being the lowest cost operator, building world-class talent, and building trust. One way we deliver on being the lowest cost operator is by reducing our total energy required to power our buildings. For example, in the UK, we\u2019re migrating to a new energy monitoring system that provides daily energy alarms, analytic capabilities and reporting.","In addition, we remain committed to programs that develop talent. We began providing retail training to women in emerging markets last year and have now trained women in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, and India, and are focused on scaling projects throughout this year. By the end of next year, we plan to have trained 200,000 women for their first jobs in retail in our emerging markets.","As we look forward to the rest of the year for the International business, we anticipate some headwinds, particularly in Latin America, where in the second quarter we lap last year\u2019s World Cup. We also expect similar trends in the UK to continue given market conditions, and anticipate ongoing currency pressure with the strength of the U.S. dollar. At the same time, though, we have strong momentum in markets like Mexico and Canada, and expect to see solid growth continue in these markets. The global landscape remains challenging and the retail industry is highly competitive. However, I believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction and are making progress towards our strategic objectives, which is setting us up for long-term growth and success.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thank you, Dave. Our first quarter results were disappointing, as comp sales missed guidance, and we delivered softer net sales and profit than last year. We continued to invest in our initiatives to drive growth, and while we made progress in some areas, we still have upside opportunity in others. This year is one of investment and testing, and we\u2019re very focused on strengthening our foundation for business improvement in the longer-term.","We\u2019ve been focused on four initiatives designed to improve our foundation. The first initiative is improving our merchandise assortment, where we are driving newness and differentiation. For example, we increased our organic offerings by 20% since the beginning of the year, and these are important to various demographic groups, including millennials.","Our second initiative is focused on membership and decision sciences. We created a new Chief Member Officer, reporting to me, that will own membership data and analytics. This role, which was put in place at the beginning of the quarter, oversees a new team of data scientists, marketing and insights professionals. I\u2019m pleased that the team\u2019s recent new targeted membership efforts give us optimism for the rest of the year.","Our third initiative is launching new programs to enhance member value. One example is a groundbreaking new pharmacy program called \u201cFree\/4\/10,\u201d which provides Plus members with free or discounted prescriptions for five costly diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, mental health, vitamin D deficiency, and prostate health. This program contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout.","Our fourth initiative is a significant long-term investment in our e-commerce business. We re-launched Club Pickup in every club in the country, resulting in a 37% sales increase in the Club Pickup Program. Members love the convenience benefits of online ordering and easy pickup at the club. I am encouraged that our investments will pay off in the near future.","Now, on to the numbers. With fuel, operating income declined 10.9% to $427 million. The fuel business has experienced significant pricing volatility within the quarter, and as a result, our fuel business lost $9 million this quarter. For additional results with fuel, please reference the accompanying presentation.","In Q1, net sales, without fuel, grew 1.2% to $12.4 billion. Comp sales were 0.4%, driven by ticket increases of 60 basis points and by a traffic decline of 20 basis points. Savings member traffic was positive, offset by a decline in business member traffic. E-commerce contributed 40 basis points to the comp for the 13-week period. Our gross profit rate declined 15 basis points compared to last year, attributable to our investment in Plus Cash Rewards. We will continue to invest in Cash Rewards as Plus penetration grows.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 33 basis points, due to investments in new clubs, e-commerce, and technology. Membership and other income grew 4.9%, with membership income up 7.4%. Operating income declined 8.6% to $436 million.","Our merchant teams continue to work on bringing newness and trend-right merchandise into the clubs. We still have opportunities for improvement, and we continue to invest in price to drive value for our members. Comp sales in fresh, freezer, cooler were up in the low single-digits. Meat and deli categories performed well, but our overall food comps, including dairy and produce, were impacted by deflation in these fresh categories. We grew comp sales in dry grocery. This is an area in which we will continue to invest to improve both assortment and member value.","Consumables were led by private brand table top programs, offset by ongoing supply issues within baby care. Overall, home and apparel comps were up in the low single-digits. Women and children\u2019s apparel was strong, delivering double-digit comp performance. Patio and seasonal items were down, due to the slow start to spring in key geographies, but mattress and houseware categories grew double-digits in comp sales.","In our technology and entertainment business, comp sales were down. TV sales were challenged due to the West Coast port delays, but did pick up later in the quarter once the delays decreased. Our audio sales were strong due to new headphones and soundbars. This category has been part of our initiative to streamline our offering to provide the latest advancements in the technologies that matter and to improve our offerings online.","Our health and wellness category benefited from our pharmacy\u2019s introduction of the newly launched Free\/4\/10 program that I mentioned earlier. This program is being merchandised at our pharmacies and contributed to a number of Plus upgrades since its rollout. We are optimistic about its ability to continue to drive membership growth. As we continue to enhance and improve our offerings, we are managing our inventory appropriately. Inventory, without fuel, grew 1.9%, primarily attributable to new clubs. Beyond these merchandise areas, membership growth is our number one priority, and we see opportunities to better serve both the Business and the Savings member.","Turning to membership, we were encouraged by the momentum in April in both acquisition and renewal counts. This will be a constant focus for us. We see consistent growth in our Plus membership, driven by our national rollout of Cash Rewards last year. We have added over 1.6 million new Plus members since a year ago. Members that have upgraded to a Plus membership are highly engaged, both in clubs and online, and their spending is up over the previous year in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, the 5-3-1 MasterCard program we launched last year continues to receive industry accolades, but more importantly, receives tremendously positive feedback from our members.","When I\u2019m out walking in the clubs and talking with members, they consistently tell me how much they enjoy the benefits of our Cash Rewards program, and our 5-3-1 MasterCard. This is especially true for our small business members as the rewards really add up. Together, these two initiatives continue to meet our expectations in providing membership value.","For the long term, we continue to see success in some key strategic areas and will build on these. The integration of digital and physical is a key enabler for our growth. E-commerce delivered a double-digit comp this quarter, contributing 40 basis points to the segment comp. Growth in traffic, ticket, and conversion was driven by strong double-digit Club Pickup comps. We are also leveraging our digital capabilities to drive targeted member growth and renewal. Utilizing our data analytics, we used digital media to reach current and prospective members, but can now align it with system enhancements and better visibility of members\u2019 shopping behaviors. For example, our recent Groupon offer clearly communicated the value of the Sam\u2019s Club membership card and generated more than 220,000 new members in less than two weeks.","Ultimately, we know we will attract and retain members by creating irresistible value in our membership. While our business member numbers continue to be challenged, we\u2019re maintaining our focus on turning that trend around. To help them grow, we\u2019ve expanded the value we provide to small business members with the addition in the first quarter of five new or enhanced services through third-parties, identity theft protection; accounting; business lending; payment processing; and online marketing.","With these new services, we\u2019ve broadened the portfolio of new business services we launched in the fall, and we will continue to do so throughout the year. The primary purpose of these services is to help our small business members be successful, and create additional membership value from their Sam\u2019s Club card. Although it\u2019s still early, we\u2019ve had positive feedback on our new services.","We are intensely focused on addressing top line sales and membership. We expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending July 31 to be between flat and up 2%.","Now, I\u2019ll pass it over to Charles. Charles?","Charles Holley","Thanks, Roz. I will wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on our performance. As you heard, currency exchange negatively impacted our sales by $3.3 billion and earnings per share by $0.03, which was more than we anticipated. Even though our Walmart U.S. comp sales were around the bottom of our guidance, we are pleased with our earnings per share coming in at $1.03, in the middle of our range.","Before I move on to our second quarter guidance, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we continue to execute our enterprise strategy, which we feel is creating a stronger foundation for the future. It\u2019s still early days, but it\u2019s important to note, we are managing our capital in a very disciplined way, seeking the right balance between sales growth and profitability as we integrate digital and physical. Based on our views of the global macro-economic environment, and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings per share to range between $1.06 and $1.18.","Our second quarter guidance includes the impact of approximately $0.04 per share from our previously announced investments in both associate wages and training, as well as $0.04 per share from currency.","Now as a reminder, our full year earnings per share guidance assumes the impact of approximately $0.20 per share from our strategic investments in both associate wages and training, as well as an incremental $0.06 to $0.09 per share in e-commerce investment. In our first quarter, we incurred approximately $0.02 per share from our investment in associate wages and training and an incremental $0.02 per share from our e-commerce investments.","In addition to the impact from these two significant investments, we expect currency to remain a significant headwind for the year. Assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on full year net sales would be approximately $14 billion. Now, this compares to our guidance in February of approximately $10 billion. Again, assuming exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact on our earnings per share this year would be approximately $0.13 per share, compared to our prior guidance of $0.10 per share.","We continue to expect our effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34% for this fiscal year. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. And in any given quarter, our effective tax rate could be higher or lower than the full year range. In February, we indicated that we expected our first quarter effective tax rate to be the highest of all four quarters this year. However, given the fluctuations that I just mentioned, we were below that initial forecast.","Before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. In this fiscal year, we added approximately 4.1 million additional square feet of retail space around the world.","Additionally, when there are opportunities that can increase our ability to serve customers and add shareholder value, we will invest beyond our capital plan that we shared in October. Our recent announcement in Canada regarding the acquisition and renovation of specific real estate locations from a competitor for approximately $290 million is a great example of such an opportunity. Our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.","Before I close, I would like to reiterate that working capital management remains a very high priority for us. We acknowledge there\u2019s more work to do across our business, but our leadership teams are committed to further improvement throughout this year.","With that, thank you for your support of our company. We hope to see all of you at Shareholders this year.","Unidentified Company Representative","This call included certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.

Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under the section called financial reporting. One additional item I would like to highlight is that beginning this quarter we will provide results and commentary primarily on our 5 largest international markets, all of which had revenue in excess of $10 billion in fiscal 2014.","As a reminder, for fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar. For this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based on 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with the 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website. Our Q1 reporting period ran from Feb. 1 through May 2, 2014, so our reported comp results this year are one week later than last year.","Beginning this fiscal year for Walmart U.S., we will report comp sales performance based on how we currently manage the merchandise areas, rather than the six categories we have previously described.

And then, Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with his perspective on our financial performance, and as always, he\u2019ll cover guidance.","Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.","Walmart\u2019s first quarter consolidated net sales increased to more than $850 million or 0.8% over last year. Like other retailers in the United States, the unseasonably cold and disruptive winter weather negatively impacted our U.S. sales and drove operating expenses higher than expected for the company. This, coupled with the higher than anticipated tax rate, resulted in earnings per share of $1.10.","Our underlying business is solid, and I\u2019m confident in the company\u2019s long-term strategies. We\u2019re making progress on building a more customer-centric organization, with a foundation of everyday low prices. We\u2019re investing in technology and our multi-format portfolio to bring Walmart\u2019s value proposition to many more customers around the world. We have a tremendous opportunity to win with the integration of digital and physical retail, as customers have the resources from us to shop on their terms.","Walmart U.S. added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales compared to last year. We delivered on our comp guidance despite the impact from severe weather several times during the quarter. Our sales increased during the back half of the quarter. Neighborhood Markets delivered approximately a 5% comp. This strong and consistent performance is exciting, as we accelerate their rollout this year to complement our core supercenter fleet. Of course, we always have room for improvement. We continue to focus on our execution, both in-store and online, to provide customers with the merchandise and the shopping experience they desire.","Sam\u2019s Club had a tough quarter, with lower sales than anticipated. Membership income increased, driven primarily by last year\u2019s fee increase. I\u2019m encouraged by the work underway to elevate the merchandise assortment to highlight newness and drive sales. We\u2019re also launching new services next month to make a Sam\u2019s Club membership more rewarding.","A bright spot this quarter was the performance of Walmart International. Net sales increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m optimistic because of the improved sales trends, and the progress we continue to make on operational efficiencies. I was really pleased with our International segment\u2019s more than 5% growth in constant currency operating income this quarter.","As we focus on customer relevance, I\u2019m excited about the progress that we\u2019re making on our e-commerce initiatives. We will create transformative growth through these capabilities. Our investments are focused on improving customer experience and fulfillment capacity to provide the options that customers expect.","While I was in the U.K. last month, I saw how we\u2019re innovating to win the integration of digital and physical retail. Our team in the U.K. continues to expand convenient access to the merchandise customers want \u2013 from multiple pick-up points to grocery home delivery.","Shortly after I returned from the U.K., I flew to Denver to see our \u201cWalmart to Go\u201d grocery delivery and pick-up operations. It\u2019s really impressive how our e-commerce and store teams are collaborating to deliver for our customers in ways they want to be served. We\u2019re sharing global best practices across our markets to serve customers","more effectively.","There are a lot of good things happening in e-commerce across the globe. In the first quarter, we grew sales approximately 27%. We\u2019re seeing double-digit sales growth from nearly all of our e-commerce and mobile commerce businesses around the world. Brazil e-commerce and Yihaodian in China continue to experience strong demand.","I just returned from China on Friday and was excited to see our Yihaodian team and see some of the new ideas they\u2019re working on. We\u2019re also making great progress on our global technology platform, Pangaea, and we\u2019re confident that customers will appreciate the streamlined functionality it will provide when we begin its rollout later this year. The lines between digital and physical retail have blurred and this is all ultimately about meeting and then exceeding customer expectations.","At Walmart, we welcome the opportunity to lead on sustainability, but we believe that all retailers, regardless of platform or presence, have a responsibility to invest in this area. Last month, we hosted our first Sustainable Product Expo, bringing together many of the key thought leaders on this topic. And, it was an honor to join the CEOs from a number of our key supplier partners in committing to promote initiatives that advance sustainable agriculture and ramp up recycling programs in U.S. cities.","On June 6, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, and it\u2019s great to hear from our shareholders. I also look forward to seeing so many of our associates who come from our markets around the world. I appreciate their dedication to our purpose, and I\u2019m inspired by their commitment to save our customers money and time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing to enable and empower our associates with the skills necessary to compete and providing them with the opportunity of a career with upward mobility.","Looking ahead, we continue to concentrate on driving growth across the enterprise. We\u2019re laser-focused on delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our merchandising efforts, price leadership and service.","Capital efficiency continues to be a priority, as we invest in our store fleet and our global supply chain. Also, as you\u2019ve seen with our 12 e-commerce acquisitions over the last 3 years, we intend to be aggressive in adding e-commerce and mobile commerce capabilities, such as the purchase of Adchemy earlier this month. As we view our business through the eyes of our customers, we\u2019re working to deliver a relevant, personalized and seamless customer experience across all channels to further grow sales.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot ","Thank you, Doug.","Today, I\u2019d like to highlight items affecting the company\u2019s consolidated financial results for the first quarter and provide a bit of color around certain other items. Additional details from a consolidated perspective are available for reference in the accompanying presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4.","Severe weather in our U.S. businesses negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03. Additionally, the company\u2019s effective tax rate for the quarter was higher than anticipated in the full-year guidance we provided on February 20. We continue to believe our full-year tax rate will range between 32% and 34%. We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate, as it may be impacted by a number of factors.","The impact of currency fluctuations continued to weigh on our results, negatively impacting net sales by $1.6 billion. As you can see on slide 2, consolidated net sales increased more than $850 million, or 0.8%. Excluding the currency impact, net sales would have increased 2.1%.","Let\u2019s move on to operating expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which include core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services, increased 12.4%. As we take a closer look at the components, core corporate expenses increased 5.4%. FCPA and compliance-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $53 million.","Approximately $34 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, and approximately $19 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. The growth in e-commerce support was driven by our investments to help expand our global technology platform to deliver an unparalleled customer experience.","Our leverage services area includes investments we are making in technology, such as back office capabilities and risk and compliance management. In addition, we continue to invest in SAP to support our core operating segments, including productivity initiatives.","Net interest expense increased 7.2%. The strength of our balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage. We took the opportunity to participate in the historically low interest rate environment, issuing $4.6 billion in new debt during the quarter. We anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year.","Consolidated inventory increased 5%. The timing of Easter from the first quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year impacted inventory balances in many of our non-U.S. markets. You will hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments.","Payables as a percentage of inventory were 80.2%, which compares to 85.2% last year, due to the timing of payments and higher inventory balances, including the timing of Easter. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority.","Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2014 was 16.7%, compared to 17.8% last year. ROI was impacted by a decrease in operating income, as well as investments in fixed assets. The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to timing of income tax payments and lower capital expenditure for the quarter.","The last item I\u2019ll leave you with today is related to share repurchases. In the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $626 million. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity.","As we examine the level of share repurchases for the first quarter, it\u2019s important to remember that in addition to our normal activity, the company also spent approximately $1.5 billion to purchase substantially all of the remaining outstanding shares of Walmart Chile.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","Bill Simon","Thank you, Claire.","For the first quarter, we added approximately $1.3 billion in net sales, with relatively flat comp sales. As we indicated in February, we realized negative comp sales during the first two weeks of the fiscal year from severe winter storms. A solid start to the spring season and a strong Easter holiday drove positive comps over the remaining 11 weeks of the quarter; that\u2019s despite additional severe weather and about 50 basis points of continued SNAP-related headwind. Weather impacted Q1 comp sales by approximately 20 basis points. Overall, our comp sales were down 8 basis points, in line with our guidance.","I\u2019m encouraged by the sales momentum in the back half of the quarter and with approximately 30 basis points of improvement in our comp versus Q4. I\u2019m also pleased we gained 23 basis points in market share across the key categories of \u201cfood, consumables & OTC\u201d for the 13 weeks ended April 26, 2014, according to The Nielsen Company. The entire team was focused on driving sales, launching multiple innovative initiatives that position us well in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year.","Profit was challenging, down 4.3% versus last year. Severe weather-related profit impacts accounted for approximately $120 million in headwind versus last year. Additionally, health care expenses increased at double-digit growth rates, or more than $110 million, primarily from increased enrollment and medical cost inflation.","We realized unanticipated double-digit percent growth in our maintenance and utilities expenses, associated with snow removal and higher utility rates and usage. Severe weather also created disruptions across our supply chain, causing freight backlog across much of the country. To keep our stores well stocked, we incurred incremental expenses for third-party transportation services and overtime wages. And, of course, we also continued to invest in price, resulting in a net 17 basis point decline in gross profit rate.","Q1 inventory grew at 5.3%, primarily from new store growth and slower sales in weather-related categories such as outdoor living. We continue to monitor our inventory levels and to position ourselves well for the summer and the rest of the year.","Now, let me cover the performance of our Neighborhood Markets and supercenters. Neighborhood Markets continue to perform well, delivering approximately a 5% comp sales increase for the quarter, driven by a nearly 4% increase in comp store traffic. We\u2019re seeing strength across the box, particularly in produce, meat, adult beverages, and pharmacy.","Our Neighborhood Market fleet performed consistently well through the entire quarter, including throughout the periods of inclement weather. In fact, April marks the 46th consecutive month of positive comps for the format, further validating our strategy to accelerate the unit growth. Neighborhood Markets delivered solid comp sales performance regardless of the age of the store.","In October, we communicated that 90% of our supercenter fleet was performing well. In Q1, these stores delivered a positive comp and improved over Q4 last year. For the remaining stores that require special attention, we\u2019ve developed unique, store-specific action plans and we\u2019re investing in leadership and additional staffing.","Early indications show improvement in key metrics, with comp sales for this group up more than 200 basis points from Q3 of last year, and customer experience scores also showing consistent improvement. While we\u2019re encouraged with the early results, we anticipate this will be an ongoing work in progress.","As we enter the third phase of our Walmart Express store test, we\u2019re exploring tethering this format to our larger supercenters. In this test, customers will be able to order supercenter merchandise at a rural Express store and receive it on the same day. On May 2, we opened the first fully tethered Walmart Express store in North Carolina. Customers are buying products, such as bicycles and swimming pools, which they can\u2019t traditionally get inside a 10,000-square foot box.","During the quarter, we opened 13 Neighborhood Markets and 25 supercenters, including 16 new and 9 conversions. We\u2019re on track to deliver about 115 supercenters, between 180 and 200 Neighborhood Markets and 90 to 100 Walmart Express stores this fiscal year.","We believe we\u2019re headed in the right direction. The team is diligently focused on improving sales by introducing increased innovation across the box. Just in the first quarter alone, we brought everyday low prices to the money transfer industry through our unique Walmart-2-Walmart service.","We also rolled out Wild Oats, a new line of organic food products in nearly half of our stores. We launched a video game trade-in program. We expanded our Savings Catcher pilot to seven markets, and we introduced an online Walmart auto insurance comparison service. And finally, beginning Sunday, May 18, we will re-launch our Great Gas Rollback program.","Now, I\u2019d like to review the performance of the various merchandising areas. In grocery, we\u2019ve seen a trend improvement despite approximately 90 basis points of headwind from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Overall grocery inflation is tracking at approximately 120 basis points. While our consumables business had a low single-digit negative comp, partly due to modest price deflation and overall industry softness, our food business delivered a positive comp.","We\u2019re seeing the strongest results in areas such as meat, produce and dairy, where we\u2019re investing to keep our prices low for customers despite pressure from cost inflation. Additionally, food delivered strong Easter results, with double-digit sales growth in Easter candy and strength across other categories such as meat and eggs.","Health & wellness improved more than 150 basis points versus Q4, led by our pharmacy business. Prescriptions delivered a mid-single-digit positive comp, driven by branded drug inflation and a strong increase in script counts. Script counts benefitted from new contracts in our Medicare business. Over-the-counter also improved, as a soft cough, cold, and flu season transitioned to robust allergy season.","Overall, general merchandise remained soft, primarily from weather impacts and declining industry dynamics, particularly in entertainment. Our Easter seasonal business delivered high single-digit positive sales growth. However, it was not enough to offset softness within hardlines and entertainment, which had negative comp sales.","In hardlines, inclement weather affected sporting goods and seasonal hardware, while entertainment continued to face challenges related to deflation. Despite industry deflation, we\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our new video game trade-in program, and we continue to focus on revitalizing our entertainment area. In the second quarter, we will re-lay our entertainment department, allocating more space and prominence to growth categories, while improving category adjacencies.","Apparel continues to perform well, driven by a strong Easter and national brands. We\u2019re really pleased with active wear, and how it performed throughout the quarter with a double-digit comp, driven by our Danskin Now and Russell Athletic offering. Our shoe and children\u2019s apparel business also had positive comps, benefitting from a solid performance from national brands such as Avia, Child of Mine by Carter\u2019s, and Garanimals.","Similar to apparel, home benefited from strong performance in national brands, such as Rachel Ray, Farberware, Magic Bullet, Keurig, and a broad assortment of basics. However, inclement weather drove softness in outdoor living, which includes patio furniture and live plants. Our stores are set and we\u2019re well prepared to meet customer demand as the weather improves.","Overall, I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019ve made in both home and apparel. The team continues to enhance our assortment and expand strong, national brands to deliver value across categories.","Our e-commerce business delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to total Walmart U.S. comp sales. Approximately two-thirds came from the walmart.com fulfilled sales and the remainder from store fulfilled orders. We saw particular strength in home, hardlines, toys & seasonal, and apparel, which was somewhat offset by softer results in electronics.","Overall, we\u2019re continuing to increase our capabilities in this area. To further integrate our digital platform with our store fleet, we\u2019ve recently rolled out an e-receipts program. The initiative makes it easier for our customers to keep track of their purchases and, when combined with the Savings Catcher program, will provide an opportunity for our customers to save even more. We also recently updated our mobile pharmacy app, and we\u2019re seeing strong customer response with usage across the country.","We\u2019re encouraged by the early results of our Denver grocery delivery and pick-up test, which has multiple pick-up points across 34 stores. Early sales are beating expectations and have already exceeded those of our San Francisco-San Jose pilot, which rolled out in calendar year 2011.","We continued to gain momentum during Q1 in our U.S. Manufacturing initiative. To date, over 65 leading research institutions have applied for funding from our $10 million U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund. We expect the first awards to be issued by the end of calendar year 2014.","Additionally, we announced that we will hold an \u201cOpen Call\u201d event in Bentonville on July 8. Current and potential suppliers can present items made in the USA to Walmart, walmart.com, and Sam\u2019s Club merchants. Registration is now open, and we\u2019re already seeing a tremendous response.","We expect to find great new items we can offer our customers this holiday season and beyond. We have solid business fundamentals and anticipate our recently launched initiatives and continued price investment will resonate with the customer. However, given the challenging retail environment, we expect comp sales to remain relatively flat for the 13-week period from May 3 through August 1, 2014.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave for an International update. Dave?","David Cheesewright","Thank you, Bill.","Overall, I\u2019m satisfied with our performance in the first quarter. In a challenging global economy, our teams delivered solid sales and profit growth by focusing on expanding price leadership and providing great customer service. We remain focused on being in good businesses and running them well. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic priorities, but there\u2019s still much to do. As I\u2019ve traveled around our markets, I\u2019ve been particularly impressed with the caliber of our associates. The passion and commitment in delivering our purpose of \u201csaving people money so they can live better\u201d is clear to see wherever we operate.","We continue to invest in expanding price leadership in key markets. For example, in Mexico, Superama lowered prices on more than 5,000 items and put in place a quality guarantee. In Brazil, our new advertising campaign that kicked off in February explains and reinforces to our customers in Brazil our mission of \u201csaving people money so they can live better.\u201d The value-themed ads include real life experiences from customers, as well as innovative appearances in TV shows and feature Brazil\u2019s national soccer coach.","To continue this pricing momentum across the globe, we\u2019re working with third party analysts, such as The Nielsen Company, to develop consistent market share reporting. The ability to have more timely access to data helps us react even more quickly to maintain price leadership and hold customer trust.","Driving the productivity loop to be the low cost operator in each market is core to our business model. The \u201cWe Operate for Less\u201d programs in China and Brazil are allowing us to offset wage inflation in those countries. In the U.K., we further rolled out the hybrid checkout system which speeds up the checkout process. Now more than half of all U.K. transactions are processed through a self-checkout.","Also, we delivered on our commitment to improve operational returns. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 5.3%, which outpaced our sales growth of 3.4%. On a reported basis, operating income growth also outpaced sales.","We continue to innovate and grow our e-commerce business globally, and we are delivering on our strategy of winning the integration of digital and physical. I\u2019ll discuss this more later. I\u2019m also excited about recently announced key leader moves. We have tremendous bench strength, and our ability to attract talented leaders and develop them globally, positions us to lead in our markets.","Scott Price will move from being CEO of Asia to our corporate support team, leading strategy, real estate, mergers and acquisition, as well as International leverage. Our International depth gives us the ability to promote a great leader like Greg Foran to head our Asia business, a key part of our growth. Sean Clarke will succeed Greg, leading our China business. Sean is one of our most experienced executives, having served in finance and operating roles in the U.K., Canada, Japan, Germany and now China.","At Massmart, Kuseni Dlamini was appointed as our new non-executive Chairman of the Board for our Sub-Saharan African business. Kuseni is an outstanding business leader, with deep experience in emerging markets and a global perspective on management and growth.","Additionally, Guy Hayward was promoted to President and Chief Executive Officer for our business in Africa. Guy has a wealth of retail and financial experience and has been an integral part of Massmart\u2019s success.","Now, let\u2019s get to our first quarter results. As mentioned earlier, I\u2019m pleased that we grew operating income at a faster rate than sales on a reported and constant currency basis. However, we did not leverage expenses this quarter, primarily as a result of sales challenges in a few of our markets and the timing of Chinese New Year and Easter.","We\u2019ve summarized our results as we always do \u2013 on a reported and constant currency basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. For Brazil and China, we discuss stores and e-commerce separately. Slide 8 of the accompanying presentation has all the details, but let me take a minute to provide some additional insights.","Of our five largest countries, Brazil delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. With the one month lag in reporting for all countries except Canada, the timing of Easter from the first to second quarter affected comp sales in countries like the U.K. and Mexico. Although we\u2019re not including detail for other markets on the slides, we will briefly mention Japan this quarter, which had a very solid performance.","On a relative basis, we were somewhat encouraged with our market share performance during the quarter for our largest markets. Based on the most recent data available for the quarter, we grew our share in Canada and Mexico. We lost market share in Brazil and China, where we closed stores. Share in the U.K. declined slightly, although we gained share relative to our largest competitors. We\u2019ll provide more details as we discuss the countries individually.","On a reported basis, inventory grew faster than sales at 3.4%, or 10% on a constant currency basis. With the later Easter, inventory levels increased in quarter 1 ahead of the selling period in quarter 2. Having said that, we have work to do in inventory in a few markets and we\u2019re focused on managing this more efficiently.","Key financial details are summarized on slides 7 and 8. I\u2019ll discuss performance insights on our five largest markets. All of these discussions are on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis.","Our net sales and comp sales declined for the quarter in the U.K. However, against a tough market backdrop, first quarter growth relative to the market improved over last year, and Asda grew ahead of its three major competitors in the 12 weeks ending March 30, according to Kantar. Even with a sales decline, operating income grew 6%, benefiting from strength in gross margin from the merchandising mix changes related to Easter.","Our strategy of \u201cRedefining Value Retailing in the U.K.\u201d is built around price investment to support our core mission. Sales of \u201cprice-locked\u201d products -- essential food items where prices have been permanently reduced, were more than 15 million units every week in the quarter. We launched a new George homewares range, and early sales were ahead of expectations.","With the expansion of Click & Collect, online grocery home shopping market share reached a new high of 19.2% for the period ended March 30, according to Kantar, and e-commerce sales were up more than 19.0% for the quarter compared to last year. Overall, our U.K. business continues to operate well and innovate. We\u2019re optimistic about winning in a competitive market.","Also in a competitive environment, Walmart Canada increased net sales, but comp sales declined. The excessively cold weather impacted retail sales throughout the market, particularly in seasonal categories such as apparel and outdoor. Health and wellness sales were negatively impacted by lower generic prescription reimbursement rates due to ongoing drug reform initiatives implemented by various provinces, as well as higher utilization of generics.","Sales were strongest in food and consumables, and according to Nielsen, we increased market share 42 basis points for the 12 weeks ended April 19. Our continued price investment resulted in an increased price gap to competitors. We\u2019re pleased with online sales as well, which delivered 134% growth. Operating income grew ahead of sales.","Now let\u2019s discuss performance in our Latin American markets. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported first quarter results on April 22 under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. Our Walmex results exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, which results are recorded in discontinued operations. We received regulatory approval to proceed with the transaction and closed the deal on May 9.","Walmex consolidated net sales grew 1.5% during the first quarter, impacted by the Easter calendar flip. Operating income grew 0.8%, mainly as a result of expense deleverage in Mexico, impacted primarily by the Easter flip and softer sales. Operating income was also aided by certain items.","Mexico\u2019s self-service business, including Sam\u2019s Club, outperformed the market by 60 basis points in the first quarter, according to Antad. Aggressive price investments made in the Bodega Aurrera, Superama and Walmart Supercenter formats resulted in sales growth outpacing the market by 400 basis points. Our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express and our stand alone pharmacies, delivered strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables.","Sam\u2019s Club, which represents approximately 26% of our Mexico revenue, continues to perform below our expectations. The team is focused on reinvigorating our value proposition by providing an exciting assortment through treasure hunt and differentiated merchandise for our Advantage members, and by adding additional value for business members. In addition, we\u2019re leveraging best practices from our U.S. Sam\u2019s Club business. While we\u2019re confident about our long-term strategy, we expect Sam\u2019s Club to be challenged in the near term.","Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand the Walmex e-commerce business, with additional general merchandise categories now online. Also, Superama\u2019s online grocery delivery is still growing, providing our customers with the opportunity to access via computers, smartphones and tablets. The Walmex team continues to drive the business, and in particular, we remain focused on improving our Sam\u2019s performance.","Let\u2019s next talk about Brazil. I was recently in Brazil where I saw first-hand the team\u2019s alignment and commitment to stabilizing the business. We\u2019re implementing a number of initiatives to build a stronger foundation, including investments in price leadership and in improving our productivity.","These investments are focused on both our retail and wholesale formats, and we\u2019re pleased with improved trends in food and consumables. We expect that as we continue to make progress, we will see similar trends in general merchandise, and will be able to drive sales growth going forward.","The retail market in Brazil continues to decelerate, in line with the economy. Despite this and the Easter calendar flip, first quarter net sales and comp sales grew, and we leveraged expenses. As planned, operating income declined due to investments in key initiatives and pricing.","While we still have a ways to go in Brazil, we further strengthened our talent base in key areas such as operations, finance, compliance, human resources and merchandising over the past year. Therefore, I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about the improvement we are seeing.","Moving now to Asia, Walmart China\u2019s comp sales were negative 2.5%. This year, Chinese New Year was slightly earlier than last year, so a greater proportion of pre-holiday spending was in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding this calendar impact, comp sales would have been about flat to last year. Sales in China also faced significant headwinds from government austerity programs, which continue to curb gift card sales. Additionally, price deflation in key categories such as edible oil, liquor and infant formula negatively impacted sales.","Our business transformation program, now in its third year, continued to deliver improvements to margins and reductions in expenses. We\u2019ve been able to invest in further price reductions for customers, and we increased operating income by 26.2% for the quarter.","Turning to Japan, we had a strong first quarter, with both net sales and comp growth. Sales growth was aided by pre-buying ahead of the consumption tax increase, which went into effect on April 1. Walmart Japan gained market share in the first quarter and the business has continued to perform nicely, even since the tax increase. Higher sales and expense control led to 111 basis points of leverage, resulting in healthy operating income growth. So, as you can see, there are some encouraging signs in our key markets, and we\u2019re committed to continuing this progress.","Last, let me give you a brief recap of our e-commerce results. We believe that our e-commerce business is one of the most dynamic in the world, and this was another strong quarter. As an example of our innovation, we further expanded the Asda Click & Collect program at over 300 Asda stores and other locations. This quarter saw further innovation with a first-to-market initiative allowing same day pick-up in 89 locations, with plans to expand to all stores this year.","We\u2019re pleased with our first quarter results in China and Brazil. We continue to see strong comp growth in our China e-commerce business. Site traffic at Yihaodian grew in the triple digits, and ticket was up as well. Yihaodian sells both food and general merchandise and SKU counts are double last year, with over 3 million items now available.","Yihaodian sold over 1 million liters of imported milk and set the Guinness record for \u201cthe most milk sold on a single online platform in 24 hours.\u201d This is a testament to our ability to leverage Walmart\u2019s supply chain for the benefit of our online businesses. Our growth in mobile is also impressive, as we almost reached the same number of mobile sales in the quarter as we had in the entire business last year.","In Brazil, we again saw sales growth of more than twice the overall e-commerce market, and we saw record traffic growth, driven in part by new affiliate agreements. Our \u201cConsumer Day\u201d in March drove sales nearly three times that of a normal day, with strength in computers and smartphones. We continue to see record sales by mobile users, with three times the mobile sales we had last year.","As a global company, we have a responsibility to lead on compliance, social and environmental issues. Over the past year, we\u2019ve made major investments in compliance. We built better processes, increased training for our associates and strengthened our organizational leadership.","I\u2019m also proud to see the impact our teams make by giving back to the communities in which we operate. For example, Walmart Chile rushed to help the victims of earthquakes and wild fires that recently impacted northern and central Chile. The company sent bottled water, blankets, diapers and personal hygiene products to meet the primary needs of the victims.","In conclusion, we continue to execute on our strategy of being in good businesses and running them well. Throughout the world, we remain focused on several key areas, which we shared with you in February: drive strong comp sales by expanding price leadership, create a platform for sustainable growth in China, turn around Brazil, rejuvenate Mexico, accelerate growth in e-commerce, be the lowest cost operator, and build trust wherever we operate.","We see momentum in our markets, and I continue to be optimistic about the future. We have the talent, strategy and commitment to achieve success, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thanks, Dave.","The fiscal year started with several challenges for our core member, resulting in one of our more difficult quarters. The combination of severe weather and the reduction of public assistance represented an approximate 90 basis point impact to comp sales. In addition, Q1 was marked by a rapid acceleration in inflation, as cost inflation was approximately 160 basis points, compared to 30 basis points in Q4.","Despite our efforts to combat these challenges, sales did not materialize as expected. Net sales grew 0.5%, without fuel, to $12.2 billion. Operating income declined 1.4% to $477 million. Our comp for the 13-week period ending May 2, excluding fuel, declined 0.5%, comprised of both decreases in traffic and ticket.","In recent quarters, our Savings member traffic has helped to offset the softness in our Business member segment. This quarter we saw positive, yet lower Savings member traffic, coupled with slower ticket acceleration \u2013 primarily in our lower to middle income members. Business member traffic and ticket remained soft.","Over the past year, our merchants have been elevating the value and uniqueness of our merchandise assortment. We\u2019re seeing positive results in areas where we\u2019ve introduced newness. These areas of growth mirror current member trends around \u201cfresh, fast and fit\u201d. Let me give you some examples.","Within \u201cfit\u201d, our new assortment of snacking options, which includes exclusive \u201cbetter for you\u201d choices, is helping to drive double-digit unit growth. Also, our on-trend \u201cathleisure\u201d active wear helped deliver a double-digit positive comp in ladies apparel.","We\u2019ve also enhanced our private label offering by introducing new, high quality items and consolidating the existing assortment into three main labels: Member\u2019s Mark, Daily Chef and Simply Right. The recent investments are being recognized. For example, Member\u2019s Mark Ultimate Clean laundry detergent received top rankings from a leading external rating agency.","While our category level merchandising results this quarter were mixed, we remain confident in our strategy to deliver more newness, more often. We are monitoring our inventory levels, which grew 7.6%, driven in part by softer sales and build-ups for new items in categories such as home and health and wellness.","Within fresh, freezer and cooler, cost inflation in meat and dairy outpaced retail inflation, pressuring units and leading to a low single-digit positive comp. The late arrival of spring, along with the increased cost of beef and pork, influenced the early grilling season \u2013 an area where we have historically been strong. Within produce, hard freezes caused citrus availability issues, which were partially offset by strong strawberry and watermelon crops.","Dry grocery and beverage struggled this quarter, as the decreases in total box traffic contributed to the low single-digit negative comp. While our new sweet and salty snack offering performed well, it was not enough to offset unit declines in larger categories like beverages. Ancillary categories had a negative impact on the quarter, due to sales declines in tobacco and tires. There were fewer promotional events in a leading tire brand compared to last year.","Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member awareness and usage of our pharmacy continues to grow, contributing to a high single-digit positive comp. Over-the-counter however, pressured the entire category, as we lapped strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items.","During the transition to newness, we\u2019ve experienced slight declines in consumables, recording a low single-digit negative comp. Our merchants are actively looking for ways to differentiate, particularly in pet supplies and home care, moving to products with even greater value.","Within technology and entertainment, supplier inventory issues caused disruption within TVs and tablets, contributing to a high single-digit negative comp. In addition, wireless was pressured by shifting industry dynamics, as carriers change the structure of their contract terms. With","Walmart\u2019s acquisition of the assets comprising Simplexity LLC\u2019s wireless activation platform earlier this month, we will be able to more efficiently support wireless activations for our members. We expect the benefits of this acquisition to materialize for both the Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart U.S. businesses in the coming quarters.","Home, apparel and hardlines reported a low single-digit positive comp. While this is a slight deceleration from prior quarters, we remain pleased with our elevated assortment in this space. In seasonal hardware and gardening, new, high quality items resonated extremely well with members. Our growth was tempered by mattresses, which underperformed in geographic areas most impacted by weather, resulting in unit declines year-over-year.","Samsclub.com delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, contributing approximately 20 basis points to the total Sam\u2019s Club comp. One of the contributors to this growth was Click\u2018n\u2019Pull, a free service that lets members place their orders online or by fax, and pick them up the next morning. We\u2019re revamping Click\u2018n\u2019Pull to further increase convenience for our members, particularly those with micro-businesses.","We\u2019ve also begun testing \u201cMy Subscriptions\u201d, a pilot service that allows members to order items like diapers online, with discounted shipping rates. Investments such as these demonstrate our commitment to the integration of \u201cbricks and clicks\u201d and represent an opportunity to appeal to more tech-savvy members.","Now back to the reported financials, excluding fuel. For our financial results including fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation. Gross profit rate declined 29 basis points due to shifts in merchandise mix and rising commodity costs.","The combination of increased labor costs and weather-related utility costs contributed to a modest deleverage of 3 basis points. You may recall that last quarter, our expenses were negatively impacted by a field organization restructure. We were able to place a larger number of affected associates in open roles within Sam\u2019s Club or the larger Walmart organization than we had originally anticipated. Because of this, our severance related costs were less than our Q4 accrual, benefitting operating expenses by 7 basis points.","Our operational performance continues to exceed members\u2019 expectations. According to the 2014 Temkin Experience Ratings, Sam\u2019s Club received the top ranking for best customer experience in retail. This is the third consecutive year Sam\u2019s Club has been recognized.","Membership and other income remains a bright spot, growing 10.5%. Membership income by itself grew 10.9%, due primarily to the fee increase taken a year ago. In addition, Plus member upgrades and Plus member renewals performed well. In regards to Plus member growth, the South Central region has outperformed the rest of the country over the past year, due to the Plus member cash rewards pilot launched in fiscal 13.","Weather related traffic trends affected sign-ups and renewals, which were soft this quarter. You may recall that we had a very successful social media event during this time last year. The members acquired through this campaign are now beginning to renew their memberships, and recent renewal rates are exceeding internal expectations.","As I close, I want to emphasize our confidence in the merchandising and membership enhancements we\u2019ve made over the past year \u2013 including the transformation of our merchandise assortment and the launch of our Instant Savings book, which was ranked the #1 member benefit in fiscal year 14.","With the intention of growing our member base, both through acquisition and retention, I\u2019m excited to announce the national rollout of Sam\u2019s Club Plus Member Cash Rewards, which goes into effect on June 12, 2014. This new benefit provides $10 for every $500 spent on qualifying purchases. All members will continue to receive Instant Savings offers; however, the benefit of Cash Rewards will be exclusively for Plus members. Coupled with the right merchandise and an exceptional experience, we believe Cash Rewards will further differentiate us from mass retailers and help bring us to parity within the club channel.","Furthermore, we will launch a new cash-back credit card with MasterCard on June 23, 2014, offering cardholders the opportunity to earn 5% cash back on gas, 3% back on travel and dining, and 1% on everything else. This simple, industry leading program rewards members for everyday spend, making it even more valuable to be a Sam\u2019s Club member.","We expect that investments like these will create a clear path for sustainable sales and member growth for the long term, but these investments, along with continued gross profit rate pressure, will be an operating profit headwind for the near term. We expect flat comp sales growth for the 13-week period ending August 1. This compares to a comp increase of 1.7% last year.","Now, let me pass the mic over to Charles for our close. Charles?","Charles Holley","Thanks, Roz.","Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about several aspects of our business.","We added over $850 million in consolidated net sales. This included a $1.6 billion negative impact from foreign currency. We delivered earnings per share within our guidance, albeit the low end. Our earnings per share were impacted by the quarter\u2019s severe weather, along with a higher effective tax rate than we anticipated. Walmart U.S. comp sales results were within guidance. We experienced solid net sales growth in 4 out of our 5 major international markets. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 27% on a global basis.","Looking at the rest of the year, our teams have a clear focus on driving comp sales and delivering on our other growth initiatives. We\u2019re also committed to growing our store base. Net square footage increased to 1.1 billion square feet at the end of the first quarter, which is up 4 million square feet from the end of fiscal 2014. Because of our large base, the increase is 0.4%; however, the additional 4 million square feet is still significant.","We continue to be excited about our e-commerce businesses and the rapid growth we\u2019re experiencing in this area. We continue to make progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment, and we expect these improvements to continue. In fact, during the quarter, we opened 2 dedicated e-commerce fulfillment centers -- one in Pennsylvania and the other in Brazil.","We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities. To put things into perspective, over the last three years, we\u2019ve acquired 12 companies, which today serve as the driving force behind the innovative work our e-commerce teams are doing. Our acquisition earlier this month of Adchemy is a great example of how we\u2019re adding talent to @WalmartLabs, as well as enhancing our capabilities in areas like semantic search, data analytics and web marketing.","To be clear, our investments are not only intended to attract e-commerce customers, but also to help them navigate and shop our physical stores. With nearly 11,000 stores, over 2.2 million associates worldwide and a growing presence of highly skilled engineers in Silicon Valley, we feel we are uniquely positioned to offer a best in class e-commerce experience.","Although we were not able to leverage our expenses this quarter, we remain committed to maintaining a rigid focus on everyday low cost within our operations. This will enable us to continue our price investment.","The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, was negative. This was partly caused by a shift in Easter versus last year within our International segment. However, we do have work to do within all segments to improve our working capital performance in the future. This will be an important focus over the next few quarters.","Now, you\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our capital, and the first is organic growth. Recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we increased our capital allocation plan for Walmart U.S. by $600 million to support our accelerated rollout of additional Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express. Small stores continue to represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. Given our plan, expect capital expenditures to be heavier in the back half of the fiscal year.","Our second priority is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will add to our retail platform, support our operations or strengthen our e-commerce capabilities. Last, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","As Claire covered earlier, we used $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations. This affected the share repurchase amount for the quarter. It\u2019s important to remind you that we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, and we will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases throughout the year.","Next, let\u2019s move on to guidance. Based on our views of the macro-economic and sales environment in the U.S. and around the world, we expect second quarter fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to range between $1.15 and $1.25. These estimates assume currency exchange rates remain at the current levels. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share guidance assumes $0.02 to $0.04 per share of incremental investment in e-commerce. We began to anniversary the expenses related to FCPA matters this quarter, and we continue to anticipate these expenses will range between $200 million and $240 million for the fiscal year.","In addition, it\u2019s important to remember the following with regards to our second quarter guidance. First, as you heard from Bill, in the first quarter, we incurred more than $100 million of costs from higher benefit enrollment and utilization by our U.S. associates, as well as cost inflation. While associate enrollment does fluctuate, we continue to expect these costs to be a headwind of more than $300 million for the full year.","Second, we will not cycle through SNAP reductions until the end of the third quarter for our U.S. businesses, and we will continue to invest in price for our customers and members.","Third, we expect headwinds for the remainder of the year from our increased investment in the Sam\u2019s Club cash rewards program and the cash-back credit card that will both launch in June.","Fourth, we continue to expect our fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32% and 34%. For the second quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be at the high end of this guidance. It\u2019s also important to remember that our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year. Despite these headwinds, we remain cautiously optimistic about the second quarter and the balance of the year.","Thank you for your interest in Walmart.

Good morning, and welcome to Walmart's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. I'm joined by Doug McMillon, Walmart's President and CEO; and Brett Biggs, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In a few moments, Doug and Brett will provide their view on the fourth quarter, our outlook for fiscal year 2020 and discuss progress on our strategic initiatives.

We're encouraged by our performance for the year, because we believe our customers are noticing our improvements but we continue to see many ways we can serve them better.","We're even more convinced they want us and expect us to bring our stores and eCommerce business together, an additionally connected seamless way that make shopping easier. We experienced a favorable economic environment in the U.S. for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to draw the strength of our results. Brett will go into more detail on our results shortly.","I am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter. In Q4, Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 4.2% excluding fuel, eCommerce sales increased 43% and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys, according to Nielsen and the NPD Group.","Sam's Club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5.3% excluding fuel and tobacco. And in international, comps were positive in the majority of our markets. Strong top line results allow us to reiterate the FY'20 sales and profit guidance we gave in October, even as we landed FY'19 ahead of where we expected.","We strive to make every day easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time. Part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths, such as having a broad assortment including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population.","Our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we're using technology to change how we work. More customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it's important that we engage them in different ways. We've learned that those customers who shop with us, both in stores and online, spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores.","Across the business, you can see examples of how we're meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement. In the U.S. we offer grocery pick up at more than 2100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations, which represents about 69% and 36% of the population respectively. Feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive, which speaks of the capabilities of roughly 37,000 personal shoppers.","In Mexico, we're delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option. It's available on their mobile phones and in-store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times. In addition, through our investment in the crowdsourced Delivery Platform Dada-JD Daojia, customers in China get their merchandise in less than an hour of placing the order and it's picked from a network of more than 280 locations.","We continue to build trust which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage. Around the world, Walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good. Whether it's our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like, India or a larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in U.S. by 2025. Customers can feel good about Walmart. The company that starts everyday with a goal of earning their business.","It's nice to be recognized for the work we're doing to promote shared value. In fact, the company recently received an A minus rating on the CDP's annual environmental scorecard, up from a B rating last year. And we're ranked as the survey's top-performing U.S. based food retailer.","Shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital, deliver strong efficient growth, reduce costs and operate with discipline. Within this construct; customers, associates, communities and shareholders can win.","Now let's move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments. I'll begin with Walmart U.S. where the team had a great year. Comp sales growth of 3.6% for fiscal year 2019 exceeded our expectations. The work that team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive. The team leveraged operating expenses overall, even as we invested in wages, training, technology and eCommerce.","Store level productivity is strong, due in part to the training we are providing our associates. As the nature of work continues to change, we're innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills, thriving their jobs and growing their careers. This coming year, we'll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences.","Overall I'm pleased with what I see operationally and with our merchandizing. The investments we're making in our people, remodels, and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate, fast, friendly, and fun to shop. Having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise. In our stores, you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands.","We're also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys. We are making progress in eCommerce. Our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise. We're expanding our assortment, improving search enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews, inventory mirroring, and on-time delivery to accomplish this.","And of course, we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products. Sales in eCommerce increased 40% for the year. We will continue to play off and innovate as we shape the future of our omni retail. This includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery.","Our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems, plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales, but we need to make more progress to improve profitability. Our fulfillment shipping costs were improving as we continue to enhance our assortment, repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability.","We might get progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with Lord & Taylor, Ellen DeGeneres, Advance Auto, Sofia Vergara, and Fanatics to name a few. These initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index, as well as NPS which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year. Many opportunities exist, mainly driven by data and we'll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better, than we do today.","At Sam's Club, the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people, products, and working in a more digital way. Excluding fuel and tobacco, comp sales for the year increased 5.7% and eCommerce sales grew 27%. When someone downloads the app, shops on samsclub.com, or uses our Scan & Go, they're more likely to renew. We're encouraged by the trends we see in membership.","As of year-end, we saw improvements in signups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to what it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10% of the fleet.","In international, eight of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year, including the four major markets and overall sales increased 2.9% in constant currency. It's been a big year for International as we run the business while shaping the portfolio.","Walmex continues to be strong. The improvements we're making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in NPS in each of our formats. Similar to the U.S., we're now leveraging our store base to offer same-day delivery.","We recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5,000 general merchandise items to this service. We continue to invest in our stores and in eCommerce to build an omni-channel experience, tailored to customers in this market.","Our business in Canada also continues to perform well. The team's moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni-channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets.","For example, we've entered into new partnerships this year in cities like Toronto and Vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise. In the UK, Brexit and the potential implications of a hard Brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone. No matter the situation, Asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers. I visited our team in the UK a few weeks ago and I'm really impressed with their performance, their attitudes and the leadership. They're amazing.","In India, we remain optimistic about the eCommerce opportunity given the size of the market. The low penetration of eCommerce and the retail channel and the pace, at which it's growing. In the future, we hope to work with the government for pro-growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers, farmers and suppliers to benefit from it develop and prosper. In terms of the regulatory environment, we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation, but the team has worked to ensure that we're in compliance with the new rules. We are committed to providing sellers with a world-class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service. We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field.","Turning to China, we continue to see significant growth opportunities. Overall, we've identified provinces that are priority for us and we're improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as a new store designs and omni-channel initiatives. Uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment, but I like the things we're doing to position ourselves in this important market.","Across international, we're accelerating omni-channel capabilities with the farthest along in China due to the partnership with JD.Com, our relationship with Tencent and the investments we've made in Last Mile delivery. We're also accelerating omni growth in Canada, Mexico, Chile and Japan through partnerships and acquisitions. International team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe.","In closing, let me say how pleased I am about all that we've accomplished over the last year and how excited I'm about what's still to come. We see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and eCommerce but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations, competition persist, and the omni retail story continues to evolve. We fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next five years versus the last five years with emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further and we're adapting. But we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality. ","We will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive. Within our ecosystem, we will pursue to grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to other that can generate new revenue streams. Our commitment to the customers is clear. We'll be there when where and how they want to shop. Our distinctive set of assets, financial strength, and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely Walmart.","Brett you want to pick it up there.","Brett Biggs","You bet. Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. I'm excited to talk about our results this morning. Walmart had a really good year and we're pleased with the fourth quarter results as well. We have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan which we believe is the winning formula long-term.","I'll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year. Total revenue and constant currency was just over $515 billion and increased $14.8 billion or 3%. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 3.6%, the highest annual growth rate in 10 years. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 40% nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past two years.","We made a number of strategic choices to position Walmart International for success including the acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in Brazil. We made progress on expenses and are particularly proud of the leverage in Walmart U.S. stores. Excluding discrete items from last year, we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year.","Adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.91, operating cash flow was strong at $27.8 billion, and the company returned $13.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We're pleased with what we've accomplished, but not satisfied. This year and quarter are further proofs that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near-term results while positioning the business for the longer term. We're leveraging our scale, unique assets, and financial strength in ways others can't.","Now, let's move on to the fourth quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter topline growth; the total constant currency revenue grew 3.1% to $140.5 billion with currency having a negative effect of approximately $1.7 billion.","Walmart U.S. comp sales growth of 4.2% was a bit better than expected as strong holiday results and early release of government assistance benefited sales. International grew net sales 2.7% in constant currency led by strength at Walmex and Sam's Club had solid comp sales growth of 5.3% excluding fuel and tobacco.","Consolidated gross margins, gross profit margin declined 21 basis points, due primarily to the mix effect from e-commerce growth in India and the U.S. and price investments in certain markets. We had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year's discrete items.","SG&A leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year's discrete items, but was partially offset by dilution from Flipkart. Excluding these items, we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant currency basis.","The adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24.6%. As a reminder, the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in jd.com, adjustments related to the tax reform, and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil.","For the fourth quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 22.8% and benefited EPS by about $0.04 per share, primarily due to the effect of the numerous federal tax regulations issued late in Q4. Adjusted EPS increased 6% to $1.41 and GAAP EPS was $1.27.","Now let's discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment. Walmart U.S. continued to have greater sales momentum. Comp sales excluding fuel grew 4.2% in the quarter and 6.8% on two-year stack basis. The best result in nine years. We started the quarter with strong Thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales. Although bases sales were strong, we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early SNAP funding.","Clearly, we're operating in a healthy consumer environment, but our integrated omni offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season. We had solid traffic and ticket up 0.9% and 3.3% respectively, while eCommerce sales grew 43% and contributed approximately 180 basis points of segment comp.","We're encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to Nielsen and The NPD Group. Our strong mid-single digit comp growth in grocery led to the best tier stack in nine years. Health and wellness delivered a low single-digit comp sales gain and general merchandise comp sales were up mid-single digit percentage with a strong holiday performance in toys and seasonal categories. Our inventory position is good as we enter the New Year.","In Walmart U.S. eCommerce, we've made good progress on a number of initiatives as Doug mentioned. We are still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long-term profit profile we want. The team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel, which will help margin rate as well simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions.","As we outlined in October, we expect our losses in eCommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure, people, online grocery and store number 8 initiatives. While we've made good progress against our strategy in recent years, we still have great opportunity in front of us. We remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same day grocery delivery in the coming year, while also adding grocery pick up to another 1000 stores.","The boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur and we're in a great position to capitalize on that. Walmart U.S. gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of eCommerce growth pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses. Expense leverage was strong reflecting strong sales increased productivity and overlap from last year's discrete items.","The Walmart U.S. stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eight consecutive quarters even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year. Operating income increased by more than 7% during the quarter. Overall, we're really pleased with the momentum we have in the Walmart U.S. business.","Moving to International. Net sales in constant currency increased 2.7%, but declined 2.3% on a reported basis due to the negative currency effects of approximately $1.7 billion. The deconsolidation of Brazil was a self head wind offset by the inclusion of Flipkart sales for full quarter. Our major markets was saw positive comps from Walmex Canada and the U.K. Results in Mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4.6% in the quarter and we continue to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories including food and staples according to ANTAD.","In the U.K. Asda's progress on improving the value proposition growing online grocery share and expanding private label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps. In China, we saw slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the Mid-Autumn Festival and a slower economic environment effected sales growth. Without the calendar shift comp sales would have been positive.","As expected, international operating income declined 2.8% in constant currency and 9.9% on reported basis. Factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from Flipkart partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year's discrete charges. Flipkart's results were in line with our expectations.","Overall, very pleased with the progress being made in Walmart International. Sam's Club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3.3% excluding fuel and 5.3% when excluding fuel and tobacco. The transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and eCommerce sales grew 21%.","We're seeing improved membership sign-ups and NPS scores. And in fact, despite closing 10% of our clubs at the end of last year, overall membership counts are about flat year-over-year. Sam's operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year's discrete charges for club closures. Excluding these items, operating income would have been flat. Excluding fuel and up about 9% with fuel.","I'll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020. As always, we have several assumptions in our guidance, including the economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent.","As always, we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in JD.Com. We're also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions. As we mentioned in October, we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind.","Regarding Flipkart, with any change like this, there can be some disruption to the business, but we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption. There'll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations, but we don't currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year.","You'll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last October, while there's been some growing uncertainty in the overall macro-economic and political environment, we're confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate.","We finished the year with good momentum. So today we're reiterating the previous guidance provided in October, which speaks to the consistency of our business. I'll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning's press release.","I'll start with sales guidance. We expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3% on a constant-currency basis in FY'20. With the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half, due to some timing and comparison, including the deconsolidation of Brazil and the addition of Flipkart.","Keep in mind, on a reported basis, we've seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results. If the current spot rates were to continue into next year, there will be currency headwind to reported sales of around $3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year.","For Walmart U.S., we still expect comp store growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the more difficult comparisons. We expect the quarterly cadence of comp store growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year, ranging from approximately 2.5% to 3.5% in any given quarter.","Walmart U.S. eCommerce is expected to grow sales around 35% in FY'20 and we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30% to below 40% range. We still expect the leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in FY'20. We'll continue to make progress on being more efficient at lowering cost, especially in Walmart U.S. stores, where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points, due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity. ","On a consolidated basis, we expect to slightly lever in Q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year. Timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter-to-quarter versus our expectations.","Turning to profitability, we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single digit percentage, primarily due to Flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019. We would expect operating income to increase excluding the Flipkart effects.","We expect EPS to decline by low single digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% to 27.5%. Keep in mind that increase in the rate relative to FY'19 adjusted tax rate relates to the Flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we've mentioned previously.","Excluding the full year EPS dilution expected from Flipkart, we would expect EPS to grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage. As you would expect, the quarterly year-over-year change in operating income and EPS will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of Flipkart only being in our results in part Q3 and all of Q4 last year.","We currently expect operating income and EPS to decrease by around 10% in Q1 decrease by a low to mid-single digit percentage in Q2 and Q3 and increase in Q4 to achieve our full year guidance. As always, the growth quarter-to-quarter can change due to timing and other factors.","Our priorities for capital allocation remains unchanged. We'll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives. We also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today. And we continue with our current share repurchase program.","Before I close, I want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors. Similar to the past, we will host the question-and-answer session in Northwest Arkansas in June in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting. However, instead of hosting an investment community meeting in October as we typically have, we plan to have an event in February 2020 in New York in conjunction with our Q4 earnings release. This meeting will be similar to the format we typically had, where you'll hear updates on our performance, guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders but a location that's closer to many of you. As always, we'll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts.","Let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company. I'm as optimistic as I have ever been about what Walmart can become. It's a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win.","And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. ","And our first question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","My first question is on expense leverage. You mentioned the 20 basis points, and I think you just clarified in your comments Brett it's total company. So, can we dig a little bit more into what's driving it? And if we back into gross margin, then within the context of your overall guidance that implies gross margins will be down. And so my question is, if gross margin pressure is, let\u2019s say more acute than you expect how much flexibility do you have on the expense line over the course of the year?","Brett Biggs","Thanks, Simeon. We talked a lot over the last few months about -- last few quarters about expense leverage. It comes from a number of different places. We've seen great expense leverage in the U.S., certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that. But as the technology and the training that we've done in the past -- technology put in place and the training we've done in the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers. So, as you saw even in October, some of the technology that's coming something we keep doing with our stores, we expect the productivity in the U.S. stores will continue to be a big part of what we do. When you look at really around the world, we're seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets. As you know with leverage, it could be a lot of small things that add up, but we're doing some bigger things as well. I talked recently about the work we're doing in shared services that we're viewing that as more of a real strength of the company. This past year, we hired a Chief Procurement Officer for the first time for goods, not for resale, so we're putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage. ","So, I feel good about the numbers we've put out, and I think there's going to be room for us. The timing of that is always challenging to figure out. You're correct on gross margin, and that's the implication that we have. We're going to continue to invest in price for the customer, which we've done. The mix of the business will continue to change, which changes a bit the nature of our company, and we've always said a couple of things: One is getting our expenses right allows us to do what we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers. And so, that's the main think we want to do with expenses. And we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company, and then we can make changes throughout the year. Hope, I answered your question, Simeon.","Simeon Gutman","Yes, yes. So, my follow-up with regards to eCommerce and online. And I think Doug made a comment around profitability and maybe repeat customer purchases, and I think you did as well Brett. So look, it's taking longer than -- it sounds like it's taking longer than you think to get to profitability. I think we know that already, but can you talk about what's been the biggest surprise. Is it, you're making less on the consumables mix than you thought, you're just not seeing enough long tail yet. I think Doug insinuated, we should make progress on the repeat rate, I assume that means it's not as strong as you think. Is it costing you more to run these mega DCs? Any more clarity on what line of progress we need to see the most on to get to that profitability.","Doug McMillon","Yes, Simeon, this is Doug. I think the headline answer is it\u2019s mix, and that mix has got to generate a customer experience that drives repeat business. So if you break it down into pieces, we\u2019ve got this advantage of having the stores and fresh and perishables in the assortment of supercenters close to customers, we're trying to drive that advantage and I believe we've got good traction there.","In parallel, we're trying to build an eCommerce business. In apparel, general merchandise you saw recently a new home launch from us with the brand Modern, for example. Trying to build an apparel home hard lines business that brings customers back and generates a positive contribution margin for the basket. ","And there are different components of that basket. There's the pick cost, the shipping cost, and then just the gross margin on the products. And the thing that's taking longer than what I would have guessed is to build that merchandise assortment including the brands that we're trying to add to a place where we got a repeatable healthy mix of business online. So we're pedaling fast trying to make that happen and disappointed that it's taken us long as it has.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Proceed with your question.","Bob Drbul","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, the first question is on the eCommerce side, can you talk a little but about the success, the quarterly success and your confidence in the 35%? And how much of the toy category helped both in the fourth quarter when you think about the next year guidance on eCommerce?","Doug McMillon","Bob, this is Doug. We're confident in that 35% number for eCommerce, and we'll drive that as I just mentioned earlier with the food and perishable business coming out of the supercenters, and we'll also drive it with the fulfillment center assortment that we're working on. Toys was a help in the fourth quarter. There was an opportunity there and the team did a good job of seizing it in total across stores and online.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And then can you spend a little bit of time, you've given us a lot on the Flipkart performance. But I guess can you talk about the topline of the Flipkart since the regulatory changes and sort of how you're thinking about the business in terms of the trends? You said you're in line with the plan in the fourth quarter, but when you think about where we are today heading into 2019?","Doug McMillon","I can't comment on the future the guidance for Flipkart in the first quarter. I'll just say that the things that have happened have been disappointed in some way, but they haven't shaken our confidence and excitement about what this is going to mean to the company long-term.","And this isn't a story about one quarter or even one year. We hope to have an effective productive dialogue as it relates to future changes that happen. But in terms of how the business has behaved, it's in line with what we thought it would be.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Benedict","Hey guys, good morning. First, Doug at that tail end of your comments on your prepared remarks, you mentioned new revenue streams as part of the longer term opportunity for Walmart. So, can you expand on that thought a little bit and perhaps speak to how you envision these potentially playing in the longer term ROI equation for the company. That's my first question.","Doug McMillon","Sure. In fact, I will take you back to the October Analyst Meeting, Peter, we put up a chart that we referred to as an ecosystem chart. And our thought process is that we've got this core merchandising capability that we can continue to strengthen and we can transform in some ways in terms of how we work differently, how we use technology. And build on that with data and other components of our business to grow health and wellness where we've got an opportunity to be more important in that space.","And financial service is another area where we've historically done some things, but there appeared to be more opportunities there for us. And there are some others that were represented on that chart that we're currently working on in a global fashion to create a business model by market that not only resonates with customers, but also delivers return for shareholders.","Peter Benedict","Okay, thanks for that. And then Brett I just -- the U.S. average ticket up 3.3%, another great number there. Can you maybe unpack that a little bit inflation mix? And is there any tariff pass-through that we've seen or that we're going to see as we look out to 2019? Thank you.","Brett Biggs","Hey you bet. Thanks Peter. Yes, in traffic and ticket, you probably heard me say this every quarter, traffic and ticket quarter-to-quarter can go back and forth and certainly we're focused on both and we're focused on the total. Happy with both.","If you look at traffic, it's a two and a half year stack, so we're continuing to see good traffic coming at our stores. This is going to be influenced some by the continuing shift of our business with online grocery. With e-commerce you get a little different mix of basket in there.","And category-by-category, Peter, you're seeing some categories that are deflating. We always have some of that; electronics will be one of those. And we've had some tariffs and there are places in which that does gets passed along and that does impact ticket.","We're not seeing a great deal of inflation. I would call it fairly modest at this point. When you look at what we're doing from a price perspective, I think our customers really aren't seeing much inflation because of what we're doing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Kelly Bania","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to the operating expense leverage, you talked about some of the training and technology impact on that, but can you give us more color in terms of the rollout and some of the technologies that you highlighted at the Analyst Day what we should expect this year and over the next couple of years?","Doug McMillon","This is Doug, Kelly. I think it's going to take us some time to sort that out and communicate specifically with some of the pieces of equipment that you saw, but it will happen. And we're just going to take our time, roll it from store group to store group. I'm really pleased and excited with how our managers are responding to all these new tools. They're now out in the stores. There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for it. So that is a key part of our plan and we'll update you as things go on. But it will take us some time to put all of the pieces together that we shared with you and some others that we've got coming.","Brett Biggs","And Kelly, this is Brett. We do -- as we said in October, we do feel like that as we see technologies developed and the processes we're coming up with. We do see opportunities to leverage over the next period of time as well.","Kelly Bania","Great. And just a follow-up on the last comment about your customers not maybe seeing that much inflation, just curious if that's really specific to grocery and what you're seeing from your vendors there in terms of price increases, it sounds like your customers are not really seeing that. But maybe can you just elaborate on what you're seeing and what categories you are seeing inflation or deflation?","Doug McMillon","I don't think we should get too specific by category. I think I would just say that the combination of cost pressures that we're feeling with the price reductions that we're making has worked out in a way that the customers are not feeling very much impacted.","Brett Biggs","And our merchants -- it changes every year, but our merchants are always working through something that's inflating, something that's deflating. They're really good at managing mix in various different situations.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Karen Short ","Hi, thanks. Just looking at U.S. in the fourth quarter, obviously I mean it was a very impressive leverage number. And I guess what I'm asking is, when I look through 2020, I guess, I don't really see anything that changes the cadence on the gross margin decline, if anything, maybe it gets a little bit easier because you lap transport?","And then it seems like you kind of hit your stride on the expense leverage. So is 4Q kind of something we should expect in terms of the composition going forward because of those numbers are finally getting you to that tipping point where you can see past the Flipkart dilution, I guess?","Brett Biggs ","I'll speak first specifically to the U.S. because I think that was the main question. We're really seeing the productivity loop back in action in Walmart U.S. where you get the sales and it allows you to do what we want to do in prices, allows you to lower expenses. The productivity loop is alive and well in the U.S. The mix of our business continues to change as you look at eCommerce growing in the U.S., the acquisition of Flipkart and so that does change when you look at the total company.","But as for leverage, I mentioned from a total company perspective, we expect to slightly lever-in Q1 and that just to get progressively better as we get through -- those through the year and we certainly couldn't do that or couldn't make that statement if we didn't feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in the U.S..","Again we've assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage. Sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage. But that's how we see the year playing out.","Karen Short ","Okay, that's helpful. And my second question is just on eCommerce. I guess, I was wondering if there was anything about the fourth quarter, I guess that surprised you on eCommerce in terms of either losses, well specifically losses. But I also was just wondering if you could give us an update on a number of SKUs -- total number of SKUs both 1P and then 3P. And then maybe just little a update on the mirroring of SKUs that your -- FCs because it seems to me that that's also one of the things that will help from the losses that is going a little slower than expected?","Doug McMillon","Karen, this is Doug, I think that's right. We're making good progress on mirroring. And our total count is in the 75 million range now. There wasn't anything that I can think of that really surprised us in the fourth quarter as it relates to e-commerce. I would mention that you may remember a year ago we had some fulfillment center challenges and the team did a great job of preparing for peak and executing it this year and the customer experience was a lot better. So I was really pleased to see that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Robbie Ohmes ","Thanks. Just another follow-up on e-commerce. So you guys called out doubling delivery again this year. Can you, maybe Doug, remind us how you guys are executing that? Who the key partners are? And maybe how the math is working on that? How do you make that leverageable, is there any scale opportunity there?","Doug McMillon ","Sure. Hi Robbie. We're using a combination of last mile solutions. We're using cloud source companies and we have our own platform that's called Spark that we're experimenting with and we're still playing around with some associate deliveries in a small way trying to figure that out. But it's the crowd source delivery platforms they're really helping us achieve scale.","Generally speaking, the delivery cost cover the cost and we right now are operating with something like breakeven mentalities it relates to delivery cost, so customers are bearing that. But they really do like the convenience and I'm excited about figuring all this out. And the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers, which by the way is helping keep pressure on in stocks which is what we saw from the UK years ago, really like that healthy pressure together with pickup, which continues to have a high NPS score and people love it.","Now, with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited. It looks to me like there's a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience, so it looks promising.","Robbie Ohmes","That sounds great. And just a follow-up question for you. I think in the presentation on China, you called that intensifying competition and I think also just mentioned slower growth overall in China. Can you just maybe fill us in on what you guys are seeing in China with the consumer overall over there?","Doug McMillon","If you just read the headlines, you might imagine things are pretty tough, but that's not really what we're seeing. And if you look at our comp performance, Brett talked about a calendar change, but that aside, things have held up pretty well and the Sam's Clubs continue to be a really strong. I'm excited about the fact we've got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in Sam's is great. The supercenters have been performing better and they look better. I think operationally we've improved. ","And then we've been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there which can play a key role in last mile delivery. This relationship that we mentioned on last mile, they are resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery which is still think around of $1 and the speed with which it can get delivered given the density of the market is incredible. So that feels, okay. And I think if you look at the overall relationship considering all the things are happening in China, we're in pretty good shape. So, I'm still, I'm optimistic and recognize the tremendous opportunity that market has and we're constantly trying to think through our position in that market and how we might improve it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Seth Sigman","Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I want to follow-up on the online grocery conversation. So I think you said that you're going to add another 1,000 stores this year. I'm curious more about how the ramp curve in the new stores maybe changing, as you see growth in consumer interest and awareness of the offering.","And then, the second piece of the question on the topic of mix. I think when you purchase something through the Online Grocery app, you can actually add things outside of just grocery. I'm just curious, are you seeing any major change in mix there in the context of maybe improving profitability over time? Thanks.","Doug McMillon","I think, two dimensions there. One is the customer enthusiasm for those kinds of offers. And it's a loud and clear to us that customers, no surprise, are really busy. And that, if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pick up and delivery, they're all over it. So, I think, the ramp there in terms of how our comp stores will behave in addition to the roll out that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back-to-school. So that includes a lot of items that are not food items.","And then, over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs our go to pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food.","So we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that will help mix over time. And we may have seen that already, I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that that basket would change shape and the profitability would look better.","Seth Sigman","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one follow-up question on the inventory growth, up 0.8% on a comp basis in the U.S., I think the first time in the recent memory. Strength of sales, obviously, very clear, but anything else to highlight there that maybe driving that?","Doug McMillon","At first, I would say, the job that Greg and the team have done on the inventory over last few years has been phenomenal. I mean, being a merchant for so much of my career, I have so much respect for the way that they have driven in-stock levels, reduced inventory, reduce deletive inventory for quarter-after-quarter now.","What happened in this case is that we saw the SNAP shift into the end of January. We build food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure that we were maximizing that opportunity. And there's a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worse case scenario, but we certainly hope and expect that that won't happen. So I'm not worried about inventory level. It's high quality and there's a bit of timing difference there and overall that picture still looks really good.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So if we look at the midpoint of your U.S. comp guidance, it's 2.5% to 3% for 2020. It's about 100 basis points below what you achieved in 2019. Should we take that to mean that's what you think the healthy spending environment driven in part by all the tax reform, contributed to your sales in the year-ago period, at about 100 basis points?","Doug McMillon","I think that's exactly right. I think we're just recognizing that this last year had some tailwinds and that this year we won't have.","Brett Biggs","Yeah. Obviously, there is some more challenging comparisons because of what we did this year, but I think what Doug's saying on healthy economic environment, you put a number of things together. I think this is the range that we feel good about going into the year. But still obviously a very, very healthy growth.","Michael Lasser","My follow-up question is on Flipkart. How much is the regulatory environment going to influence your investment posture in that market? So if we see no change and the competition eases up. Are you going to look to maybe moderate your investments in the end market over time?","Brett Biggs","So I think we'll see how the year goes and respond appropriately. But I would remind everybody that Flipkart is already an ecosystem. There's the PhonePe, a payment platform. There's a last mile delivery. There's a Myntra and Jabong businesses in apparel. So it's not just one thing. And it's just not an eCommerce business in the traditional sense, there's a lot of dimension to it. So there just like here we've got a lot of different variables we can play what demands the total. And I think we've forecasted it appropriately and we'll respond as the year goes on.","Doug McMillon","Michael, when you look at, I mean, all the reasons we cited for going into India acquiring Flipkart when you look at the continued eCommerce growth in India, the size of the market, the growing middle class, all those things are still as true today as they were six months ago. So the reasons we're excited about the market are still there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Good morning. A lot of our data is showing really great adoption of curbside grocery pickup as well as satisfaction here as well. What are your thoughts on how incrementality is unfolding?","Also as this continues to be a very popular and widespread service, what's the future in terms of packing and taking in labor as you balance, just making sure your in-store experience is very good for those who aren't using curbside and also leveraging what you can with automation and robotics to optimize the total experience?","Doug McMillon","Good questions, Oliver. I think the mix of new customers in online grocery is positive and encouraging to us. It's not just existing customer using the service. So that's an exciting development.","And as it relates to productivity, we're continuing to learn how to pick more efficiently using the apps and the tools that you've seen in the stores plus we've got a few experiments going on with more automation to try and solve for future higher volumes.","You can get to a point and we do cap in some store locations, a place where we have too many pickers in the store and it gets -- they get in the way of our customer shopping and site counter so we got to manage that effectively. And we had a Salem, a project alert. I forgot what we call it. AlphaBot maybe. The announcement that we made last year that's one to keep an eye on. But we're actively sorting out how to increase our in stocks, increase productivity and how the customer experience, continue to improve from an NPS point of view that will be an ongoing stream of work.","Brett Biggs","And we're learning from the stores that were early in the process as they get larger and larger we're able to take those learnings from those stores that have been in the system a little longer to stores that are just coming online.","Oliver Chen","Well, Brett on the topic of curbside, how are you thinking about ROIC and payback and as you make judgments you're rapidly rolling this out and people like it. But I'm curious about your thoughts on the multi-year and the investment versus the long-term share gains as well as customer reception?","Brett Biggs","I do think about ROI a lot. You're correct. I -- when we're together as a team, I am talking about Doug's team, we spend as you can imagine most of our time thinking through the prioritization of the various things that are going on inside the company and as we go through those discussions, we always have the P&L and the balance sheet and ROI in front of us as part of those discussions. And it's our job as the management team to make these things work together over time. The customer acceptance, we're seeing with online grocery in particular is a one where you look at it and say we are going to lean into this. And there maybe things along the line and we delay this or can we stop something else, but we're going to lean into things like this and see when we see them working for the customer and as a team we will ensure that it works out for our shareholders over the mid to long term.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I have one kind of just shop keeping item with the discrete items in the fourth quarter. I'm trying to understand comparability, I think it's 47 point leverage we had in the U.S. business is that including or excluding the discrete items and if it's inclusive, how many basis points were the discrete items?","Doug McMillon ","Yeah. Scott, we had mentioned and that we've of course you've just heard it for the first time, we mentioned in the script that we -- that leverage is higher than it would normally be because of those discrete items. Last year, if you back those out, we still levered slightly in the quarter and for the year. But, clearly, fourth quarter was higher than you would normally expect because of those discrete items.","Scott Mushkin ","So there was just slight and would U.S. EBIT have grown without the discrete items?","Brett Biggs ","I am sorry, what did you say, Scott? I missed the question.","Scott Mushkin ","Would U.S. EBIT have grown without the discrete items?","Brett Biggs ","It would have been roughly flat.","Scott Mushkin ","Roughly flat. Okay. Great. Then my second question is regarding just kind of the strategy in the U.S. I mean, it seems like if I back away a little bit you guys talked about omni-channel pressuring probably little bit more seems like the international business is pressuring a little bit more. If I kind of add those things up, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of wiggle room to invest a lot in price in the U.S. Am I missing that? Or is that how you would frame it as well?","Brett Biggs ","Scott, I think we've got enough room. As you know, we've been on a multi-year plan to reduce pricing in the U.S. and we're just continuing that. There are some price investments in Sam's and in some international markets, but I'm comfortable. When you look at our forecast that we've got an appropriately aggressive price investment remaining as we finish-off what we started years ago.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and good quarter. Just wanted to maybe touch on guidance. Certainly, you are reiterating fiscal 2020 just given the moving parts in the business. But maybe just a little more detail around the cadence of the guide. Specifically, I think in 1Q, you mentioned, operating income to be down 10%. Just to what extent is that Flipkart versus currency? Or how should we think about the top line headwinds from SNAP or tax refunds? Just one going kind of cadence and improvement you expect to see over the balance of the year. What does that come from?","Brett Biggs","Yes, Paul this is Brett. So, if you look at the cadence -- primarily what you are seeing in Q1 is going to be related to Flipkart. If you look at the guidance we've given last year and just look at how that would play out over the quarter, you can get pretty quickly to that number.","There's always going to the timing of other parts of the business they go from one quarter to another based on how expenses are flowing, but that's the biggest part of Q1 and Q2 as well because it did not come in our results until partway through Q3. There's always -- we can have things move around between quarters $50 million here $60 million there and it can make a difference in how that number looks from a profitability standpoint, but Flipkart is the biggest part of that next year.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then as we look toward fiscal 2020, just your outlook on transportation expenses and the headwind there? And what you're seeing also on the wage front?","Doug McMillon ","On the wage side, Paul, we've just been moving up market-by-market. Our average now is about $17.50 for an hourly associate in the U.S. and I'm comfortable that we've got appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need baked into the plan.","Transportation costs, I'm not really close to what's happening right now. I would expect based on what's happening with the drivers if we're going to be better shape from a transportation point of view as we go through the year. And it is helpful that gas prices are in the range that they are in and hope that continues to be the case. I think that's one of the things that benefited this last year. So, glad to see them where they are.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Kelly","Yes, hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question actually on price investments. So, there has been some early signs I guess that food inflation beginning to couple a bit. And I'm just as curious as to what your thoughts are on allowing inflation to flow through, if they were to continue to strengthen? I guess as you think about that, right, holding the line would require a potential I guess incremental investment above what's planned. Is that something you'd be willing to do? Just help us understand how you think about the dynamic of food price inflation versus universe's price investment and what's budgeted for the year?","Doug McMillon","Before I mention I just want to clarify what I mentioned earlier, $17.50 is actually $17.55 is the average hourly associate number with wages and benefits. As it relates to pricing, I think, as I mentioned earlier, we got an appropriately aggressive plan baked in. And it would depend on what happened with competition and the severity of the price increases. I think we would manage margins as we bring all these variables together. And don't anticipate having a lot more inflation on the food side and on the non-food side, we're continuing to experience deflation in that part of the basket, kind of works out.","Edward Kelly","And then just one follow-up going on online grocery, pickup and delivery. How are you thinking about the end goal here? Is it one to two-hour delivery for our customers? How do you think about the cost to get where you want to go and how it impacts the timeframe around eventually improving e-commerce losses?","Doug McMillon","I think we'll end up in a position where the customer can pick depending on the occasion, how they want to shop. There will be families that come into stores once-a-week or twice-a-month or whatever and they'll also use pickup, they'll also use delivery, and we'll have the ability to serve them in all those ways. There's an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended. You can decouple speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs, so as the volume goes up and density improves. We'll try to figure out how to drive a basket business it looks more like dense route than a one-hour or a 30-minute race to deliver to somebody's house.","That maybe different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery. It seems like those use cases are different enough. So we've got some tests going on and real-time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them. And it's kind of one more mix opportunity for us. We grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we're managing a service mix. And the good news is that once customers are in your ecosystem, they'll use you in some way as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, you get the opportunity to expand on that relationship and that's what we're trying to do.","Brett Biggs","Scott, I want to, this is Brett. I want to come back and clear myself. I said that U.S. income, U.S. operating income ex one items was flat. I misspoken that it was up a little bit in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Edward Yruma","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess two quick ones. First on macro. Obviously less tailwinds this year, but are you starting to see any changes in consumer behavior that would indicate that we're starting to level off or seeing some deterioration. And I guess as a follow-up you're running a dual time strategy with the Jet, I guess how would you score your kind of Jet business and serving those urban millennials? Thank you.","Brett Biggs","Edward, this is Brett, I'll start off. In the consumer, I think it feels pretty good to us. You see all the numbers that we see, wages are still pretty good, unemployment rate's low, gas prices are down year-on-year. So, there's a number of things I think are still working in favor of the consumer. Like you mentioned we're watching it as we always do. We're monitoring it, and making sure that we're in the right place with the customer. I think no matter of the environment, we tend to do pretty well and are able to react and be there for those customers, but we're monitoring it as we always do.","Doug McMillon","The first quarter is always a challenge, because you got an Easter change, there's weather that's a little more impactful than it's volatility. We got the SNAP moving into the first quarter, the tax rebates, I mean different windows of times, sometimes, they are concentrated in a few days, sometimes they are spread out over a week. So it makes it exciting to manage Q1. But underneath all that, I'll agree with what Brett said they're in pretty good shape.","On Jet I'm really pleased with the role that it's playing, attracting new brands. And our focus as we mentioned before is on urban markets. So it's an opportunity to learn and to try new items and different items in some cases that we have at wallmart.com so that's the role it's playing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Grom","Hey thanks. Good morning and great quarter here. Just one near-term question, Brett. Do you guys expect that 40 basis points SNAP benefit to reverse in the first quarter? And then long-term question just with regard to digital, when you think about 2019 losses being greater than 2018. Would you expect the 2019 losses to be the peak based on what you know now?","And then as a follow-up to that when you think about mix being issue, when you think about correcting that you guys were pretty active a couple of years ago acquiring more of the digitally native brands. Do you feel like you need to do more of that to sort of fix that issue?","Brett Biggs","Chuck, there's a lot in that question. I'll take the first two and then I'll hand off to Doug. On the SNAP benefits, I mean we are clear you know that, we believe that it did pull forward some into the fourth quarter. Again with all the things that happened in the first quarter, I think we did pull that forward, but there's other things that can potentially make up for that, but that's why we've given the quarterly guidance any quarter it can be kind of 2.5% and 3%, 2.5%-3.5% for the year.","On the eCommerce loss guidance where we've said that we expect losses to be a little more in this next year, we're not going to give guidance past that which I think probably won't surprise you. Doug you want to talk about the...","Doug McMillon","Yes, preserving flexibility there, I think it's important, we have never let a digital transformation at this scale before. So we're figuring this out as we go. But if there's an opportunity to be more aggressive given the total balance of the business, I mean we would be thinking about that.","Adding digital brands we're after assortment, we're after a repetitive customer relationship. And we're looking constantly at various acquisitions. And I think what you've seen from us in the past will continue to some extent. It's impossible to predict the pace of it or the number. So we'll just have to see at the end of the year how it will work out.","Dan Binder","Okay. That will conclude our Q&A session and our call today. We thank you for your time and interest in Walmart.","Doug McMillon","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Today's conference has concluded. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call.","Carol Schumacher","Hi, this is Carol Schumacher, vice president of investor relations for Walmart Stores, Inc.  Thanks for joining us today for our our earnings call to review the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Our press release and full transcript of this call are is available on our website, www.stock.walmart.com.","Mike Duke, president and CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc., will provide his thoughts about the quarter and some of his thoughts about his recent interactions with our customers.  Jeff Davis, EVP of finance and treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details.  Then we\u2019ll go to the operating segments: Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S. first; then Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart International; and then Roz Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will round out that section.","Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will discuss our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns, and he\u2019ll also provide Q2 guidance. A quick reminder about our guidance conventions: We update our full year EPS guidance only when we release Q2 earnings, so you\u2019ll hear that information in August, not today. Today, we will provide you Q2 guidance for both EPS and our U.S. segment comps.","Let me also remind you about our comp sales calendar. Our comp week begins on Saturday and ends on Friday. During fiscal 2014, we will report comp store sales on a 53-week basis, with 4-5-5 reporting in Q4. Because we didn\u2019t observe the 53-week retail calendar last year, our comp calendar for Q1 began on Saturday, January 26 and ended on Friday, April 26, 2013.","Last year also included an extra day for leap year, so this year\u2019s fiscal calendar for Q1 includes one less day.","Additional information regarding some of the terms we use at Walmart, including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are available on our website. Please note that this year, we no longer have discontinued operations. But we do have one new term we\u2019d like you to make note of.  \u201cCorporate and support\u201d is now what we call our corporate areas, including core corporate, such as finance and legal, as well as global ecommerce and global leverage services. Previously, we referred to this as \u201cother unallocated.\u201d","Our annual meeting of shareholders will be held at 7 a.m. central time on Friday, June 7 at the University of Arkansas campus in Fayetteville. The meeting also is available via webcast through our website - again, that\u2019s stock.walmart.com - or via Walmart\u2019s free IR app.","So now, let\u2019s get to the results, Mike.","Mike Duke","Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone.  Walmart grew first quarter diluted earnings per share 4.6% to $1.14. In a quarter marked by considerable headwinds to top line sales, we delivered solid EPS growth.","Frankly, we had a more difficult quarter than expected when we announced our guidance in February. It\u2019s important to note that Walmart U.S. continued to gain market share across several key categories. Sales were pressured primarily by delayed tax refunds, which caused customers to put off discretionary purchases. And though no one likes to talk about weather, it was a real factor across the United States. In fact, right here in Northwest Arkansas, we had the latest snowfall in the history of Arkansas reporting.","I\u2019m pleased that Bill and his team managed through these headwinds to deliver almost $67 billion in sales and leverage. This disciplined expense management allowed Walmart U.S. to deliver solid operating profit, despite the pressure on sales. I share Bill\u2019s optimism about the remainder of the year and believe the underlying strength of the Walmart U.S. business will deliver positive comps next quarter.","Now let me share some additional key metrics for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion, which excluded $1 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively flat, and we are committed to achieving leverage for the full year. We are proud that our U.S. operating segments leveraged operating expenses. We generated $6.5 billion of consolidated operating income, an increase of 1.1%.","As you know, I like to visit customers in their local markets around the world. I recently traveled to stores throughout South America and the U.S. It\u2019s gratifying to see how important EDLP is for our customers. Our mission is simple and focused: to help people save money so they can live better. ","When we simplify and focus our execution against this mission, it\u2019s easy for our associates to prioritize what they have to do. Listening to our customers ensures we deliver the merchandise they want and the experience they expect. We also evaluate how our daily decisions support our EDLC and EDLP priorities. This is our opportunity to get even better at being Walmart.","Our customers also remind me how they are integrating technology into their shopping occasions. Our goal is to make their shopping experience seamless, and we have fantastic talent delivering a number of innovative solutions to enhance their experience. ","When I recently visited our ecommerce teams in San Bruno, California and in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I witnessed the tremendous quality of talent in our ecommerce organization. I have no doubt that we are making the right investments in this space to differentiate ourselves and become a better Walmart. And with ecommerce sales growing more than 30% in the first quarter versus last year, these investments are paying off.","Turning now to Sam\u2019s Club, Sam\u2019s delivered a positive comp for the first quarter. You\u2019ll hear more from Roz about our nationwide membership fee increase rollout that was announced yesterday and how Sam\u2019s is also driving member value through improved merchandise assortment and in-club marketing.","Walmart International\u2019s constant currency sales expanded 5.4%, while on a reported basis, net sales were up 2.9%. We grew market share in a number of our markets despite headwinds from difficult economic conditions across several markets and weather. Online sales in the U.K. and Brazil were strong. Our focus remains on bringing Walmart\u2019s low prices to customers in all of our markets, and the transition to EDLP continues in key markets like Brazil and China.","We are, however, disappointed in our expense control in international. As you know, we have put a lot of emphasis on the importance of leveraging expenses as a company, and Doug and his team are taking actions in each country to improve our cost management and expand on a number of productivity initiatives. I\u2019m pleased that, overall, Walmart International made progress on managing inventory this quarter.","Across our segments, improving new store productivity is a priority. We have a more diligent process for reviewing grand opening performance, and we\u2019re taking immediate actions to strengthen sales where they\u2019re needed. And, as we discussed last year, we slowed the pace of store openings within selected International markets.","Our corporate and support costs increased this quarter due to investments in leverage initiatives and global ecommerce support, as well as higher compliance-related expenses. Jeff and Charles will provide more details on the financials behind these investments. ","In the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our compliance programs around the world. We\u2019re working closely with third party anti-corruption compliance experts to review and to assess the programs in our international markets and to partner with us on anticorruption support and training. Beyond anticorruption, our comprehensive global compliance review continues in all of our markets to evaluate and reinforce our procedures and our programs applicable to 14 compliance areas, including licenses and permits, food safety, and ethical sourcing, among others.","Walmart continues to make strides on the issues that matter to our customers. I was honored to stand with First Lady Michelle Obama recently to pledge Walmart\u2019s support of the \u201cJoining Forces\u201d initiative to benefit our U.S. military veterans and their families. On Memorial Day, we will begin a program to hire recent, honorably-discharged U.S. veterans. We\u2019re proud of this initiative and appreciate the partnership of other large companies that are joining us in providing employment opportunities to these worthy Americans.","As I close my remarks, I\u2019d like to reiterate that I\u2019m confident about our long-term strategy and the direction that Walmart is headed. We didn\u2019t have the first quarter performance we wanted as a company, due partly to various external factors and also the comparison to last year\u2019s great first quarter. You\u2019ll hear the specifics about why we feel better about our U.S. businesses\u2019 performance for the second quarter. ","This, coupled with more discipline in international and our investments in strategic initiatives, will allow us to improve our performance throughout the year. Our commitment to Walmart\u2019s mission to save people money so that they can live better benefits our customers and our shareholders alike.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff for more financial details.  Jeff?  ","Jeff Davis","Thank you, Mike.  As you just heard, Walmart reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.14 versus $1.09 last year.  Recall last year end, we stated the company\u2019s continued investment in ecommerce initiatives would negatively impact our fiscal 2014 diluted EPS by an incremental $0.09. Consequently, our first quarter results were unfavorably impacted by these initiatives by approximately $0.02.","Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $113.4 billion. I would like to remind you that the first quarter of last year included an extra day due to leap year and added approximately 100 basis points to net sales. Separately, first quarter net sales included $200 million from an acquisition and were also impacted by $1 billion of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 1.8% to $114.2 billion.","With respect to comp sales for the quarter, total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 1.2%. Bill and Roz will provide more details in a minute.  Membership and other income increased 1.6% compared to the first quarter last year. Please stay tuned to hear more from Roz regarding our recent advancements in club membership.","Total revenue for the first quarter was $114.2 billion, a 1% increase over last year. This was on top of a strong 8.5% increase at this time last year.  Gross profit increased 1.2%, primarily driven by supply chain productivity and merchandise mix within our U.S. business segments. The gross profit rate was relatively flat to last year.","Now, turning to expenses, our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.1%, which is relatively flat to last year. As you heard from Mike, our U.S. businesses leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. And you\u2019ll hear more from Doug on the international team\u2019s focus to reduce expenses for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at corporate and support expenses. Corporate and support is comprised of core corporate, global ecommerce support, and global leverage services.","Total corporate and support expenses increased approximately $200 million or 44.4%. Our core corporate expenses increased 37.2%, including $73 million in expenses related to FCPA matters, which was above our forecasted range of $40 to $45 million. ","Approximately $44 million of the expenses represent costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while $29 million covers costs regarding the global compliance review, program enhancements, and organizational changes. Excluding the FCPA matters, core corporate increased by approximately 14.6%.","The remainder of the corporate and support growth is primarily associated with global leverage services. This increase is the result of investments to enhance enterprise information management, build global capabilities, and leverage scale. Though we will continue to invest in these areas, we expect these expenses to moderate for the remainder of the fiscal year.","This leads us to consolidated operating income, which grew 1.1% to $6.5 billion, slightly ahead of sales growth.  Net interest expense for the quarter decreased 0.9% to $530 million, as we continue to avail ourselves of low interest rate funding. And, consolidated net income attributable to Walmart increased 1.1% to $3.8 billion.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was 33.4%, essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last year. Full year guidance for fiscal 2014 effective tax rate continues to be between 32% and 33%. As a reminder, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","Now turning to our balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 4.5%, primarily driven by our U.S. operations. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth.","Payables as a percentage of inventory was 85.2%, which compares to 89.8% last year. This decrease was primarily the result of increased levels of inventory within our U.S. segments and the timing of disbursements.","Our debt to total capitalization was 44.8% at the end of the quarter, compared to 44.2% last year. During the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow versus $3.1 billion last year. An increase in income tax payments due primarily to changes in federal bonus depreciation rules and an increase in capital expenditures contributed to the free cash flow decline.","Moving on to returns, for the quarter, the company returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 30 million shares at a cost of $2.2 billion. As of April 30, we have approximately $1.5 billion remaining under our current $15 billion authorization.","To wrap up, return on investment, or ROI, for the trailing 12 months ended April 30, 2013 was 17.8%, compared to 18.1% last year. This reduction was primarily the result of acquisitions and an increase in fixed assets within our base business.","Now let\u2019s turn it over to our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S.  Bill?","Bill Simon","Thank you, Jeff. When we last spoke to you in February, we shared that the first quarter had gotten off to a very slow start, essentially due to the delay in tax refund checks. When we provided flat comp guidance for the first quarter, we had expected, among other things, to recover a reasonable portion of these tax refunds and had also assumed that customers would follow historical spending patterns with these funds. This did not materialize as we had anticipated.","Similar to what you\u2019ve heard from companies in various industries that have reported earnings, top line revenue was challenged by a number of issues. These included a $9 billion reduction in IRS estimated tax refunds versus last year, and we cashed less in income tax refunds than the prior year. Additionally, the 2% increase in payroll taxes reduced inflation and some of the most unfavorable spring weather we\u2019ve seen in recent years across much of the country impacted our business.","While we don\u2019t generally like talking about weather, it certainly had an impact. Weather sensitive departments like outdoor living, sporting goods, air movement and apparel were challenged, particularly from mid-March to mid-April, when weather was much less favorable than last year. However, there were bright spots. Where weather was fairly normal, in Florida for example, we had positive comps for the quarter.","In addition, as we gave guidance last quarter, we expected an increase in the level of grocery inflation, but it did not materialize in a meaningful way. We experienced very modest inflation, much lower than last year, and in fact, we had some deflation in areas like dry grocery.","We estimate that the factors discussed earlier affected our comp sales by as much as 200 basis points in the first quarter versus our expectations. Primarily driven by these factors, we ended the quarter with a lower comp than expected at a negative 1.4%, compared to a strong positive 2.6% comp last year. Traffic was down 1.8%, while ticket was up 0.4%. However, excluding the first two weeks of the quarter, comp sales were relatively flat and traffic improved.","Despite sales being lower than expected, I\u2019m really proud of the work done by all of our associates during the quarter. The team did an excellent job managing the business, taking care of our customers and bringing in a solid profit result, with operating income increasing 5.9%.","We also continued to gain market share across several categories. According to the Nielsen Company, we gained 20 basis points of market share in the measured category of \u201cfood, consumables and health and wellness\/OTC\u201d during the 13 weeks ending April 27, 2013.  As of now, we\u2019re encouraged by the start of sales in the second quarter because we\u2019ve seen more normalized weather and we\u2019re getting past the main effects of the reduced tax refunds.","Now let\u2019s cover the financial details of the first quarter. Net sales were up $220 million, or 0.3%, to $66.6 billion. Last year\u2019s leap day added approximately 100 basis points of net sales to first quarter fiscal \u201813. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $18.2 billion, with gross profit rate increasing 10 basis points from the previous year, partly driven by supply chain productivity and cost of goods savings initiatives. ","We continued to leverage these initiatives, targeting specific areas of our grocery business, providing savings to our customers in the first quarter. These actions, along with our ability to leverage expenses, enabled us to further strengthen our position as the price leader in the market.","Our commitment to the productivity loop is a long-term, sustainable strategy. We will continue to be strategic about price investments, monitoring competitor price gaps, market share, and other data to ensure we maintain an appropriate balance between price investments and margin.","Our strategy is based on an everyday low cost structure. For the quarter, the team did a good job managing expenses, contributing 32 basis points of expense leverage. Although a large part of the leverage was driven by a decline in incentive expense versus historically high levels last year, every part of the organization was focused on operating for less, from our distribution centers and transportation fleet, to each one of our stores. Together, we reduced expenses by 1.3% versus last year, driving a 5.9% increase in operating income.","For the quarter, inventory was up 4.6%, driven partly by an expanded assortment in some merchandise areas, in addition to challenging weather, which created headwinds for some seasonal categories. We feel good about our current inventory position as the weather improves and customers get ready for summer.","Before I discuss the performance of our merchandising areas, I\u2019d like to spend some time covering a few things we\u2019re doing from an operational perspective that helped drive our quarterly performance.","Our logistics team continues to be a key contributor to our results by generating savings that benefit our leverage goals and gross margin. In the first quarter, the team continued to improve processes within our supply chain. This enabled us to transport 3.1% additional cases per mile driven, helping us to reduce the overall cost per case shipped versus last year. Our results in logistics, quarter after quarter, are proof that our strategy is sustainable.","Within our stores, we continued to fine tune our technology investments, including self-service checkouts and work assignment tools, like MyGuide. These initiatives drove another quarter of solid gains in productivity, as our management teams work toward continuous improvement.","We continued to expand our self-service checkouts in the first quarter, with about 38% more stores in service versus last year. In general, customer response has been positive, with utilization across the chain up over 300 basis points year over year. ","In the back rooms, projects like MyGuide and OneTouch also enabled improvements in stocker productivity by helping to facilitate the process of moving merchandise from the truck to the shelf and prioritizing work for our associates. In the first quarter, these initiatives contributed to an increase of over 3% in cases handled per work hour.","We\u2019re focused on driving productivity by implementing initiatives that make work simpler for our associates and enhance our customer experience. As you might expect from Walmart, there are a number of metrics we monitor to ensure strong operational execution, including customer line lengths, customer experience scores, and merchandise in-stock levels. While we always strive to improve, we\u2019re pleased overall with our current performance against these metrics.","Now let\u2019s review the performance of the various merchandising areas.  Grocery, which includes food and consumables, generated a low single-digit positive comp on relatively flat inflation, a much lower inflation rate than last year. ","In food, we\u2019ve made great progress in the quality of our fresh departments, and I\u2019m particularly excited about the momentum in the produce area. We\u2019ve improved our process for handling and culling produce, allowing us to get the freshest assortment in front of our customers. In the first quarter, we started to see the positive results, evidenced by a mid single-digit positive comps in produce and market share gains for the 13 weeks ended on March 30, according to Nielsen.","In consumables, we also continued to gain market share across most departments. And I\u2019m particularly encouraged to see customers respond to our price investment strategy, evidenced by the Nielsen data that shows noticeably higher market share gains in areas where we invested in price in the first quarter. Overall, our performance in consumables was mostly driven by the \u201ceveryday need\u201d categories.","Health and wellness generated a low single-digit negative comp. While units were up, we experienced the largest brand-to-generic impact to date, coupled with an overall increase in generic versus brand sales. While our Rx business was pressured by the brand-to-generic impact, we continued to see strength in OTC, with solid comp sales and market share gains, according to Nielsen. Also noteworthy is our performance in the core, non-seasonal categories like vitamins, analgesics, and antacids, which delivered a mid single-digit positive comp for the quarter.","Hard lines, which includes our seasonal business, posted a low single-digit negative comp. Weather significantly impacted sporting goods categories like fishing and camping in the first quarter, with non-weather impacted categories like stationery and crafts delivering positive comps.","Stationery and crafts was driven by strong growth in needlecraft, paints, and other indoor categories. Our new assortment is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our gains in market share across several of our stationery categories for the three-month period ending April 6, according to The NPD Group. ","Comps in our seasonal business were also positive, driven by solid growth in Valentine\u2019s Day and Easter, with strong results in gifts, d\u00e9cor and party ware. We continue to be a destination for the holidays, providing our customers with one-stop-shop solutions to stock up for the big events of the year.","Entertainment, including toys, had a mid single-digit negative comp. Softer discretionary spending impacted entertainment and created even more significant headwinds for higher ticket electronics like TVs. ","On the other hand, our wireless business again delivered a double-digit positive comp, with Straight Talk sales hitting a record high in the first quarter. Let me remind you how we are reporting sales of wireless. Reporting convention calls for sales of Straight Talk and third-party gift cards such as iTunes and restaurant cards to be included in sales, net of the product cost. In other words, we only account for a commission on sales. ","We continued to make great strides for our customers in the wireless space, providing a broad selection of affordable solutions. According to NPD, Walmart became the number one retailer in handset unit share for the three months ending March 31, 2013.","In toys, similar to the rest of the business, we experienced softness in outdoor categories like spring toys and bicycles, which was partly offset by strength in educational and preschool toys. ","Apparel reported a low single-digit negative comp for the quarter, mostly driven by soft demand for spring categories. I\u2019m pleased with the work of the team in apparel and particularly encouraged by the performance of our basics offering, which delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Kids and accessories were also positive in the first quarter, benefitting from assortment improvements. We\u2019ve made great progress in this area and will continue to focus on quality throughout the year to drive results.","In home, pronounced softness in outdoor living impacted the performance, driving the business to a mid single-digit negative comp. Our results were significantly better in areas of the country less impacted by weather. In the Pacific division, for instance, outdoor living delivered a high single-digit positive comp in the first quarter. ","In indoor living categories, we continued to work on assortment, making national brands like Rachel Ray affordable for our customers and delivering a low single-digit positive comp in cooking and dining. Our customers are shopping our home aisles, evidenced by our gains in market share across the business, according to NPD.","Other areas of the business where we\u2019re gaining momentum are walmart.com and mobile. We continue to drive integration with our stores to deliver a seamless customer experience. In the first quarter, we continued to test the mobile self-checkout option \u201cScan and Go,\u201d expanding it across more than 200 stores in 14 different regions. ","We\u2019re encouraged by the early results, with the majority of \u201cScan & Go\u201d customers using the feature multiple times. The team is constantly making improvements, and we\u2019ll soon be testing digital coupons and gift cards with \u201cScan and Go\u201d. We also announced we\u2019ll be testing self-service lockers in select stores this summer. The goal of the program is to reduce the wait time for Site to Store orders, providing customers with an anywhere, anytime pickup solution.","We\u2019re also very excited about the opportunity to grow the Ship from Store program. You\u2019ve heard us talk about the power of our physical footprint and how we plan to utilize our presence across the country as an additional asset in our fulfillment network. We\u2019re pleased with the initial results and are currently shipping certain orders from 35 stores straight to customers\u2019 homes. We expanded the pilot considerably in the first quarter and will continue to expand strategically throughout the rest of the year.","Our e-commerce strategy complements a growing real estate portfolio. We\u2019re in a unique position to serve our customers whenever and wherever they want to shop, integrating our walmart.com capabilities with an expanding presence of supercenters and small formats.","In the first quarter, we added 38 new units and converted 8 units to supercenters through relocation or expansion. These 46 units added 3.6 million incremental square feet and included 1 discount store, 24 supercenters, and 21 small formats, most of which were Neighborhood Markets.","Neighborhood Markets continued their positive performance, delivering a low single-digit positive comp, primarily driven by solid traffic gains. The vast majority of Neighborhood Markets include pharmacies, providing an additional convenience for our customers and driving traffic to the store. Our optimized assortment and convenient shopping experience is resonating with the customer, evidenced by our positive comps across most of the merchandising areas.","Walmart Express also continues to generate strong results, delivering another quarter of double-digit positive comps. In the second quarter, we\u2019ll begin testing various supply chain initiatives as part of the North Carolina density test, which will strengthen our understanding of supply chain strategies for smaller stores.","During the second quarter, we\u2019re planning to open between 60 and 65 new units, including new stores, expansions, and relocations. Our second quarter forecast represents about 4 million square feet of retail space, which will put us well on our way to deliver our previous guidance of 15 to 17 million square feet of retail growth in fiscal year \u201814.","This year started with many challenges for our core customer.  Nevertheless, I\u2019m confident in our position and in the ability of our teams to execute. We believe that our strategy works under any economic environment and our underlying business remains strong.","From an operational perspective, we will continue fueling the productivity loop, improving every aspect of our operation so we can leverage expenses, invest in price, and drive results. Our price investments will be supported by a solid marketing program that will communicate our strong price leadership. Throughout the rest of the year, we\u2019ll continue expanding our local basket challenge campaign through TV and radio, covering 70% of our markets across the country.","Most important, we\u2019ll continue to run our business with our customers, our associates, and our communities in mind. Earlier this year, we announced our veterans\u2019 initiative with the objective of hiring any honorably discharged veteran seeking employment within his or her first 12 months off active duty. On Memorial Day, we\u2019ll be ready to launch the program, and we believe the vast majority of applicants will be placed within 30 days.","May is off to a good start, with positive comps. We continue to feel good about the underlying business, as evidenced by first quarter results in areas less impacted by weather, as well as by our market share gains. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the impact of the 2% payroll tax increase along with other factors, like fuel prices. Based on these factors, we forecast comp sales to increase in the range of flat to positive 2% for the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26, 2013.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Doug for an international update. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thank you, Bill.  I\u2019d like to start the update on international by reminding you of our priorities: balancing growth and returns. As you know, Walmart International is an important contributor to top line growth. During the first quarter, we delivered a respectable top line. We feel good about the net and comp sales, especially given last year\u2019s really strong first quarter, the loss of leap day, and weather issues. As a reminder, our first quarter last year was our strongest of FY 13, with international net sales on a reported basis up 15% and operating income up 21.2%.","During this year\u2019s first quarter, on a reported basis Walmart International grew net sales 2.9% to $33 billion. On a constant currency basis, Walmart International\u2019s first quarter sales were $33.8 billion, up 5.4%. A stronger dollar against key currencies impacted international results more negatively than expected and decreased the top line by $1 billion. Our acquisition increased sales by $200 million.","Our stores in the U.K., Africa, Mexico, Central America, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China, and India delivered positive comp store sales. Comp sales declined in Canada and Japan. As mentioned, last year had an extra leap day for leap year and the comparison to last year impacted sales and customer traffic by about 100 basis points.","From a relative performance point of view, we were encouraged with our market share gains around the world during the quarter. We grew our share in Canada, Africa, Chile, Argentina, Central America, China, and Japan. We maintained market share in the U.K. and Mexico. And although we did not grow overall share in Brazil, we did increase share in food and consumables.","Like revenue growth, another important priority is improving our returns. We were disappointed with our operating income performance this quarter, which impacted returns. In fact, we had a decline in profitability versus last year. This was partially due to having one less day of sales in all markets, as well as specific drivers that I\u2019ll elaborate on as I review the markets.","Operating income was $1.3 billion and decreased 4.7% on a reported basis versus last year. On a constant currency basis, operating income declined 2.4%.","Our gross profit rate was slightly down, and operating expenses grew faster than sales. Several factors contributed to us not leveraging expenses: softer sales, wage inflation, higher indirect taxes, and strategic investments, including those in e-commerce.  These are investments beyond those covered in the corporate and support budget. ","Unfortunately, in the international markets, we have less workforce flexibility than in the U.S. In many markets, it takes more time to introduce and implement productivity improvements that help us to adjust wages to sales realities. ","Given our current headwinds, I expect second quarter expenses to remain under pressure. Let me assure you that all management teams are focused on reducing expenses throughout our operating segment, and we expect to demonstrate improvement in the second half of the year.","Another priority has been inventory management. I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve seen some improvement in this quarter that was aided by Easter being one week earlier for the markets that celebrate the holiday. Constant currency inventory increased 7.1% over last year, an improvement from the first quarter last year. On a reported basis, inventory was up only 3.6%.","Now let\u2019s get into the results for our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, total sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal, calendar basis.","Let\u2019s begin with EMEA. The U.K. had a solid first quarter in a challenging market. Personal income grew much slower than the cost of essential items, putting pressure on all consumers. According to Kantar Worldpanel, the market experienced stronger growth in the first quarter than in previous quarters, driven solely by inflation, while market volumes declined. ","The U.K. market as a whole experienced significant supply integrity issues within the quarter related to meat. Asda responded by carrying out robust and rigorous testing and continues to focus on transparency for customers.  ","In the first quarter, Asda\u2019s net sales rose 2.6%, and sales excluding fuel increased 3%. Comparable sales rose by 1.3%, excluding fuel, growing ahead of the market. Average comp ticket increased by 1.6%, while comp traffic decreased by 0.3%. Asda\u2019s market share was flat at 17.9% for the 12 weeks ended March 17, the latest data reported by Kantar\u2019s Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll. A bright spot continues to be Asda\u2019s online grocery sales, which grew more than 16%.","During the quarter, Asda increased investment in reducing the price of key food essentials. As a result, Asda\u2019s internal inflation measures continued to be significantly below the market, and comparable food volumes were positive in the first quarter. Reinforcing this strategy, Asda also won the \u201cGrocer 33\u201d lowest priced supermarket for 12 of the 13 weeks in Q1.","Strong price and value gaps, combined with events such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter, and Mum\u2019s Day drove food sales growth, with Easter categories such as lamb, salmon, and bakery significantly outperforming. A January clearance event and seasonably appropriate weather drove strong general merchandise sales.","Asda\u2019s gross profit margin declined slightly in the quarter, driven by sales mix and price investment. Considering the impact of fuel sales, operating expenses grew slower than sales. The \u201cWe operate for less\u201d program continued to deliver savings, offsetting some of the cost headwinds across energy, property taxes, insurance, and environmental tariffs, along with some weather-related costs. Operating income decreased by 0.8% from the prior year.","Moving to Canada, Walmart Canada faced a challenging quarter, as consumer spending weakened due to higher household debt levels. Our results were impacted by the unseasonably colder weather this year versus unseasonably warm weather last year and the leap year overlap. Net sales grew 6.1%, but Canada had a decline in operating income and did not leverage expenses.","Comparable sales decreased 1.3%, with comp ticket up 0.7%, and comp traffic declining 2%. We had strong comp sales in food, consumables, and home lines, but continue to see softer sales in entertainment. The colder weather also impacted sales in hard lines and apparel. However, in the first quarter\u2019s challenging environment, we drove market share gains of 120 basis points and the Nielsen Company measured categories of \u201cfood, consumables, and health and wellness.\u201d","Regarding profitability, gross profit rate increased due to improved initial margins from private label and direct import gains, as well as reduced shrink. However, operating expenses grew faster than sales, primarily due to negative comp store sales, the lapping of costs related to the year-over-year growth in new store base, and investments in ecommerce.","Moving to Sub-Saharan Africa, as you know, Massmart is a publicly held company in South Africa, and only announces results every six months. For the 14 weeks ending March 31, Massmart increased sales by 10.3% and comparable sales by 6%. ","While these are good numbers, the trends are slower than we reported for Massmart at the close of fiscal 2013. The South African consumer environment remains cautious, and sales growth is forecasted to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. Also note that Massmart will hold its annual meeting on May 22nd.","Now to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex-reported numbers.","Walmex results for the first quarter were mixed. We had solid results in Central America and disappointing performance in Mexico that impacted the overall business. For the quarter, net sales grew 5.5%. Gross margin increased 60 basis points versus last year, driven by improvements in both Mexico and Central America. Operating expenses grew more than sales. Management is focused on reducing expenses and increasing productivity savings. Operating income for the quarter grew 7.5%, faster than sales, primarily due to strong gross profit margins.","For the first quarter, Mexico\u2019s sales increased 5.6% over last year and comparable store sales grew 1.1%. Average comp ticket in Mexico increased 4.4%, and comp traffic decreased 3.3% over last year. Traffic was negative due to calendar effects and a general market slowdown in consumption. In relation to the market, we maintained market share on total sales, but Mexico\u2019s first quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 0.8%. This was slower than ANTAD\u2019s comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, at 1.4%.","In Mexico, gross margin was up 48 basis points. Expenses grew 8.8%, above our sales growth. The biggest increases in expenses were in physical infrastructure investments like maintenance, repairs, and depreciation. Operating income grew 5.5%.","Central America is on track to deliver good results. Systems integration will conclude as expected in the second quarter, and markets that were lagging, like Guatemala, are improving. Central America increased net sales from the previous year by 4.9%. Comparable store sales increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 124 basis points versus last year, as a result of better merchandising and EDLP execution. The transition to EDLP in our Central American countries is completed. Expenses grew more than sales. Operating income increased 40%.","Moving on to Brazil, Brazil grew sales in the first quarter and had a slight operating profit. We continue our mantra of EDLC and EDLP, maintaining a 7% price gap in self-service formats and we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re gaining traction with customers.","First quarter retail sales in Brazil grew 5.5% from last year, with comparable sales growing 3.7%. Ticket grew 7.2%, and comp traffic declined 3.5% when compared to last year. There was strong performance in consumables, food, and perishables as we gained market share in these categories. Sales of general merchandise were weak, as we scaled down interest-free credit offerings.","Gross profit rate increased slightly, as a result of lower shrink and better markdown management, but we did not leverage operating expenses in Brazil due to our lower rate of comp store growth, specifically in our wholesale formats, and wage inflation. ","Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly-held company and will release first quarter earnings on May 30.","Moving to Asia, Walmart China grew sales and operating income during the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter grew 5.4% over last year, despite a weaker than expected Chinese New Year. Comparable store sales growth was 1%. As more Chinese families own a car and other amenities for their home, there is much greater trip consolidation. Comp ticket grew 8.9% in China, but traffic declined 7.9%. Traffic declines are consistent with the overall market.","First quarter gross profit rate was slightly down from last year due to our investment in price. However, Walmart China leveraged operating expenses, even with wage inflation. In China, we are near the end of our planning stage of our EDLP transition and have started to take a few steps. As in other markets, this is a multi-year effort, and we know it will take time for our customers to see and appreciate the value brought to them by EDLP.","On to Japan, where the economy continues to slow, Walmart Japan\u2019s net sales and comp sales decreased 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, reflecting cautious consumer behavior. First quarter comp traffic decreased 1.9% and ticket decreased 0.4%. ","Traffic decreased due to an increase in competition in the convenience related formats. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade, and Industry, or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the first quarter declined by 3.3% from last year, so on a positive note, we outperformed the market.","Walmart Japan\u2019s gross profit rate decreased by 96 basis points, due to our increased investment in lower prices. Walmart Japan missed leveraging expenses by a slight margin due to the sales decline, but year-over-year operating expenses were down, even with higher remodeling costs. Accordingly, Walmart Japan had a slight operating loss this quarter, compared to positive operating income in the prior year.","Turning to the opportunities in e-commerce, we are excited about the global capabilities we are strengthening and expanding in the key markets of the U.K., Brazil and China.  Asda\u2019s continued focus on offering a convenient shopping experience for customers drove strong online sales in the first part of 2013. ","During Q1, Asda completed the rollout of Wi-Fi across our stores to enable a better smart device shopping experience. In addition, our Asda team added its grocery Click and Collect offer in approximately 100 stores. Asda also significantly expanded grocery home shopping capacity by opening a third dedicated online fulfillment center in Nottingham, providing increased accuracy, efficiency, and delivery options. Customers now can tap into 20,000 additional delivery slots per week.","Over the last six months in Brazil, our walmart.com.br site has become the largest-traffic e-commerce site. For the first quarter, online sales in Brazil increased over 40%.","In the previous year acquisition of Yihaodian, one of the fast-growing ecommerce businesses in China, we now have a platform to compete in a market with broadband penetration that has exceeded the U.S. Yihaodian provides consumer goods on a same-day basis in Tier 1 cities: Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.","We grew market share already this year in e-commerce in the U.K., Brazil, and China, and the integration of technology into our business is a key for future growth. We will expand our successes and learnings from the U.K., Brazil, and China into other markets such Mexico, Japan, and Canada.","We are also focused on building a world-class compliance program across the globe. Our comprehensive program spans 14 different compliance dimensions that address areas from ethical sourcing to licenses and permits. We are strengthening what already existed in each market, adding subject matter expertise, significant investments in talent, process, systems, and training. ","For example, we recently announced a $16.2 million, three-year investment in food safety in China. We are reinforcing Walmart culture based on our basic beliefs of respect for the individual, strive for excellence, service to the customer, and, as always, on a foundation of integrity. With our compliance program, we will operate more effectively in each market, and we are building a solid foundation for future growth.","In closing, it\u2019s been a tough start to the beginning of the year, but we\u2019re focused in each of our markets and have tighter discipline in our execution. As Mike said earlier, we are simplifying, we are focused, and we are prioritizing. With our current outlook, we do not expect to leverage expenses in the second quarter, but we\u2019ve begun to take actions that will demonstrate improvement as we progress through the year. For example, we\u2019re working hard to accelerate the improvements that we will receive from working with our Global Business Process group.","With that, we remain focused on the core tenets of our operating model and being the best Walmart we can be. Our global consumer is challenged with their household budgets and we need to continue to provide them with the price and value they need.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s.  Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thanks, Doug.  This year, Sam\u2019s Club celebrates our 30-year anniversary. It\u2019s been an exciting journey, ever since our first club opened in Midwest City, Oklahoma in 1983. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of our associates over the past 30 years who\u2019ve delivered tremendous value to our members and made our business so successful.","During the first quarter, we grew net sales, and comp sales were within guidance. We grew membership income by delivering superior value, responding to business member trends, and enhancing our membership offering. Combined with reduced operating expenses, we generated operating profits more than 7% ahead of last year.","Comp sales, without fuel, were up 0.2% for the 13-week period, lapping a 5.3% comp sales increase last year. Comp traffic was up 1.3%, driven by our Advantage members, and ticket was down 1.1%, driven by Business members.","Unfavorable weather this year created a headwind in our weather-sensitive categories. In geographies with more moderate weather, such as the west, members responded positively to our seasonal merchandise, indicating sales in these categories improve as the weather changes. ","Additionally, inflation continued to moderate from Q4, impacting our top line results, as inflation this quarter was approximately 50 basis points. Inflation ran between 250 and 300 basis points in the first quarter last year.","Our Business member is an integral part of our business, and comp sales and traffic patterns continue to indicate that they remain pressured. Small business optimism remains at historically low levels as businesses adapt to higher payroll taxes and cautious consumers. In response, we\u2019re focused on increasing awareness of the value Sam\u2019s Club offers. We\u2019re executing regional business expos and small business appreciation programs in May and June, in which our associates spend time working with members in their place of business.","Despite these headwinds, I mentioned in the first quarter, we drove sales and profit growth. Net sales, including fuel, were $13.9 billion, up 0.1%. Fuel created a 40 basis point headwind to sales growth, as fuel prices were down 3.8% compared to last year. Gallons sold were up 1.3%. Gross profit rate was up 7 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved slightly. Operating income increased 7.4% to $525 million.","Fuel is an important component of our strategy to provide more value to our members. Volatility in fuel prices, however, can notably impact our financial results. The remainder of our discussion, therefore, will be focused on the core business and exclude fuel for comparative purposes.","Net sales for the quarter were $12.2 billion, up 0.5% from last year. During the first quarter last year, we gained one additional day due to leap year, resulting in one less day this year. The addition of leap day last year provided a benefit of about 100 basis points. Our strongest divisional performance was in the West, with our strongest regional performance in the Mountain, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions.","Now let\u2019s move on to merchandising highlights for the quarter.  Fresh comp sales were up low single-digits, with strength in dairy and produce. Members responded positively to our new pack-size innovation in certain frozen food items. These items contain smaller bags within the main pack, increasing convenience for our members.","Grocery and beverage sales grew low single-digits, driven by growth in dry grocery, partially offset by declines in our beverage business, due to both weather and business member softness.","Sales of consumables posted a low single-digit comp. With the support of our strategic price investments, we delivered low to mid single-digit unit growth in areas like paper and tabletop. Our baby category continues to be a strong source of growth, with market share according to Nielsen growing by 20 basis points for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013.","Technology and entertainment posted a negative low single-digit comp. Pressures in office electronics and media were partially offset by compelling value in wireless, which posted double-digit comp and unit growth. According to The NPD Group, we gained market share in TVs for the 13-week period ending April 27, 2013.","Sales in apparel and home were down low single-digits. Home saw modest gains, driven by domestics and mattresses. Apparel was down due to seasonal merchandise, but our core basic apparel business posted mid single-digit comps, indicating strength in our underlying business. Jewelry, where we have strengthened our assortment and our price points, gained momentum throughout the quarter. Members responded very well to our improved selection of high quality diamonds.","Health and wellness, including pharmacy, experienced low single-digit comps. Over-the-counter merchandise continues to grow, especially diet products. We filled more prescriptions, but sales declined as the industry shifts more to generics. ","The majority of our prescription business remains maintenance related, generating regular traffic to our health and wellness area. We continue to increase awareness of the services available at Sam\u2019s Club, such as pharmacist-provided immunizations and health screening programs. During the quarter, we increased the number of health screenings by almost 30% over the same period last year.","Sales of ancillary categories negatively affected the quarter due to a decline in tobacco sales, driven by softness from our convenience store members as they see increased competition from dollar stores.","Moving to online, innovation and collaboration with our global ecommerce team resulted in double-digit sales growth for the quarter, driven by categories like portable electronics, baby, and mattresses. These categories were not only strong online, but also in our clubs, demonstrating that our members are finding great values no matter what channel they shop.","Gross profit rate remained relatively flat, as continued strategic price investments were offset by a more favorable mix, due to softer sales in lower margin categories like tobacco and beverages.","Strong membership growth is critical to remaining a healthy club business and we\u2019re focused on innovative ways to reach new prospects. We collaborated with Living Social from March 4 through the 6th to reach new Sam\u2019s Club members. The offer included a base membership, $20 gift card, and a merchandise package that included a variety of take-home meal solutions, all for $45, a total value of roughly $80. In just 48 hours, we had more than 157,000 people sign up for this offer, and we were pleased with the significant social media buzz and deal share volume generated.","Net membership income grew 2.4%, driven by Advantage member growth, offsetting slight declines from Business members. Membership and other income was up 6.5% versus last year, because of improved contract terms relating to our profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased by 12 basis points. A driver of this leverage was a decline in incentive expenses versus last year.  Looking at the bottom line, first quarter operating income was $519 million, a 6.6% increase over last year.","Inventory, including fuel, was up 6% year over year, as softer sales significantly affected our sell-through rate across several areas. Our management team is focused on actively slowing the rate of inventory growth to better align with the rate of sales.","We continue to focus on creating member value by executing our real estate strategy, enhancing the membership offering, improving item merchandising, and offering members access anytime, anywhere.","We are pleased with the performance of clubs opened within the last two to three years. During the quarter, we relocated one club in Texas City, which outperformed expectations. We plan to open 15 to 20 new and relocated clubs during the year, the majority of which we\u2019ve scheduled for the third and fourth quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to provide more details on our overall membership strategy. We applied key learnings from the last months of our membership pilot in Texas to enhance the value of a Sam\u2019s Club membership. The Texas pilot represents 12% of our total U.S. club base. ","As of yesterday, we increased our membership fee nationwide. The membership fee is now $45 for both Advantage and Business base memberships, reflecting a $5 and $10 increase, respectively. The fee for our Plus membership remains $100. ","This is our first increase since January 2006, and we do not expect a significant impact to renewal rates or new sign-ups. We will continue to offer additional value to our members while driving strong membership income in the coming years, as the full benefit of the fee increase will be recognized over the next 24 months.","Our first Instant Savings book, which is available to all members from May 15 through June 9, includes over $3,500 in savings on nearly 100 items, both in-club and through samsclub.com. Additionally, Plus members will continue to receive exclusive offers automatically loaded onto their membership card, which will now include fresh and private label items. ","With the exception of the cash rewards program for Plus members, these changes are consistent with our Texas pilot. Initial response to cash rewards has been positive. We will continue testing this benefit in Texas throughout the year to gain a better understanding of the longer-term financial impact.","You\u2019re also going to see a change in our merchandise strategy throughout the year. In the past, we\u2019ve had great success treating our clubs essentially the same, but we recognize our member base varies around the country. Moving forward, members will experience exciting merchandise, heightened by local brands, all displayed with a new level of visual excitement.","We\u2019re also adapting to serve our members who are shopping online and in our clubs. Members are using their mobile devices, before, during, and after their shopping experience.  The Sam\u2019s Club mobile app is giving our members personalized ecommerce and the ability to shop anywhere, anytime. ","Before visiting the clubs, members can build shopping lists and fill prescriptions. In the club, they can research merchandise information and compare costs. And alongside Walmart, we\u2019re piloting the Scan & Go app, which will be in 150 clubs by mid-June. Technology clearly enhances our members\u2019 shopping experience.","The combination of our strategies positions us well for the second quarter, and we have a number of events to drive sales. We were pleased with the first two weeks\u2019 start to the quarter. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from April 27 through July 26 to range between 1% and 3%. Last year, for the 13-week period, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 4.2%.","The core business at Sam\u2019s Club is solid. We\u2019re confident that the combination of new club growth, membership improvements, exciting and locally relevant merchandise, as well as e-commerce and digital opportunities, will drive momentum. We\u2019re proud of what we have accomplished in the past 30 years and are confident that we are well positioned going forward.","Now I\u2019ll turn the program over to Charles for our wrap up and guidance. Charles?","Charles Holley","Thanks, Roz. To wrap up, let me provide some perspective on the quarter. First, we feel good about many aspects of our company\u2019s performance.  We delivered 4.6% earnings per share growth in a tough sales environment.  Both Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club levered expenses and grew operating income faster than sales.  ","We generated solid cash flows from operations.  We grew our ecommerce sales more than 30% and grew market share in the U.K., Brazil, and China. We issued $5 billion of fixed income debt at record low rates on the strength of our balance sheet.  And, in February of this year, we announced an 18% increase in our dividend.","The first quarter also presented some challenges.  As a company, our leverage ratio was relatively flat, and although we grew consolidated operating income faster than sales, the growth did not meet our expectations. Looking ahead, our financial priorities remain growth, leverage, and returns, and we usually talk about them in this order. But today, I\u2019d like to start with a discussion on leverage.","The company\u2019s leverage in the first quarter was relatively flat, and the second quarter will be challenging as well. Our largest challenges are with International, as Doug spoke about, and our leverage services area, where we are investing in projects and programs that will save costs in the long run.","Operating expense leverage is a critical piece of our business model, and we remain focused on delivering the five-year 100 basis point goal through fiscal 2017. Though expense leverage is not expected to be achieved equally across the quarters every year, we are committed to leveraging operating expenses for this year.","Early investments to expand our leverage initiatives will initially have a short-term impact on expenses. However, these investments will benefit Walmart for the long term. Our leverage teams are focused on three key areas: best practice implementation, building greater sourcing capabilities, and back office efficiency.","Under the \u201cbest practice\u201d umbrella, for example, our global business process teams continue to work on self-checkout expansion, auto replenishment systems, and associate scheduling systems.  Our sourcing teams are working to increase direct import volumes to deliver greater savings on cost of goods and transportation. We also continue to make progress on goods not for resale, especially in the refrigeration and energy areas.","In our back office area, we completed the migration of work from four different finance offices in Central America to a regional center that is now serving most of our Latin American countries. Initiatives like this help us simplify, prioritize, and focus.","In addition, we continue to invest in our international markets through new store growth and our compliance organization. Jeff provided details earlier on the expenses related to the ongoing FCPA matters, as well as the processes we\u2019re putting in place to continue to strengthen our global compliance organization.","Now let\u2019s talk about growth. During the quarter, we added over 5 million square feet of retail space. Our total revenue growth was less than we expected, growing 1% versus last year. In addition, headwinds from currency impacted top line more than we anticipated. However, as you heard from Bill, Roz, and Doug, we feel confident about our growth in the second quarter and the balance of the year.","One final comment on sales, ecommerce will continue to grow in importance for our company. During the quarter, e-commerce sales increased by over 30%, and we continue to make strategic investments in the markets that offer us the greatest growth opportunity. We\u2019re focusing this investment in key areas, including our global technology platform and next-generation fulfillment networks, as well as scaling additional markets around the world.","We remain focused on four important markets in ecommerce. From a traffic perspective, we see over 45 million visitors each month in the U.S. on walmart.com, where growth and conversion are accelerating. In the U.K., we\u2019re the second largest online grocer, while in Brazil we were just named the number one trafficked ecommerce site. And, you\u2019ve heard us talk about our investment in Yihaodian, one of the fastest growing e-commerce businesses in China. We\u2019re excited about the potential for growth in this space, and Neil Ashe has assembled the talent necessary to achieve our growth plans.","Let me finish our discussion on our financial priorities today by talking about returns. We deployed cash to grow our business and return value to shareholders. During the quarter, $3.8 billion was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Walmart has a long history of delivering great returns for our shareholders, and we remain committed to continuing this trend.","Let\u2019s move on to guidance. As we think about earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, there are a couple of specific items that we have included. First, we told you during the fourth quarter last year that investments in Global ecommerce initiatives would have an incremental $0.09 impact for fiscal 2014. During the second quarter, we expect an impact of about $0.02 per share. This is in line with the $0.02 impact we had in the first quarter.  Additionally, we believe costs associated with FCPA matters will be between $65 and $70 million for the second quarter.","Taking these factors into consideration, along with current business and macroeconomic trends, including currency, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be between $1.22 and $1.27. Last year, Walmart delivered earnings per share of $1.18 in the second quarter.","Thank you for your support of our company. Have a great day!","Operator","The forward-looking statements in this call that are intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, generally were identified by the use of the words or phrases \u201care committed,\u201d \u201care piloting,\u201d \u201care planning,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cgoing to see,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201cis forecasted,\u201d \u201cmay fluctuate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cwill allow,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cwill benefit,\u201d \u201cwill be placed,\u201d \u201cwill be ready,\u201d \u201cwill communicate,\u201d \u201cwill conclude,\u201d \u201cwill continue,\u201d \u201cwill deliver,\u201d \u201cwill demonstrate,\u201d \u201cwill drive,\u201d \u201cwill expand,\u201d \u201cwill experience,\u201d \u201cwill\u2026have,\u201d \u201cwill improve,\u201d \u201cwill include,\u201d \u201cwill operate,\u201d \u201cwill put,\u201d \u201cwill start,\u201d \u201cwill strengthen\u201d or a variation of one of those words or phrases in those statements, or by the use of words and phrases of similar import.

Brett Biggs, Walmart's CFO, will show the overall financial results along with highlights for our three operating segments, Walmart U.S., international and Sam's Club. He will wrap up with guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2017.","Now I would like to turn it over to our CEO, Doug McMillon. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Pauline and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to hear more about our first quarter results and an update on our overall strategy. We're off to a good start to the fiscal year. For the first quarter, EPS was $0.98 which is above the top end of our guidance. Excluding a $3.5 billion currency impact, we delivered total revenue of $119.4 billion which is growth of $4.6 billion or 4% over last year. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. We exceeded both our EPS and Walmart U.S. comp sales guidance. As we described in October, we're improving our stores, adding critical capabilities and deepening relationships with customers.","We're encouraged by the Walmart U.S. comp and believe it is attributable to real improvement in our store experience. Our customers are giving us positive feedback and I'm seeing it myself on store visits and you can see it in the traffic numbers. We delivered comp sales of 1% in Walmart U.S. due to continuing traffic increases which improved 1.5% this quarter. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic. It is exciting to see the improvement in core retail fundamentals. For example, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making on inventory. That progress is important in its own right and for cash flow purposes but it can also help create a virtuous loop. When combined with our investments in training and associate education, wages and store structure, it is giving our associates more time on the sales floor to serve customers. Our customer satisfaction scores have continued to strengthen and our in stock has gotten better.","Our associates are responding and I'm proud of them, Greg Foran and the entire U.S. leadership team. In the quarter we did a better job of managing costs. SG&A discipline improved as our store teams did a good job of more closely aligning expenses with sales growth. Better expense management in the quarter gave us increased confidence to initiate our next phase of U.S. price investment earlier than planned. Over time we intend to lower prices further in a deliberate strategic way to drive our productivity loop. Doing this in a sustainable way takes time and we're seeing progress. Globally on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV grew 7% and 7.5% respectively, growth here is too slow.","The U.S. number is better than the global number but neither is as high as we would like. We can see progress against several of the necessary capabilities we need to win in e-commerce but we're still working on a few others. We need them all to come together to see stronger growth. For example, our marketplace is ramping up but it takes time to build the assortment to the point where customers realize the depth of assortment. We now offer more than 10 million SKUs on Walmart.com and we're growing that number through a combination of first-party and third-party items. It makes sense that perception will trail reality and we will work on both during the course of this year.","We will build on the successes we have seen around the world including in the U.S. and we will continue to work through the challenges we have experienced in key markets like Brazil, China and the UK where our e-commerce and mobile commerce sales are softer. We're pleased with our e-commerce operating system and happy to have our new e-commerce fulfillment centers operational. Those are necessary building blocks. I'm excited about the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationship with customers and help them save both money and time. Our Grocery Pickup service in the U.S. continues to receive high marks from customers and we're continuing to expand it.","I'm pleased to share we're announcing nine new markets today bringing our total number of markets to nearly 40 by the end of this month. In addition, in some markets, we will double the number of stores that offer the service locally in May. We expect to continue to quickly expand to new markets. The Walmart app is also allowing us to serve customers in convenient ways whether it is by finding an item in store, researching a product or refilling a prescription. Walmart Pay is enhancing our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience as customers quickly pay with their phone. A few weeks ago we began to expand this service nationwide and we're on schedule to complete the rollout by the end of June. Walmart International had a strong start to the year with 10 of our 11 markets posting positive comp sales and nine of those markets growing comp sales by more than 4% on a constant currency basis.","In particular, WalMex and Canada continue to perform well with strong sales, market share gains and solid profit performance. China remains a strategic market for our future and is now our fourth largest international market from a sales standpoint. We recently held a Board of Directors meeting in China and while visiting stores and e-commerce operations, I continue to be encouraged by the pace of operational improvements made by our team in China. A highly competitive environment and food deflation in the UK continued to challenge the market significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends in our business. We're focused on making strategic investments to improve our position in the market and invest in price while being diligent in managing our bottom-line and cash flow.","At Sam's Club, we're pleased with the growth in membership income. Plus member penetration is near an all-time high and we like the trend we're seeing. It is clear that members recognize the value that a plus membership brings. Comp sales for the period were in line with our guidance but we know we can deliver stronger results. Leading in digital is a focus area for Sam's and the team is doing a good job of delivering for members as we continue to see strong growth in Club Pickup.","Finally, we look forward to welcoming many of our shareholders, investors and associates to Northwest Arkansas in a few weeks for our annual meeting. This is one of my favorite weeks of the year as we get a chance to connect with you and share more of our thinking about the business. We also bring in associates from around the world. It is inspiring to see them and hear their stories. We hope you will join us for a great meeting. In summary, we're continuing to do what we said we would do on our strategic plan and we're getting traction as a result.","Now I will turn it over to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Thanks, Doug and good morning everyone. As Pauline mentioned, our earnings materials are a little different this quarter. Our intent is to continue to provide you with a high level of transparency and information but in a more efficient and concise manner. For example, we have added specific comments and highlights on the performance of each of our operating segments within the financial presentation instead of being spread out among several parts of a lengthy transcript. Therefore it is important that you review the financial presentation in conjunction with the comments from Doug and me. We hope you find this new format more efficient and we look forward to any feedback you may have. With that, let's turn our attention to the results for the quarter.","I would like to start by taking a minute to thank all of our associates around the world. Over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to visit with associates in our U.S. stores as well as in China, Japan and Brazil and I was encouraged by the level of dedication they continue to demonstrate. As a company, we're executing against our strategic priorities and not only delivering short to midterm improvements but positioning Walmart for long term success. We still have work to do, however, we're pleased that our first quarter results demonstrate continued progress. First quarter EPS of $0.98 was above our guidance range.","During the quarter, we saw a benefit from lower utility and maintenance expenses due to a milder winter in the U.S. and slightly lower costs from store closures announced last quarter. From a revenue standpoint excluding the $3.5 billion currency impact, total revenue increased $4.6 billion or 4% to $119.4 billion. On a reported basis, our total revenue increased 0.9% to $115.9 billion. Walmart U.S. delivered comp sales of 1% due to continuing solid traffic which increased 1.5%. This is our seventh straight quarter of positive comp sales and our sixth straight quarter of positive comp traffic. Globally, e-commerce sales increased 7% and GMV grew by 7.5% in the first quarter on a constant currency basis which is not as strong as we wanted. We're pleased with the ways we're using technology to deepen our relationships with customers and helping them save both money and time, for example our Grocery Pickup service in the U.S. will be in nearly 40 markets by the end of this month which is up from 22 when we started the year.","Advances we have made in fulfillment capabilities including our most recent center in Southern California, mean customers can get the items they want fast and at Walmart prices. Although we're making progress on several of our key priorities, we have more work to do particularly in some of our largest international markets. Gross profit increased 60 basis points during the quarter primarily driven by gross margin improvements in the U.S. which I will discuss in more detail shortly. During the quarter, we were more disciplined from an expense standpoint. However as anticipated, total SG&A increased compared to the first quarter of last year primarily as a result of our previously announced wage rate increase which took effect in February.","As you review our financial statement, you will notice a reduction in interest expense as well as an increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interest. As a reminder, the primary reason for the year-on-year variances is related to the sale-leaseback accounting correction we made in Canada during the first quarter of last year which impacted these line items and had a de minimis overall impact on operating income and EPS. Along with solid operating performance, disciplined working capital management allowed us to generate approximately $4 billion of free cash flow which compares to $2.2 billion generated in the first quarter of last year. We also returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. During the quarter, we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2.7 billion.","With that, let's now turn our attention to the results for each of the operating segments. Walmart U.S. had a good first quarter with comp sales ahead of guidance driven by solid traffic growth. We continued to steadily execute against the plan we laid out a year ago and we're seeing positive results from these efforts. Our customers continue to tell us they are happy with the changes we're making in our stores as evidenced by our customer experience scores which rose again this quarter versus last year. Comparable sales were up 1% in the first quarter despite continued impacts from deflation and food which we estimate impacted our total comp by approximately 60 basis points relative to last year's first quarter comp. Customer traffic increased 1.5%.","E-commerce contributed approximately 20 basis points to the overall comp. In addition, our Neighborhood Market format also delivered a comp sales increase of approximately 7%. We have good momentum in the business as on a two-year stack basis comp sales for Walmart U.S. were up 2.1%. We saw strength in general merchandise driven by solid sales growth in hardlines, home and seasonal and apparel. While entertainment continues to be a sales headwind, we did see some improving trends in electronics. Branded drug inflation and script growth drove pharmacy sales while better in-stock levels and a focus on the right assortment drove sales growth in both consumables and OTC. Gross margin improved 44 basis points in the quarter.","We delivered improved margin rates in food, consumables and health and wellness as our continued focus on reducing costs both in how we operate the business and in procuring merchandise provided benefits. In addition, transportation costs benefited from lower fuel prices, we had some improvements in shrink and we also lapped last year's incremental expenses related to the West Coast port congestion. Operating expenses increased 11.5% over last year primarily due to previously announced wage rate increases. However, our store teams were more efficient in managing expenses to more closely align with sales growth and a milder winter drove lower utility and maintenance expenses.","Overall the SG&A increase was partially offset by improved gross margins which resulted in an operating income decline of 8.8%. Inventory continues to be a key focus area for Walmart U.S. and we're pleased with the progress we're making toward our goal of stronger working capital management. Inventory declined 3.5% in the first quarter including a 5.7% decline in comp stores. The inventory discipline is driving benefits across the store such as improved in-stock levels and more efficient processes for our associates. Finally, as we communicated in October, price investment is always an important part of our growth plan. We began the initial phase of additional price investment late in the first quarter lowering prices on key items in select geographies.","As always we're committed to providing quality merchandise at a great value using data and analytics to better serve our customers. Heading into the second quarter, the execution of Walmart U.S.'s strategic plan remains on course. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%. As a reminder, the comp sales increase for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 was 1.5%. Now let's turn to Walmart International. Walmart International had a strong start to the year despite some continuing challenges in certain markets. As a reminder in all countries except Brazil and China, our financial results are inclusive of our e-commerce performance. Comp sales remain strong with all markets other than the UK posting positive comp sales. Also worth mentioning, nine of our markets grew comp sales by more than 4% on a constant currency basis. This year Easter benefited the first quarter some in International as the holiday last year fell within the second quarter given the one month reporting lag in all markets except Canada.","Overall, net sales grew 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Reported net sales declined 7.2% due to the $3.5 billion currency headwind although the impact was slightly less than anticipated. From an expense and cost of goods perspective, we're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our cost analytics program which includes fact-based negotiations and new merchant tools. We're now expanding the program beyond the UK and Canada to include Mexico in Q2 and other markets in Q3 and Q4. We're also focused on We Operate for Less initiatives across our markets and we're pleased that we leveraged expenses in the majority of our markets. From a profitability standpoint, operating income increased 22% on a constant currency basis and increased 8.8% on a reported basis driven by solid sales and broad gross profit rate improvement.","On a constant currency basis, inventory grew slower than net sales at 2.2% due to a focus on reducing unproductive and obsolete merchandise while on a reported basis inventory declined 6.9%. Within the accompanying financial presentation you will find detailed information for our five major markets. However, I will give some highlights on these markets starting with two which are performing exceptionally well. WalMex continues to lead the way delivering strong results. As a reminder, WalMex releases results under IFRS and the results discussed here are under U.S. GAAP, therefore some numbers may differ. Sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions and countries led by strong results in food and consumables.","Total sales and comp sales performance significantly outpaced the rest of the self-service market. Comp sales for WalMex increased 8.6% in the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, higher gross margins driven by strong inventory management reduced clearance and good expense management led to strong growth in operating income. In Canada, comp sales increased 6.7% driven by strong traffic growth of 4.6%. Comp sales have now been positive for eight consecutive quarters. The performance was driven by improvements in our merchandise assortment and price investment which led to strong customer traffic growth.","Our e-commerce business also continued to grow nicely with the expansion of online grocery in the greater Toronto area. Even as e-commerce investments continued, our ability to leverage expenses led to growth in operating income that outpaced sales growth. The UK continues to struggle, due primarily to fierce competition. Improvements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large-format stores.","However, project renewal remains a focus with the aim to simplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales. The cost analytics program which is part of Project Renewal made good progress and delivered savings we were able to invest back into the business. Our China business continues to grow and is now our fourth largest international market by revenue. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, strong performance during Chinese New Year, double-digit growth in gift card loading and continued strengthening of fresh categories led to good sales growth and positive comps. In Brazil, despite ongoing economic challenges, our team is making the right decisions to better position the business for both short- and long term success. We're pleased with the positive comp sales performance in the quarter.","Overall, our International strategy remains simple and focused and we continue to execute against our key priorities around the world. Now let's turn to Sam's Club. At Sam's Club, net sales without fuel grew by 2.9%. Membership income increased by nearly 4% as Plus member renewables grew by more than 30% and Plus penetration was there an all-time high. Comp sales excluding fuel increased 0.1% in the period as deflation especially in fresh meat and dairy continued to be a headwind and negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 50 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. E-commerce performed well and contributed 60 basis points to the comp including sales through Club Pickup which grew by more than 30%. In addition, our direct to home business experienced impressive growth. Gross profit rate increased 18 basis points even as we made investments in price and in the cash rewards program.","As planned, investments in people and technology led to growth in operating expenses that outpaced our sales growth. The team at Sam's is in the early stages of executing against the strategies as outlined at the end of last year. We know we have work to do and we're on the right path. For the 13-week period ending July 29, 2016, we expect comp sales to be slightly positive. So let's wrap things up. This is an exciting time for the company and our financial strength positions us to make the necessary investments in the business to drive sustainable long term results. We're proud of our overall results in the first quarter and there is momentum in many parts of the business. Based on our views of the global operating environment and assuming currency exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings per share to range between $0.95 and $1.08. We appreciate your interest in our company. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Shareholder's meeting in a couple of weeks.","Operator","This call included certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

This Carol Schumacher, Vice President of Investor Relations for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal 2013. All information for this quarter, including our unit counts, square footage and financial metrics, is available on our website, and that's walmartstores.com\/investors.","Please note that while we update unit counts on a monthly basis on our website, in the earnings discussion today, unit counts and square footage are referred to as of the quarter end. Our press release is available on the website, and a full transcript of this call has already been posted there.","Here's the agenda for today's call. Mike Duke, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will open the call with his thoughts about the quarter as well as highlights of our key results. Jeff Davis, SVP of Finance and Treasurer, will cover the consolidated financial details. Then we'll kick off the operations portion with Bill Simon, President and CEO of Walmart U.S. Next will be Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Walmart International. And Rosalind Brewer, President and CEO of Sam's Club, will round out that portion. Charles Holley, our CFO, will wrap up the call with an analysis of our financial priorities as well as EPS guidance for the third quarter and the full year.","A few reminders before we get into the details. Walmart's consolidated financial statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for both our U.S. and Canadian operations and December 31 for all other operations. We provide comparable sales guidance for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club on the 4-5-4 calendar each quarter for the upcoming quarter. We do not give any annual comp guidance for the U.S. operations.","We refer to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates throughout this call. As you know, for financial reporting purposes, each period, we convert the balance sheets and operating results from the local country currency to the U.S. dollar. The increase or decrease in the company's results as a result of changes in these currency exchange rates from one year to the next is what we refer to as the impact of currency exchange rates. We calculate the effect of such changes as the difference between current period activities translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and translated using the comparable prior year period's rates. We also exclude the impact of acquisitions until those acquisitions are included in both comparable periods. This methodology is what we use to calculate measures on a \"constant currency\" basis. There is additional disclosure in today's press release on the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations to our business.","When we use the term gross profit, we're referring to actual dollars. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit rate refers to the percentage obtained by dividing gross profit by sales dollars. All comparisons are calculated as the change between the current quarter and the prior year quarter unless stated otherwise.","Consistent with our forward-looking statement at the beginning of today's call, we discuss our existing Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation and related matters in the filed portion of our May 17, 2012, Form 8-K as well as in our Form 10-Q that was filed on June 1, 2012. Please refer to that disclosure on our website for information concerning these FCPA matters. The investigation remains ongoing, and it would be inappropriate to comment further on specific allegations and for us or others to come to specific conclusions until the investigation is finished.","As a reminder, our annual meeting for the investment community is Wednesday, October 10 in Bentonville, Arkansas. The meeting will begin early in the morning that day. And as always, we will video webcast the presentations, and they'll be archived on the Investor portion of our website.","During the past year, we've been working very hard to enhance our corporate website, and the new site will be live next week. You'll find the Investors tab at the new site located at www.corporate.walmart.com, and you'll be redirected if you go to our current website to the new location.","One last item. We launched the Walmart Investor Relations app in April, which has a great deal of information for our shareholders. The latest update of the app will be available the last week of August. You can download it really easily for both iOS and Android devices.","That's it for the announcements. So let's get started, Mike, with our results.","Michael Terry Duke","Thanks, Carol, and good morning, everyone. Walmart had a strong second quarter, and I'm pleased with the earnings and overall results our company delivered. Our more than 2 million associates around the world did a fantastic job of serving our customers, and they really appreciate that we help our customers save money so that they can live better.","Walmart reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.18 at the top of our guidance of $1.13 to $1.18. This represents an 8.3% increase from last year's second quarter EPS of $1.09.","Let's cover some of the highlights from the second quarter. Walmart U.S. continued its momentum this quarter with comp sales growth of 2.2%. Ticket and traffic were positive, and operating income grew faster than sales. Our Walmart U.S. business now has delivered positive comp sales for 4 consecutive quarters.","I'm really proud of International's underlying performance. All countries delivered positive comp sales for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales would have grown 7.2%, and operating income would have been up 11.9%.","Sam's Club continues to provide value to its members by delivering consistently strong results driven by positive traffic and ticket due to quality merchandise. Comp sales without fuel increased 4.2%, and operating income grew more than twice the rate of sales. We reported consolidated net sales of $113.5 billion, up 4.5%. Currency negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2.2 billion, and without that impact, net sales would have been $115.7 billion.","It should be no surprise to hear me say that our company leveraged operating expenses again this quarter. Our intense focus on delivering productivity and reducing cost allows us to invest in lower prices for our customers and to deliver strong profitability for our shareholders. Consolidated operating income was $6.7 billion this quarter, up 4.9% from last year. We achieved our goal of growing profits faster than sales.","I'm really pleased with the continued momentum we see in our Walmart U.S. stores, and this now marks 3 consecutive quarters of positive comp traffic and 4 quarters of positive comp sales. There's such a clear focus among the leadership team to drive the strategy of broad assortment and price leadership. We continue to win back customers and attract new ones. We will not let up on our passion to reduce operating expenses so that we can invest in lower prices. This is the promise our customers expect from Walmart and what drives greater loyalty.","We are also pleased with the sales and profitability for Walmart International. Our goal is to achieve profitability and returns that are more balanced, and to do that, we must improve operational and sales productivity in some of our emerging markets. EDLP drives customer loyalty and helps reduce cost. Our full transition to EDLP is underway, and this remains central to long-term growth for International.","We are moderating our strategic investment in new stores in 3 emerging markets as we focus our leadership teams on improving comp sales in existing stores. International remains our growth engine but at a slightly slower pace, and you will hear more from Doug on the details.","We are strengthening our capital efficiency model to improve site approval, design and the review process for new stores in all operating segments. We believe this will increase the success rate of our new stores and provide for stronger comp sales in the future. Across all operating segments, we also are reducing construction cost to deliver more productive stores.","Now I love visiting Sam's Club. The quality and innovation in merchandising and services are contributing to strong comp sales with increases in traffic and ticket. On a 2-year stacked basis, Sam's continues to drive fantastic comp sales while improving quality. The result of Sam's initiatives is greater value, which helps attract new members and strong renewals.","We've been focused on stepping up the intensity of our Global eCommerce opportunity. Recruiting talent is easier now that we're gaining more respect in Silicon Valley for the innovative work that we're doing. The technology community sees our potential for the next generation of eCommerce, and there is a great deal of excitement about working for Walmart. Our goal is to have a deeper relationship with our customers to drive greater loyalty, and eCommerce is key to that strategy. We're also constantly driving innovation. We're building a new global platform to take our assortment and services to every one of our markets simultaneously.","As you know, we previously took a minority position in Yihaodian, a fast-growing eCommerce business in China. We're pleased that this week, our potential increased investment in Yihaodian received conditional approval by the antitrust regulatory authority in China. We still have a few important steps before the agreement is completed, but we're encouraged by the progress and pleased with the response from the government.","On July 2, we marked the 50th anniversary of our company, and we're pleased that our mission to save people money so that they can live better continues to drive us. The Walmart Every Day Low Price model is as relevant today as it was in 1962. For today's customers, the paycheck cycle remains pronounced in the United States and in our international markets. Given the continuing economic pressures, we believe that our price leadership and value are growing in importance to customers across income levels.","Before I close, I'm going to share some comments about our associates and the strength of the morale around the Walmart world. During the second quarter, I visited stores in Chicago, Texas, the Pacific Northwest, also the U.K. I am inspired by our associates and the conditions of our stores. They are happy to work for Walmart and to serve our customers.","As we continue to deliver greater results, we appreciate that Walmart customers and shareholders recognize the consistency of our results, the strategic steps we're taking to improve our business and the value of the investments we're making for the future. I believe that Walmart remains the healthiest and the best-positioned retailer for delivering growth, leverage and returns.","Now I'll turn it over to Jeff for the financial details. Jeff?","Jeffery Davis","Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.18, which compares to $1.09 last year. Recall last year, we had $115 million of pretax items that increased operating expenses and $17 million of pretax items that reduced gross profit. The sum of these pretax items negatively impacted EPS from continuing operations by approximately $0.03.","Now let's get to our results for the second quarter. Net sales increased 4.5% or $4.9 billion to $113.5 billion for the quarter. The increase included $1.9 billion of net sales from acquisitions, offset by a negative impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $2.2 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 4.7% to $113.8 billion.","As you can see, our company is not unlike many other global companies that were impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other foreign currencies. The U.S. dollar strengthened approximately 6% against our non-U.S. market currencies, with the greatest impact coming from Mexico and Brazil. As a result, net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $3 billion year-to-date.","Moving to our comp sales. Total U.S. comps without fuel increased 2.5% for the 13-week period ended July 27. Bill and Roz will provide more details on the strength of our comp sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club.","Membership and other income grew 4.7% compared to the second quarter of last year. Therefore, we closed the quarter with total revenue of $114.3 billion, up 4.5% from $109.4 billion last year.","Gross profit increased 3.8%, which corresponds to an 18-basis-point reduction in gross margin compared to last year. This is primarily due to price investments in Walmart U.S. and key international markets.","Our company continues to drive operating expense leverage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 20 basis points to 19.3% from 19.5% last year. Not only did the company leverage on a reported basis, we also leveraged expenses without the $115 million of pretax expenses realized last year.","Other unallocated expenses grew 14.4%. As a reminder, the components of other unallocated includes 3 areas: core corporate, Global eCommerce and global leverage services. Recall for comparability, last year in the second quarter, we had a $49 million loss on mark-to-market foreign currency derivative positions. Without this item, other unallocated increased 26.7%.","So let me provide additional detail on this increase. Within core corporate, we incurred approximately $34 million in expenses related to third-party advisors reviewing matters involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we expect these expenses to continue through the rest of the year. Excluding the expenses related to the FCPA, core corporate rose 13.2%, primarily due to higher incentive accruals resulting from better operating performance. You heard an update from Mike earlier on Global eCommerce activities, and we will continue to make ongoing investments in this important growth area moving forward.","As you know, one of our key financial metrics is to grow operating income faster than sales growth. Second quarter consolidated operating income grew 4.9% to $6.7 billion, which was faster than the rate of growth for sales. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 6.4% compared to 4.7% for net sales. However, on a constant currency basis and giving effect to the $132 million prior year pretax items, consolidated operating income increased modestly, slower than sales at 4.3%. Net interest expense was $505 million, which was 12.6% lower than last year, primarily due to lower interest accruals on tax-related matters and reduced debt levels.","Debt to total capitalization declined to 43.7% at the end of the quarter compared to 45.7% last year. Our improvement was driven by strong earnings performance, which also allowed us to reduce our outstanding debt balance.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 was 32.8%, and we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to be at the lower end of the previous guidance of 32.5% to 33.5%. You may see quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate that may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, tax law changes, audit results, discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and International operations. This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $4 billion, an increase of 5.7% from last year's second quarter of $3.8 billion.","During the quarter, we paid out $1.3 billion in dividends and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. Since our Board of Directors approved the $15 billion share repurchase authorization in June 2011, the company retired $7.1 billion, leaving $7.9 billion for additional share repurchase.","Free cash flow was $6.1 billion for the 6 months ended July 31, 2012, a 50% increase compared to $4 billion last year. The change was driven by the improvement in net inventory investment, changes in our 401(k) plan which affected the timing of accrued liabilities and improved operating results.","Consolidated inventory grew 4.4% compared to last year, in line with our net sales increase of 4.5%. Recall that our corporate goal is to grow inventory at or less than the rate of sales. We are proud that we are making progress on this important goal, and this is an improvement in our previous trends. Payables as a percentage of inventory were 89%, which is in line with the 90% we reported this time last year.","Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2012, was 18.1% compared to 18.4% for the previous year. Increased levels of average working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions affected ROI.","Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the second quarter. During the quarter, we added a total of 6 million square feet through 120 net new expanded and relocated units.","You will hear more from Doug on the changes in our capital plans for International, and Charles will update the total company forecast. Now let's turn it over to our operating segments. We'll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?","William S. Simon","Thank you, Jeff. I'm very pleased to report today that Walmart U.S. had another strong quarter. We delivered positive comps and continued to grow sales. We leveraged expenses and contributed very strong profits to the company by growing operating income faster than sales.","Now let's get into the specifics. Walmart U.S. generated a 2.2% sales comp, above the midpoint of our guidance of 1% to 3%. The momentum was continued throughout the quarter. In fact, July was one of our strongest months this year, delivering positive comps on top of positive comps last year.","I'm particularly energized by these results and proud of this performance. It highlights the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables us to consistently deliver results for our customers and for our shareholders. We're focused and aligned, driving the productivity loop throughout our business. In the second quarter, we again leveraged expenses across our operation, invested in price and helped our customers save.","Customers are responding to our continued focus on providing the right assortment at Every Day Low Prices. During the quarter, our average comp traffic increase was equal to serving, on average, 80,000 additional customers every day of the 13-week period. These visits represented a 0.4% increase in comp traffic in addition to a 1.8% increase in ticket for the quarter. When I think about our comp in terms of pure customer numbers, it's pretty amazing. Sales growth in the quarter was well balanced, with positive comps across all 3 geographic business units and in all of our store formats.","Our 1.4 million associates did an outstanding job serving our customers, and I'm particularly pleased with the results we achieved during the key holiday events of Mother's Day, Father's Day and the Fourth of July. Despite a midweek holiday, July 4 sales, especially in key categories like food, significantly exceeded our expectations.","As you know, price leadership is at the center of our strategy. Our marketing team is focused on ensuring the price message resonates with our customers and sets us apart from the competition. You've likely seen a few of our market basket challenge commercials. These ads are tailored for individual markets, but the message is always the same: Walmart wins on the overall basket of items.","The TV spots are currently running in key markets and clearly show the price separation Walmart offers with competitors in grocery and drug. For those of you who haven't seen one of our commercials, I encourage you to visit the Investor portion of our company's website to see one.","Customers are responding favorably to the message, which is running in 25 metro markets. We're proud that we do so well competitively on the basket challenges. Keep in mind, these are actual baskets the customer has purchased, not just a key item comparison. We're also pleased with the sales and traffic results versus the control markets. Our customers appreciate value, especially in uncertain economic times. We'll continue to lead on price through the back-to-school season and into the second half of the year.","Now I'd like to discuss the details of our second quarter performance. Net sales were $67.4 billion, an increase of 3.8% over last year. Adding an additional $2.5 billion in sales on top of a nearly $65 billion base is no small feat, yet our teams continue to do it quarter after quarter by simply focusing on serving our customers.","Gross profit dollars were up 3% year-over-year to $18.6 billion. Similar to last quarter, the gross profit rate was down 20 basis points from last year. As we noted last quarter, you'll continue to see a decrease in our gross margin rate versus last year as we execute our strategic price investment.","As you may know, in addition to their regular pay, we offer hourly associates a quarterly bonus. Our operating performance continues to result in historically high field incentives. For the second consecutive quarter, more than 80% of our eligible hourly associates will benefit from that near-record incentive payout. We're pleased to share this success with our associates and know they appreciate the immediacy of the payout.","Overall operating expenses were up 2.5% in the second quarter to $13.6 billion, well below our sales growth. Even with the impact of these higher field incentive payouts, we leveraged operating expenses by 27 basis points this quarter.","Operating income grew faster than sales, rising 5.3% over last year to almost $5.3 billion. We continue to increase efficiency throughout the business and drive additional dollars to the bottom line.","Our inventory was up 3.6% versus last year, which was slightly below the rate of sales growth for the second quarter. We're refining our local assortment while focusing on back-to-school and the holiday season. We're excited about our plans, and we feel our inventory position will help us drive sales in the back half of the year.","Most of our merchandising areas again delivered solid performance, though industry trends in electronics continue to impact the broader entertainment category. We're seeing market share growth across grocery and health and wellness. You can expect to hear more about market share and how we're using Nielsen data during our annual analyst meeting in October.","Grocery, which includes food and consumables, delivered a low single-digit positive comp for the quarter. Our focus on winning key seasonal events paid off as we saw very strong food sales around Fourth of July holiday.","Another big success this quarter has been our USDA Choice steak program. The program has helped drive sales to the entire meat department, which outperformed the overall food business by approximately 300 basis points in the second quarter. The unmatched combination of quality and value has resonated with a large number of our customers, including many who had not previously shopped our meat department.","In consumables, sales remain strong as our continued focus on price and assortment drove positive traffic. For the third consecutive quarter, all departments reported positive comps as customers responded favorably to product innovation and value-driven pricing. Our health and wellness business also performed well, delivering a low single-digit positive comp.","In OTC, our broadened assortment, particularly our focus on opening price point, resonated well with customers and drove growth through the quarter. As expected, our prescription business experienced an increase in brand-to-generic conversion as drugs such as Plavix and Lipitor were affected by new generic offerings. While this has had an impact on top line sales, we benefited in profitability. More importantly, these generic drugs provide an opportunity to help our customers live better by lowering the cost of their prescriptions. As generic conversions accelerate in the third and fourth quarters, we'll continue to actively manage through the transitions and deliver additional value for our customers.","At walmart.com, our team is committed to making it easier for our pharmacy customers to shop. In conjunction with @WalmartLabs, we redesigned our pharmacy website and simplified the process of ordering prescriptions online. Since the relaunch in May, script comps have increased every month.","Hardlines continued its positive trend with a low single-digit positive comp. A stronger and broader assortment is driving sales across all categories, and we feel good about the balanced growth of this business. Stationery and crafts improved significantly this quarter, while sporting goods, automotive and hardware also performed well.","Within crafts, our reintroduction of fabrics resonated very well with our customers. We increased the assortment, doubled the footage of kids' crafts and added complementary merchandise. Our customers clearly noticed, and we achieved a double-digit comp in this area.","Our entertainment business had a low single-digit negative comp. While industry dynamics continue to pressure media and gaming, demand for tablets and tablet accessories remains strong. Customers continue to seek out the exclusive Walmart Straight Talk offering and our expanded assortment of smartphones. Straight Talk prepaid phones posted strong double-digit comp growth in the second quarter. We also introduced a solutions-focused merchandising approach that drove stronger printer and ink sales.","Home, including seasonal categories, had a low single-digit positive comp. Our continued focus on basics supported by strong item merchandising and a refined assortment drove strong performance in the quarter. Indoor living, led by cooking and dining, again performed well as most departments posted an increased comp versus the first quarter.","Back-to-school and back-to-college shopping is well underway. Our stores were ready to serve shoppers early in the season, and we're pleased with the results. Season-to-date, key back-to-school apparel categories are up 7%. Within home, we're seeing strong performance in college essentials, like bedding and bath.","We've stepped up our ability to serve students and teachers by integrating our stores with eCommerce. Classrooms by Walmart is a new online tool which digitized almost 55,000 school supply lists across the country. Walmart's the first major retailer to offer this feature, and it includes schools in all 50 states.","We're using other online tools to drive sales through walmart.com and in our nearly 4,000 stores. Our online integration offers fun and affordable options for college living by inspiring customers to build their own rooms. It's driving sales in furniture, storage and home, and is getting strong attention through Pinterest. Our closets for less tool helps families mix and match basic outfits and has driven increased interest in our apparel departments.","Speaking of apparel, our momentum continued in the second quarter. I'm proud of the work that the team has done, and I'm very happy to say that our focus on basics is working. For the quarter, we delivered low single-digit positive comp, our second consecutive quarter of positive comps. Our customers continue to turn to Walmart for their basics, a key element of our apparel strategy that is built around jeans, underwear, socks and tees. You see this executed in every store. In the second quarter, we had solid results in ladies' and men's department as well as positive comps in shoes, which benefited from the addition of new brands.","We're pleased with the balanced growth we're seeing across the box. Our focus on assortment and pricing is resonating well, and customers are shopping the entire store. Overall, both the grocery and general merchandise business performed well and had positive comps.","In the second quarter, we continue to see varying inflationary trends across the box. Within entertainment, deflation continues to impact sales growth in electronics. Total grocery inflation moderated slightly from what we reported in the first quarter. In categories with higher inflation, customers continue to trade down.","We are also monitoring key commodities in the severe drought across parts of the country to gauge potential impact on food prices throughout the remainder of the year. Walmart is well positioned to serve our customers in this challenging market environment.","We're gearing up for the second half of the year both online and in our stores. We also continue to grow through new stores. In the second quarter, we added 27 Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. As we continue to accelerate our small format program, we opened 17 new Neighborhood Markets this quarter, the most small format growth we had in a single quarter. So far this year, we've opened 24 of our projected 80 to 100 small formats this fiscal year.","Small formats continue to play a bigger part of our real estate strategy. Our Neighborhood Markets continue to provide strong performance with positive sales and traffic comps. We're excited about the strategic investments we're making in this format. Our first 2 California Neighborhood Markets opened this quarter and are exceeding expectations.","Our first Express stores have now been open for a year and are generating positive comp sales. We will continue to monitor and expand this test format. In the coming quarters, we're going to begin refining our distribution and operations strategy with the opening of multiple Express stores in a single markets.","During the third quarter, we expect to open between 95 and 100 total new units, which include both small formats and Supercenters, including new stores, expansions, relocations and conversions. You'll hear more about our future capital plans in October during our annual meeting for the investment community.","Within our distribution network, our logistics team again reduced cost per case shipped by 5.4% this quarter versus last year's second quarter, excluding the impact of fuel cost. We transported 65 million more cases and drove 5 million fewer miles, which lowered expenses and supported our sustainability initiatives. The logistics organization continues to be a key leverage driver for our business. Productivity improvements in this area of the business benefit both our gross profit rate and our expense leverage.","Our store operations team has implemented a number of changes to drive productivity and enhance our customers' experience. We're further leveraging automation, like our My Guide tool, which helps managers with everything from resource planning to on-shelf availability. These types of investments that scale over our nearly 4,000 stores improve our efficiency.","We're also excited about the return of our holiday layaway program, which will begin in the third quarter. Quite simply, this serves a key need for our customers, and we're happy to make it available again. We've put in a lot of hard work and are well prepared for the back half of the year.","From a comp perspective, let me remind you that last year's third quarter comp was positive 1.3%. We're forecasting comp sales for the 13-week period from July 28 through October 26, 2012, to increase between 1% and 3%.","I'm very pleased with our performance as we delivered strong, consistent results by executing our strategy. In the third quarter, we'll continue to leverage expenses and invest the savings in price to fuel the productivity loop. We'll continue to support our pricing message on TV and with other media. We have a powerful strategy, and our Walmart associates know how to drive results. I'm confident in our ability to deliver sustained strong financial performance.","Now I'll turn it over to Doug for the International update. Doug?","C. Douglas McMillon","Thank you, Bill. Walmart International continues to drive sales growth and profitability. Net sales for the second quarter grew 6.4%, and operating income grew a little slower on a reported basis at 5.4%. On a constant currency basis, sales would have grown 7.2%, and operating income would have been up 11.9%. Every market delivered positive comps, and I'm pleased that our largest markets, the U.K., Mexico and Canada, collectively delivered stable growth, solid margins and expense leverage despite challenging environments.","Let me take a moment to describe how we're driving growth in returns from the Walmart International perspective. As you know, we have a consistent purpose everywhere we operate: to save people money so they can live better. In addition to our purpose, our organizational culture is driving consistency. Our Walmart culture supports our expectations of the ways associates should behave in order to drive results.","More recently, we've worked to strengthen the consistency of our operating principles. These principles include executing EDLP and EDLC, being merchandise driven, uncovering even greater opportunities for leverage across our markets and leading on social and environmental issues. And it's no surprise that when we implement these principles consistently, we get results.","Driving our EDLP-EDLC business philosophy into our markets remained a key priority. Where we're doing it well, we're winning. For example, EDLP has progressed well in Brazil. And from a trend perspective, comp sales are better, and we leveraged operating expenses this quarter.","Regardless of the market, customers want great merchandise at great prices. When we deliver that combination, we increase sales. In our Builders Warehouse format in South Africa, we recently launched a Great Value battery. As you know, Great Value is an important Walmart brand, and this battery retails for 35% less than the average national brand, and sales are going well. When we do this item by item, category by category, we can consistently grow comp sales and fulfill our purpose.","In a business with the reach of Walmart, we can certainly leverage ideas and processes. We have teams with particular expertise on topics from managing inventory as it flows through a store to format development and from systems to training that can be perfected and exported to others. For example, the associate scheduling process refined in the U.S. is being implemented in some formats in Mexico, and this is expected to improve service and productivity in the future.","Leading on social and environmental issues is consistent with our purpose and a key operating principle. And when we can meet sustainability goals and save money, it's a winning combination. One of our largest operating costs is for energy. In markets like Mexico and Japan, energy costs continue to rise. Now in Mexico, one wind farm is supplying almost 60% of the energy needs of the 348 stores. Our annual energy costs are now $3 million less than last year. By buying power at a set rate, we lower energy costs and mitigate cost fluctuations. Our goals are simple: drive growth and improve returns. We're creative in our execution but completely focused on ensuring that our foundation to achieve these goals becomes even stronger.","Now let's get into more of the financial results. Please remember that in the following discussion, we use the term constant currency, as Carol specified earlier.","On a reported basis, International net sales were $32 billion, up 6.4%. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased sales by approximately $2.2 billion. Operating expenses were up 4.1%, and the segment leveraged operating expenses. Operating income was $1.5 billion, up 5.4%. Currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased operating income by $110 million.","On a constant currency basis, International's second quarter net sales would have been $32.3 billion, up 7.2%. Acquisitions generated $1.9 billion in sales. Our gross profit rate was flat with last year, and operating expenses grew slower than sales as the majority of our markets leveraged operating expenses for the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $1.6 billion, up 11.9% and growing faster than sales.","On a reported basis, inventory was up 4.6% against our sales growth of 6.4%, but we always take a closer look at inventory on a constant currency basis. We haven't let up on our goal to improve inventory management, and there remains room for further improvement. But I'm pleased to report progress. Constant currency inventory would have grown 12% over last year, an improvement since the fourth quarter of last year. I'm very pleased that inventory days on hand were well managed in the U.K., Canada and the Asia markets. In our Latin America markets, inventory days on hand are higher than we would like, but I'm pleased to see improving trends since the challenges we had coming out of the fourth quarter.","Now let's get into the results for several of our larger markets. The following discussion is on a constant currency basis. And unless otherwise stated, sales and comp sales are presented on an unadjusted nominal calendar basis.","Let's begin with EMEA, which stands for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and which also includes Canada. The U.K. had a strong second quarter, growing sales and growing operating income faster than sales, excluding fuel. Despite a difficult consumer environment and the wettest weather on record, ASDA gained market share in the second quarter according to the Kantar Worldwide Panel Total Till Roll for the 12 weeks ending July 8. Excluding fuel, net sales grew 3.2%. Comparable sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.7%, with ticket up 2.6%, and traffic decreasing 1.9%. The strongest performances were in grocery, apparel and electronics. In addition, our online business in U.K. improved its already strong performance with sales growth of 22.1% in the quarter.","ASDA's continued commitment to EDLP was recognized by The Grocer magazine in June. ASDA's been named Britain's lowest-priced supermarket for the 15th year running and Britain's favorite supermarket for the second year in a row. In addition, the ASDA Price Guarantee continues to build a loyal following. In Q2, it attracted an average of over 600,000 checks per week.","The U.K.'s gross profit rate has increased slightly from last year due to strong inventory control in nonfood merchandise. Second quarter expenses grew slower than sales as ASDA continues to develop sustainable efficiency savings through process improvements.","Moving to Canada. Walmart Canada had good sales growth, and operating income increased compared to last year's results. Net sales grew 3.8% in the second quarter compared to last year, and comparable sales in the second quarter increased 0.5%. Walmart Canada's average ticket increased 0.9%, with traffic declining 0.4%.","Walmart Canada had strong comp sales in food and consumables, health and wellness and home lines. Some of the seasonal business was pulled forward into the first quarter due to good weather, so apparel and home lines were below expectations in the second quarter. Gross profit rate increased slightly due to greater sales penetration in private label. Expenses grew faster than sales primarily due to investments in our more aggressive new store growth.","As we have announced, this year marks the largest expansion program in Walmart Canada's 18-year history, with 73 projects scheduled. We will open the first of our Zellers to Walmart conversions this month. This first converted store, located in Ontario, will be almost 70,000 square feet and will include dry grocery merchandise.","Turning to Africa. Massmart continues to deliver strong performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. As you know, Massmart is a publicly held company in South Africa with a June year end and announces results every 6 months. Massmart's next earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, August 22. We reached the anniversary of our acquisition of Massmart, and in future quarters, we'll report comparable results of our performance in Sub-Saharan Africa as defined by Massmart's reporting schedule.","For the 12 months ended June 24, 2012, Massmart's total sales grew 15.5%, and comparable sales grew 9.6% versus the same period in 2011. Inflation was estimated at 1.8%. Massmart provided a pre-earnings release on August 7 and expects to grow net earnings by 36% to 44% for the 12 months ending June 2012.","We continue to be excited about the opportunities to share best practices and expertise with Massmart. We've worked with Massmart to implement unique Walmart-branded extended price cut promotions, which delivered significant savings to South African consumers. As part of these promotions, we partner with suppliers to improve lead times and forecasting, which is a driving factor behind our ability to provide lower prices.","Moving on to Latin America. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reports its earnings under IFRS, so some numbers are different from Walmex reported numbers.","Walmex had solid consolidated sales growth, and operating income increased from last year. Walmex's consolidated net sales for the second quarter were up 10%. Mexico's net sales were up 10.5%, and comparable sales were up 3%. Average ticket in Mexico increased 4.1%, and customer traffic decreased 1.1% over last year.","Mexico's second quarter comp store sales for the self-service formats grew 2.7%, while ANTAD's comp store sales report for the rest of the industry, excluding Walmex, grew faster at 4.5%. As a reminder, ANTAD is the National Association of Supermarkets and Department Stores and provides industry data and market share analysis.","In Central America, overall sales increased 6.5%, and comp sales were up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Second quarter consolidated gross profit rate for Walmex increased slightly from last year. Walmex leveraged consolidated operating expenses on store productivity initiatives, and operating income grew faster than sales.","Now let me cover our store growth plans in Mexico and Central America. In late June, Walmex announced a number of changes to its expansion program that will result in a delay of some stores by as much as 90 days. The revisions to the expansion program are partially due to additional steps Walmex is adding to its real estate process that extend the average time required to open a store. These steps include reinforcing documentation that supports real estate projects and enhancing processes with our business partners.","In addition, some stores that are scheduled to open in the latter half of December have been moved into January 2013 to allow our operations team to focus on the Christmas season. As a result of these changes, Walmex will add 5 million square feet and spend $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal 2013. By delaying our Walmex store openings, we have a decrease in our annual international square footage growth but will still spend the dollars in this year, ahead of the openings.","Moving on to Brazil. Brazil grew sales in the second quarter but had a slight operating loss for the quarter. As you know, Brazil began the EDLP journey last year, and we believe we're on our way to setting a stronger foundation and operating model in this important market.","Second quarter sales in Brazil grew 10.2% from last year, with comparable sales growing 5%. Average ticket grew 6.5%, and traffic declined 1.5% when compared to last year. The average ticket increase continues to be an encouraging sign that our customers see the value, and we will continue to demonstrate price leadership on a broad basket of goods.","Our suppliers and customers are benefiting from the simplification and efficiencies that EDLP brings to our retail business. We have not implemented EDLP in our wholesale formats yet, but that work is underway. Food and consumables in our retail formats were the first categories to have EDLP, because they drive customer loyalty.","Brazil leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter, growing them slower than sales. There's an ongoing focus on improving Brazil's operating income through expense management. Our in-country leadership continues to drive the productivity loop and invests the savings back into price to further drive sales growth. The sales growth and stability that they have already achieved from the adoption of EDLP have allowed them to focus on reducing operating costs. Brazil achieved cost reductions in areas including advertising, workforce management and freight optimization. And I'm pleased to tell you, Walmart Brazil ranked among the top 25 customer service excellence awards, a recognition given every year by Revista Exame, the most important business magazine in the country.","As we mentioned last quarter, we decided to slow down our new store growth in Brazil to ensure we are building a solid foundation to grow comp sales and to have EDLP in place. We made this decision last year, and so this year's growth has been slower than it would have been otherwise. Accordingly, we expect to decrease our square footage growth from our original plan.","Like Walmex and Massmart, Walmart Chile is also a publicly held company and will release second quarter earnings on August 30. For their previously announced first quarter results ending March 31, 2012, Chile grew first quarter 2012 sales 13.9%. First quarter operating income was lower than the prior year as prior year results were distinctively impacted by the gain on the sale of an investment.","Moving to Asia. Walmart China grew sales during the second quarter and slightly grew operating income versus a prior year loss. Net sales for the second quarter grew 10.9% over the last year, and the comparable store sales growth was 5%. Average ticket grew 10% in China, but traffic declined 5%. Second quarter gross profit rate was flat to last year. Operating expenses grew slower than sales.","Normally, at this time, I'd remind you that we're still working on closing the Trust-Mart acquisition. I'm pleased to say that during the second quarter, we completed the purchase of the remaining ownership in Trust-Mart and can now completely focus on running great stores in these locations.","In China, as with the rest of our markets, our customers want stores that are easy to shop, easy to get into and out of and are convenient for their lives. To improve our site selection and store design, we made a decision earlier this year to moderate our growth. In the past, we may have been too flexible and accepted stores that were located on too many levels or had difficult configurations. We now will open fewer stores this year than our original plan with only about half the new store square footage than we had forecast. We want all of our new stores in China to exceed customer expectations. Our locations in China are leased, so there is no significant change in capital dollars, only in square footage.","Turning to Japan. Japan's net sales, comparable sales and average ticket all grew in the second quarter in nominal terms, and Walmart Japan continues its market outperformance. Net sales grew 2%, with comp sales up 1.6%. Second quarter ticket grew 2%, and traffic was down 0.4%. According to statistics released by the Japanese Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry or METI, overall supermarket comparable sales for the second quarter declined by 1.9% from last year, indicating that Walmart Japan continues to outperform the market. Operating income increased from last year. Gross profit rate increased slightly, and Walmart Japan leveraged operating expenses from last year.","Across all markets, we continue to expand our store base to serve more customers, and it's important to do so in a disciplined and targeted way. As I mentioned, in certain markets, we're making separate and distinct actions to adjust our store growth in those markets.","Therefore, as a total division, we anticipate that the International square footage growth for FY '13 will be approximately 21 million to 23 million square feet and our CapEx dollars to be approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion. Our previous forecast was 30 million to 33 million square feet and $5 billion to $5.5 billion. This forecast does not include future acquisitions, should we make any, but does include capital for Massmart growth. Let me remind you that our CapEx dollars do not decrease in direct correlation with the square footage due to the effect of leasing in China and the timing of construction costs incurred in Mexico.","Let me summarize the key takeaways for International. We have momentum in our business and are prioritizing improvement in Brazil and China to position them for success for many years to come. We're progressing on further implementation of EDLP and EDLC in several markets. We're investing in our infrastructure and driving stronger foundations to ensure we are best positioned for the future. And we're integrating sustainability and social programs to help our communities and benefit our business. As always, we remain focused on helping our customers save money so they can live better. We serve our customers with passion and with purpose, and we'll continue to do our very best to serve them well every day.","Now I'll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam's. Roz?","Rosalind Gates Brewer","Thanks, Doug. Sam's Club had another very impressive quarter. We grew the top line, delivered positive comps and most important, grew operating income faster than sales. We continue to deliver steady traffic to the clubs. We believe that the improvements in our quality and overall merchandise offerings are key to driving these results. In fact, member engagement scores continue to achieve record levels. We're also investing in price to deliver greater value on top of these quality improvements.","Comp sales, without fuel, were up 4.2% for the 13-week period. Comp traffic and ticket for the 13-week period were up by 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively. This is on top of a 5% increase in the comparable period last year, indicating very strong member response to our business. Both Business and Advantage members helped drive increases in traffic and ticket.","Net sales, including fuel, were $14.2 billion, a 3.8% increase over last year's second quarter. Fuel prices in the second quarter were down 5.6% compared to last year, and gallons sold were up 3.9%, thus creating a drag on overall comp sales of 0.8%. Gross profit rate was up 23 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased only 2 basis points, and operating income increased 10.1% to $535.8 million.","Although fuel is an important traffic driver for the clubs, volatility in fuel prices can have a notable impact on our financial results. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion today is focused on our core business and excludes fuel for comparative purposes, unless otherwise noted.","Net sales were $12.5 billion, up 4.6% from last year. All geographic regions posted good comp performance, but the north division led sales performance for the quarter. This is the result of an intense focus by our operations team on improving the member shopping experience in our clubs. Gross profit rate increased by 17 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, driven by changes in merchandising mix, while gross profit increased 5.9%.","Strategic initiatives to deliver greater value, as I mentioned earlier, led to consistent strong comp performance across the merchandise portfolio. We ran an extended eValues Savings Celebration this quarter in anticipation of the midweek July 4 celebration, which drove traffic into the clubs for the week.","As multiple retailers across various retail segments, including the club channel, invest in price, there has been greater pricing pressure in the marketplace. While this is good for members and customers, it does pressure margin. However, as members have noticed exciting merchandise offerings in higher margin categories, mix has favorably impacted our margin rate.","We have worked hard to balance our price investment with the impact of inflation. For the second quarter, Sam's retail inflation was between 175 and 225 basis points, primarily in food, versus 200 and 250 basis points in last year's second quarter. Cost inflation was slightly higher than retail inflation, putting pressure on margin. At the same time, deflation continued in certain categories, like dairy and electronics.","Like Bill, we're monitoring the potential impact of the drought in the Midwest and the pressure it is expected to have on both corn and soybeans. We will continue to evaluate how this will affect food prices as we go through the year.","Grocery, including fresh and consumables, remains key to driving traffic and attracting new members. It is a key differentiator for us in the marketplace, and as we continue to invest in price, it will remain so. We delivered high single-digit comps in grocery and mid-single-digit comps in both beverages and fresh freezer cooler despite deflation in dairy. Members continue to enjoy new products, including hybrids like pluots, a plum-apricot mix and new wine labels.","In our consumables business, where we continue to focus on price, we had solid increases in unit sales. Tabletop and personal paper categories had mid-single-digit increases. Our recent launch of the new Member's Mark paper plate is outselling comparable branded items and is creating additional margin that allows us to price more aggressively.","Tobacco sales, which remain important for our convenience store owners, were a drag on overall comp sales for the quarter, but that reduction helped drive a merchandising mix that was a positive to profit. Technology, entertainment and office achieved low single-digit comps. Performance was strong in portable electronics, including tablets but challenged by continued softness in video games, movies and books.","Focus on product quality and ensuring that we have the right brands at a great value have driven results in discretionary categories. We achieved high single-digit comps in both apparel and home, with brands like Carter for infants, Nautica for men and Lucky Brand Jeans among our new product offerings.","Health and wellness continues to be a key traffic driver as well and overall, delivered a mid-single-digit comp increase. Hearing Aid Centers achieved double-digit comps for the quarter. We had mid-single-digit comps in OTC and low single-digit comps in prescriptions. Like Walmart U.S., the recent availability of popular prescriptions that have moved from branded to generic status negatively impacted overall sales but drove profitability in unit volume. Rx script count was up mid-single digits, and we expect this trend to continue.","With an eye toward driving growth in eCommerce, we upgraded our checkout processes and enhanced the Click 'n' Pull experience. Our members continue to accelerate their adoption of mobile and tablet technologies as a means of accessing the Sam's Club brand anytime, anywhere. During the second quarter, we had triple-digit increases in daily uses of our mobile applications versus last year.","Membership and other income was up 4.6% versus last year. In other income, similar to the first quarter, we realized a financial benefit that is part of a profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Last year, we recognized this benefit in full at year end. This year, however, we are recognizing this benefit each quarter.","Membership income for the second quarter increased 1.6% versus last year. Remember, for reporting purposes, membership income is recognized over the membership period rather than when it is collected. Renewal performance from primary members remained steady. However, primary new member sign-ups were lower as we anniversaried a special promotional offer from Q2 last year. Plus membership continues to grow versus last year, and we were pleased with the number of members who upgraded to the Plus membership level during our July eValues Savings Celebration. Business add-on memberships remained soft as we continue to see small businesses manage their budgets tightly. While our paid primary membership base is increasing year-over-year, we have an opportunity to accelerate that rate of growth.","Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 5 basis points in the second quarter. Our clubs continued to manage expenses and leverage wages. Productivity initiatives are well underway to continue to improve leverage.","Through our upgraded scheduling system, we are focused on ensuring more associates are serving members during peak shopping periods. Our member engagement surveys continue to show that members are pleased with the manner in which associates are delivering value in the clubs, validating that we can be efficient without sacrificing service.","Units per labor hour were up 2.5% versus last year. The wage gains were partially offset by investments in other areas. One of those areas was marketing. Compared to last year, we have stepped up our marketing activities, and expenses are higher in this area. During the quarter, we began testing new ways to better engage prospective and existing members. For example, we're testing a new communication campaign that includes television, radio, billboard and digital media in certain metro markets. As you know, Sam's has not historically used TV advertising, so this is a more integrated and aggressive approach. Our tagline is: more in savings, more volume and more excitement.","We continue to innovate in our clubs with the expanded rollout of self-checkout and are on track to be in half of our clubs by the end of the third quarter. Clubs with self-checkout have higher member engagement scores around fast than those without self-checkout.","We are very pleased with our inventory sell-through during the second quarter, particularly in such seasonal merchandise as lawn and patio. Inventories grew 8.5%, primarily due to inflation, early merchandise flow and new items in certain categories. Inventory growth, with fuel, was 8.4%. Clubs are clean and have transitioned from summer to the fall season.","We finished the second quarter with strong profits. Operating income, without fuel, increased 10.8% to $512 million compared to last year. Our new club performance continues to exceed projections. During the quarter, we opened one new club in Denham Springs, Louisiana and relocated a club in Worcester, Mass. We also completed the expansion of our club in Monroe, Louisiana. I'm really excited that next quarter, we plan to open as many as 7 new clubs. It's been a long while since we opened that many new clubs in a quarter, and our team is energized about this rate of new growth.","Looking ahead, we expect inflation to have less contribution to the top line, though we continue to monitor the impact of the drought on certain foods. We expect comp club sales, without fuel, for the 13-week period from July 28 through October 26 to increase 3% to 5%. Last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 5.7% for the comparable 13-week period.","Overall, Sam's Club is very well positioned for the rest of the year. We're investing in price and moving to even greater value for our members. We continue to add new brands, especially as we strengthen our offerings in apparel and home, and we remain focused on improving membership sign-ups.","Now I'll turn the program over to Charles for a wrap-up and guidance. Charles?","Charles M. Holley","Thanks, Roz. As Mike said, sales and earnings were strong in the second quarter, and our associate morale continues to be strong as well. Customers and shareholders alike are seeing greater value from Walmart. Heading into the second half of the year, we feel very good about our momentum, especially in our Walmart U.S. business.","Last quarter, I shared with you 4 key operating goals for having a successful year. Let me review each of these goals. The first goal, Walmart U.S. must continue its momentum. Walmart U.S. is delivering a broad assortment at the lowest price, and you heard today that customers continue to respond well. With the right mix of local relevance in every store, the breadth of assortment allows us to take better care of our customers. We have now delivered positive comp sales for 4 consecutive quarters. Our marketing is reinforcing our strong price positioning, and we believe this places us in a great position for the third and fourth quarters.","Second goal, Sam's Club must continue the success it has experienced over the last several quarters. Sam's continues to deliver solid comp growth on top of last year's strong performance. Members are seeing greater quality, and we're providing superior value for the membership fee. Technology applications and operational initiatives, like self-checkout, are adding to an improved shopping experience.","Third goal, we must improve profits and returns in Walmart International, especially for Brazil and China. Internationally, our more mature markets continue to generate the majority of our revenue and profit growth. We have seen the U.K., Mexico and Canada markets provide a solid growth foundation, and we expect that will continue through the rest of this year. We've shared that we still have challenges in Brazil and China, and results won't be quick. But with the leadership teams in place, along with our focus on Every Day Low Prices, we believe we're on the right path.","Last goal, we must expand our capabilities and increase sales in our Global eCommerce business as we integrate multichannel offerings for customers across markets. We're making progress on these eCommerce efforts, and you will continue to hear more about these activities throughout the year. You heard some specific examples earlier in the operating segment discussions, and you will hear more at the annual investor meeting in October.","On the corporate side, we continue to implement process improvements, like our SAP initiative, which allows us to manage our global business more efficiently. Like the operating segments, our corporate and shared service areas are just as focused on reducing cost and improving efficiencies.","Overall, we've delivered solid comp growth in our U.S. businesses this quarter, having built on the success of the first quarter. All markets within International had positive comp sales. We grew earnings per share in the second quarter 8.3% despite significant currency impact to the top line and profits, and we leveraged operating expenses. We added 120 net new stores for 6 million new square feet of selling space.","We were able to deliver these results because of our commitment to the productivity loop. It's not just about Every Day Low Price. Yes, we need that, but we can only drive EDLP because of our relentless focus on reducing costs. Recall that beginning this year, our goal is to reduce SG&A as a percentage of sales by at least 100 basis points over 5 years. We are off to a good start this year.","We're taking pure cost out of the business, empowering our associates and investing savings back into price reductions or profitability. The result is we are more productive for customers across our markets and for shareholder value. A few examples would include: standardizing replenishment systems to improve inventory flow; expanding the store scheduling systems to better meet peak customer demand; using market and customer data from our Global Customer Insights Group to help merchants make better decisions on items and to gain sourcing efficiencies; and consolidating our Latin American financial shared services locations into a single center in Costa Rica to allow for less costly overhead and more efficiency in our back office. You'll hear more examples at the October investor conference.","Let me comment on our returns to shareholders. We continue to prioritize dividends and share repurchase as key uses of our cash, and we have generated free cash flow of $6.1 billion so far this year. You heard the details earlier from Jeff on our dividend payout and share repurchases. We remain committed to providing strong returns to our shareholders.","Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2012, was 18.1% compared to 18.4% for the previous year. I'd like to point out that the 18.1% is flat with the ROI we reported last quarter, indicating that we are moderating our normal seasonal decline. Looking forward, we will continue to strengthen our capital efficiency model in support of our growth.","During the rest of the year, we will add a significant number of units in the United States. Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club are on track with their expansion plans, but you also heard earlier from Doug about changes in the International growth plans and the resulting impact. Our new corporate CapEx forecast for fiscal 2013 is $12.6 billion to $13.5 billion and 36 million to 39 million square feet for the total company.","So how are we set up to deliver for the third quarter? Clearly, you should expect consistency as we execute our strategies. As Mike said, the paycheck cycle remains pronounced, and there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the global economy. Despite this uncertainty, we feel confident in our ability to deliver for our customers and shareholders.","Putting together our forecast requires a little bit of science, history and art. We look at an incredible amount of data, including macroeconomic information, global indices and the needs of our customers around the world. Currency will likely continue to impact our top line and operating income.","For the Q3 period, Bill and Roz shared the comp forecasts, 1% to 3% for Walmart U.S. and 3% to 5% for Sam's Club. Our fundamental business assumptions are still in place, and we expect continued sales growth on a consolidated basis of around 5% for the full year. We expect gross margins to continue to decline slightly as we invest in price. We also expect to incur approximately $35 million to $40 million in expenses for the review of matters relating to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act during each of the remaining quarters for this fiscal year. In addition, as Jeff noted, we estimate our full year tax rate to be around the low end of the range we have previously provided of 32.5% to 33.5%.","Taking all of this into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 to range between $1.04 and $1.09, and this compares to $0.97 last year. For the full year, based on the economy, currency and the current momentum of our businesses, we are increasing our full year EPS range to $4.83 to $4.93. We are also narrowing the range by 50%, and we remain committed to share repurchase as long as it continues to create value for our shareholders. This is factored into our guidance as well. We expect to continue delivering solid financial performance and value to our shareholders.","One last thing before I close. Walmart, along with a number of other leading merchants, forms the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, a new company dedicated to offering consumers a versatile mobile commerce application. MCX is committed to providing a mobile commerce solution capable of seamlessly integrating a wide range of consumer offers, payments and retail programs. This solution will be available through virtually any smartphone and will reduce unnecessary cost, keeping with Walmart's mission to save our customers money.","Thank you for your interest in our company, and I hope to see many of you at the annual investor meeting in October."],"21661":["Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February 21, 2017  7:00 AM ET","Executives","Steve Schmitt - Vice P Investor Relations","Doug McMillon - President and Chief Executive Officer","Brett Biggs - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Steve Schmitt","Good morning and thank you for joining us to review Walmart\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results. This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is February 21, 2017. On today\u2019s call, you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO; and Brett Biggs, CFO.","This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is at the end of this call.","As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation, which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the Investors\u2019 portion of our corporate website stock.walmart.com.","For fiscal year 2017, we utilized the 52-week comp reporting calendar. Our Q4 reporting period ran from Saturday, October 29, 2016 through Friday, January 27, 2017. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release will be on Thursday, May 18, 2017 and our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be held Friday, June 2 on the University of Arkansas campus here in Fayetteville.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon.","Doug McMillon","Good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings materials this morning, we delivered a very solid quarter. And it\u2019s great to see continued momentum in the business.","Total revenue grew 3% in the quarter and increased 3.1% for the year, both in constant currency. Comp sales growth of 1.8% in the Walmart U.S. business this quarter was better than expected, and I\u2019m particularly pleased with the traffic in our stores. U.S. GMV grew 36% in the quarter, so we\u2019re headed in the right direction with this important part of our business too.","Our international business again delivered solid sales growth in constant currency last quarter and Sam\u2019s Club delivered its best comp sales growth of the year. I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s happening at our company. We\u2019re moving with speed to better serve our customers every day and progressing against our four key objectives, which are: make every day easier for busy families; change how we work by becoming a more digital enterprise; deliver results and operate with discipline; and be the most trusted retailer.","Brett\u2019s going to take you through the financials, but before he does, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our accomplishments from this past year that are positioning us to win in the future.","Let me start with our Walmart U.S. business. It all starts with our associates. And I\u2019m pleased that in addition to increased wages, we deployed more sophisticated tools to assist our associates to meet the needs of customers. New technology and apps are providing real-time information to improve our in-stock levels and better manage inventory, which is down 7% this quarter versus last year on a comp-store basis.","We\u2019ve also invested in training academies for associates to further develop the skills they need to better serve customers and succeed in today\u2019s retail environment. We expect to train more than 225,000 department managers and hourly supervisors by this fall. In fact, I recently visited a store in Morrisville, North Carolina, where they had reduced inventory so significantly that the backroom was empty enough for them to build a training academy there. These initiatives are paying off for our customers through cleaner stores, friendlier service and faster check-out times.","Greg Foran and the team continue to innovate to improve the customer experience. In the last month, we opened two new Supercenters in Florida and Texas, with features like scan-and-go, touch-screens where customers can access more items on Walmart.com, virtual item displays, and an integrated Health & Wellness section.","We got quite a few experiments going on in the company these days and we\u2019re learning at a faster rate. We\u2019ve also been investing in price and customers are responding. We\u2019re confident the continued execution of our strategy will drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales.","Shifting gears to our International segment, I\u2019m pleased to see the business delivering consistently solid sales results. While Walmex led the way this year, our performance was broad based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales for the year and seven of those markets grew comp sales by more than 4%.","At Walmex, we continued to see strong momentum in the business across formats and countries. Comp store sales growth was over 7% this year and 14% on a two-year stack.","In China, we announced an alliance with, and investment in, JD.com last summer, improving our e-commerce proposition and extending the reach of Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club brands to millions of new customers. We subsequently announced an increased ownership of JD.com to approximately 10%. And we recently furthered this relationship with the launch of an exclusive Walmart Global Imports Store on JD.com Worldwide, which provides Chinese customers access to thousands of products imported from Walmart stores from around the world.","We also announced an investment in last mile delivery-company New Dada, enabling two-hour delivery service from nearly 70 Walmart locations. China is a key growth market for our company and we\u2019re proud of how we positioned the business to win.","In the UK, we faced some challenges this past year and we\u2019re addressing these with urgency. We\u2019re encouraged comp store sales improved during the fourth quarter. I visited stores in the market a few weeks ago and the team has us pointed in the right direction. We spent considerable time looking at our international portfolio last year and we took some decisive action along the way.","For example, our decisions to divest noncore businesses such as an apparel chain in Mexico and shopping malls in Chile were based not on the merits of their performance, rather their relevance to the portfolio. We must ensure that we focus on businesses that are core to what we do. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the consistently solid sales results in International. We have a strong business with good momentum.","Moving to Sam\u2019s Club, I\u2019d like to start by thanking Roz Brewer for her leadership. Sam\u2019s Club comps improved each quarter during the year last year and she has positioned the business for further progress. With Roz\u2019s departure, we promoted John Furner to CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. John\u2019s been with the business since 1993, working in Walmart U.S., International, and most recently, as Sam\u2019s Chief Merchandising Officer. He brings a unique set of experiences and a deep understanding of our company. He\u2019s going to be a great leader for Sam\u2019s.","We\u2019re pleased with our progress in technology at Sam\u2019s, including the national launch of scan-and-go. E-commerce continues to grow with direct-to-home and Club pickup. While we have more work to do to deliver the results we expect to achieve, we believe we\u2019re on the right track to win with members and accelerate growth.","Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss our progress in e-commerce, particularly in the U.S. We continue to invest in e-commerce to accelerate growth. We\u2019re gaining traction and moving faster. We\u2019re the second-largest U.S. online retailer by revenue, one of the top three online retailers by traffic and our Walmart app is among the top three apps in retail. We acquired Jet.com in the second half of last year and welcomed Marc Lore, the CEO of our U.S. e-commerce business. Marc is moving quickly.","From a marketplace perspective, we now have over 35 million SKUs, more than quadrupling the number available at the beginning of the year. We recently announced free two-day shipping on millions of items with a minimum order of $35. And as you might expect, we\u2019ve seen a nice uptick in our e-commerce business since this launch. The acquisitions of ShoeBuy and Moosejaw, in addition to Hayneedle, gave us immediate expertise and capabilities in new, more upscale categories of merchandise.","We\u2019re also leveraging the strengths of Walmart and Jet to make both platforms better. I\u2019m excited about what\u2019s to come. I\u2019m really pleased by how Greg Foran and his team are working in tandem with Marc Lore and his team to deliver the convenient shopping our customers desire, no matter how they choose to shop. They will continue to partner closely to serve our customers seamlessly across our app, site and stores.","Over the holidays, wait times were down for Pickup and we\u2019re adding more items to Pickup Today. Customers love being able to order an item with an app and get it that day.","In conclusion, as I step back and look at the retail landscape, customer expectations continue to change rapidly. They will increasingly expect even more personalization and convenience in their shopping experience. We\u2019re moving quickly to respond to the current opportunities as well as to innovate and transform the shopping experience for our customers in the future.","According to Bain, Black Friday weekend sales marked the first time the number of people shopping online surpassed people shopping in stores, and over half did so through mobile devices. And more than 70% of traffic to Walmart.com during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by mobile. While e-commerce is growing rapidly customers continue to rely on brick and mortar formats.","The Supercenter remains the best retail format in the world, and going forward, we will continue to leverage these unique assets, even more with initiatives like online grocery, in-store pickup and others. Rapid advances in technology mean we need to become more of a digital enterprise - and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","So in summary, we have a clear strategy we\u2019re executing against; we\u2019re uniquely positioned to deliver value unlike any other retailer through both physical and digital assets; we have momentum across the business which positions us well for the new fiscal year; and while we must do more, we believe we\u2019re on the right track as we work to be the most trusted retailer for our customers, provide ongoing opportunity for our associates and deliver results for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll give you to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Good morning, everyone. As Doug mentioned, this has been an exciting year of transformation at Walmart. We\u2019ve made strategic decisions revolving around the customer that will reposition the business for sustainable growth to win long term. We\u2019re moving with speed to provide customers with a better offer through stores, mobile and e-commerce. And we\u2019re confident this will drive value for shareholders. And, while going through this transformation, our financial strength serves as a great competitive advantage.","For fiscal year 2017, there were a number of accomplishments, I\u2019ll highlight just a few. Constant currency net sales were up nearly 3%, a growth of $13.7 billion. Operating cash flow reached $31.5 billion, an all-time record for Walmart. E-commerce GMV growth accelerated throughout the year. Adjusted EPS of $4.32 exceeded our initial full-year guidance. GAAP EPS was $4.38. It has been a very successful year in a number of ways.","Now, let\u2019s discuss the results in more detail, starting with the fourth quarter. Total revenue, excluding an unfavorable $2.6 billion currency impact, increased 3% to $133.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, we added $3.7 billion in net sales. It\u2019s important to note that currency impacts on net sales during the quarter were about $600 million higher than anticipated versus when we began the quarter, driven primarily by the depreciation of the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar.","Walmart U.S. delivered strong top-line performance with comp sales of 1.8%, exceeding guidance. International continued its steady constant currency top-line performance with another solid quarter, and Sam\u2019s Club comp sales of 2.4% were better than expected, with continued strength in e-commerce and omni-channel initiatives. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.30, which was near the upper-end of our guidance range.","Walmart\u2019s consolidated gross profit margin increased 5 basis points in the quarter with expansion in both International and Sam\u2019s Club. Walmart U.S. gross margin declined in the quarter. I\u2019ll get into more detail on this in a moment. Total operating expenses increased 58 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to ongoing investments in people and technology.","In both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we adjusted for discrete items. These included $939 million in charges for store closures across all segments last year as well as $370 million for discontinued real estate projects and severance in the U.S. this year. For comparison purposes, excluding these discrete items for both years, operating expenses increased 97 basis points in the quarter. Now that we will be lapping the U.S. wage increases from fiscal year 2017, we would expect to slightly lever expenses in fiscal year 2018.","I\u2019ll provide more details about operating segment performance shortly, but let me first spend a few minutes on e-commerce where we\u2019re changing rapidly and remaining laser-focused on our customers. Globally, on a constant currency basis, e-commerce sales and GMV increased 15.5% and 17.5% respectively. Excluding Yihaodian, GMV increased 29.7%.","Going forward, we plan to discuss e-commerce results a little differently from the past in order to give you a clearer view of our performance, particularly in the important U.S. market. Given the organizational framework changes over the past few months, we will no longer be discussing global e-commerce as we have in the past.","Sam\u2019s Club e-commerce, and the various international e-commerce initiatives, will be discussed as appropriate within those segment discussions. As we discuss Walmart U.S. eCommerce, which is led by Marc Lore and represents the largest portion of our e-commerce effort, note that it includes all web-initiated transactions including those through Walmart.com such as ship to home, ship to store, pick up today, and online grocery, as well as transactions through Jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.","We saw strong growth this quarter in the Walmart U.S. eCommerce business with GMV and sales growth of 36% and 29%, respectively. Our integrated offering means customers are shopping with us through multiple channels. In fact, over the holidays, Pickup Today, which is available in Walmart U.S. stores, grew by 27% over last year.","We are seeing the benefits of our e-commerce investments. During the holiday period, the e-commerce fulfillment network performed very well, supporting record volumes with on-time delivery rates that far exceeded last year. This network is also the backbone of the new free 2-day shipping promise with a $35 minimum order available at Walmart.com. Customers are responding well to this new offer, and ecommerce sales have strengthened since its launch on January 31.","Looking ahead, you\u2019ll continue to see us make investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition. We\u2019re excited about the things we\u2019re doing, the speed at which we\u2019re doing them, and the work we still have to do.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to make excellent progress on working capital, with $11.9 billion in operating cash flow and $8.7 billion in free cash flow. Working capital has been a focus for us all year. And I\u2019m really pleased with our discipline, particularly in managing inventory and payables.","For the year, we generated $31.5 billion in operating cash flow and $20.9 billion of free cash flow. This was an increase in free cash flow of nearly $5 billion, or more than 30%, versus last year. This is a great testament to Walmart\u2019s financial strength. When you consider that we were able to reduce our net debt levels this year while also making strategic decisions to grow the business both organically and through M&A, including investments in stores, logistics, people and technology, it\u2019s a fantastic achievement.","We accomplished this while also returning a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. In fact, over the past year, we returned $14.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As of the end of the fiscal year, we had used approximately $10.8 billion of the current $20 billion share repurchase authorization.","Additionally, today we announced an increase in our annual dividend from $2 per share to $2.04 per share in fiscal 2018. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend for 44 consecutive years. We\u2019re proud of our track record of returning significant cash to shareholders, while investing in future growth.","Let\u2019s now discuss the results for each operating segment in more detail, starting with Walmart U.S. We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum in Walmart U.S. with steady improvement in stores, strong growth from e-commerce and growing contributions from the rollout of Online Grocery. We\u2019ve now seen nine consecutive quarters of traffic growth in our stores. Clearly, we\u2019re gaining traction and it\u2019s exciting to see how customers are responding to our focus on saving them time and money.","For the quarter, strong comp sales growth of 1.8% was driven by a 1.4% increase in customer traffic. All store formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 40 basis points to the segment. We were particularly pleased with the positive comp in Grocery despite ongoing market deflation in food, which negatively impacted the Food comp by approximately 90 basis points.","Throughout the 6-week holiday season, customers responded well to consistent everyday low prices and a simplified integrated multi-channel experience that enabled last-minute shopping so they could find the perfect item. Gross margin decreased 8 basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise as well as lower logistics costs benefitted the margin rate, but were more than offset by the continued execution of our price investment strategy and the timing of post-holiday markdowns.","We\u2019re entering the New Year in a very solid inventory position. For the year, Walmart U.S. gross margin increased 24 basis points. As a reminder, both fourth quarter and full-year comparisons included a $56 million impact last year related to store closures. Operating expenses increased 4.6% this quarter and 8.1% for the year, primarily due to the associate wage rate increases as well as investments in technology and e-commerce.","As I mentioned previously, in both this year and last year we adjusted for discrete items. This year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $249 million charge related to discontinued real estate projects. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter included $670 million in charges related to the impact of store closures. Excluding these adjustments, operating expenses would have increased 7.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.","Walmart U.S. operating income declined 2.5% in the fourth quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the discrete items discussed earlier, Walmart U.S. operating income declined 10.4% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year. The Walmart U.S. team continues to do a great job with inventory while maintaining high in-stock levels. Inventory declined 3.1%, with comp store inventory down 7.2%, despite strong sales growth.","To wrap up Walmart U.S., we made a lot of progress this year in providing customers value and convenience. While sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which we believe is due in part to the delay in tax refunds versus last year, we expect comp sales for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017 to increase between 1% and 1.5%.","Now, let\u2019s move to Walmart International. Walmart International continued its solid sales performance this quarter. While Walmex results were the strongest with comp sales growth of 7%, the solid international performance was fairly broad based. 10 of our 11 markets posted positive comp sales and six of those markets grew comps by more than 4%.","For the fourth quarter, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.1%, impacted by a $2.6 billion currency headwind. For the year, net sales grew 3% on a constant currency basis, while reported net sales declined 5.9%, impacted by an $11 billion currency headwind.","From a profitability standpoint, fourth quarter operating income increased 3.8% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019d like to point out that there were a few items in the quarter that collectively had a negative impact to operating profit of approximately $100 million, primarily because of adjustments to useful lives of certain assets and impairments in certain markets, which were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the remaining shopping malls in Chile as mentioned last quarter.","Operating income for the year increased 19.7% on a constant currency basis and increased 7.7% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results include the gain associated with the sale of Yihaodian and the items mentioned above.","Let\u2019s now turn to some brief highlights of the key markets. Please note that the accompanying financial presentation includes detailed information on our five major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.","Let\u2019s begin with Walmex. Strong sales momentum continued across all formats, divisions, and countries with total sales growing nearly 9% in the quarter. In Mexico specifically, comp sales increased approximately 8% and outpaced all divisions of ANTAD, including self-service, specialty, and department stores.","In Canada, net sales increased 2.7% and comp sales increased 0.2%. According to Nielsen, we continued to gain market share in traffic driving categories like food and consumables, and health and wellness.","Turning to the UK, net sales declined 0.6% and comp sales declined 2.9% in the quarter. We have a lot of work to do in this market, but we\u2019re encouraged by some of the early signs of traction with improvements in the customer value proposition. In China, net sales grew 5.4% and comp sales increased 2.3%. Sales were solid across hypermarkets and Sam\u2019s Club. We\u2019re excited about the future of e-commerce in China.","The strategic alliance with JD.com will continue to expand our presence throughout the country, and offer customers new and exciting products through our flagship sites on JD\u2019s platform. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with the consistent performance from our international portfolio and excited about the new fiscal year.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Sam\u2019s Club. At Sam\u2019s Club, we\u2019re pleased with the efforts underway to transform the business. We\u2019re making progress in a number of areas, and we know we have to move faster to provide the value that members expect.","During the quarter, top-line performance was driven by an increase in comp sales, excluding fuel, of 2.4%. Samsclub.com GMV was strong, increasing by 25%, and Club Pickup also performed well. Operating income, excluding fuel, declined 5.1% for the quarter. Investments in associate wages pressured expenses, along with charges related to the impairment of clubs.","In addition, this year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $10 million discrete charge for discontinued real estate projects, while last year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $57 million discrete charge related to the impact of club closures. Excluding these discrete items, operating income would have declined 14.6% this quarter.","For the year, net sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.8% to $53.3 billion. Operating income, excluding fuel, declined 7.3%. Looking ahead, for the 13-week period ending April 28, 2017, we expect a comp sales increase of around 1%.","With that, let\u2019s discuss guidance for the total company. At our October investor meeting, we guided that fiscal 2018 full-year EPS, based on currency rates at that time, would be relatively flat to adjusted full-year fiscal 2017 EPS, and we still expect that to generally be the case. However, since then, the U.S. Dollar has strengthened, in particular versus the Mexican Peso, which negatively impacts our Walmex projections on a U.S. Dollar basis.","We also expect our tax rate next year to be higher than the rate for fiscal year 2017, which was positively impacted by transactions such as Yihaodian during the year. We expect fiscal 2018\u2019s tax rate to be around 32%, assuming no major changes to the tax environment in our major markets. As always, there can be variability from quarter to quarter.","Certainly, we are aware of and engaged in the discussions around tax reform in the U.S. As more information comes to light, we will continue to provide updates if any of our assumptions were to materially change. When taking all this into consideration, we expect fiscal 2018 EPS to be in a range of $4.20 to $4.40 compared to fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $4.32. This assumes an expected currency impact of about $0.05 per share.","As stated in October, we expect operating income to decline slightly in fiscal 2018, driven in part by continued strategic price investments, partially offset by a more disciplined approach to expenses. We would anticipate that EPS in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.90 to $1, which includes an expected currency impact of about $0.02 per share.","Net sales, on a constant currency basis, are anticipated to grow between 3% and 4%. We expect the underlying stores business, in most parts of the world, to continue to deliver solid top line results along with increased growth in our e-commerce business. We\u2019re focused on driving strong efficient growth by opening fewer new stores overall, particularly in the U.S., while prioritizing comp sales and accelerating ecommerce growth, including the third-party marketplace.","Based on current exchange rates, we would anticipate a currency impact on net sales of approximately $3 billion for the year. On a reported basis, we expect net sales growth of between 2% and 3%. There are a number of additional assumptions in this guidance today, including that economic conditions, and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest markets remain generally consistent. Also, as indicated at our October investor meeting, we expect capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions to be approximately $11 billion for fiscal year 2018.","So in closing, I want to thank all of our great associates around the world for the progress we made as a company this past year. As a team, we\u2019ll win with customers by serving them in new and exciting ways, and deliver for our shareholders in this new fiscal year.","Unidentified Company Representative","This call includes certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.","Such forward-looking statements relate to management\u2019s guidance and forecasts as to, and expectations for Walmart\u2019s earnings per share for the three months ending April 30, 2018; Walmart\u2019s earnings per share, operating income, net sales, levering of expenses and effective tax rate for the year ending January 31, 2018; the impact of currency on net sales and earnings per share for the year ending January 31, 2018; comparable store sales for the Walmart U.S. segment and the comparable club sales, excluding fuel, of the Sam\u2019s Club segment for the 13 week period ending April 28, 2017; actions that will drive value for shareholders, future investments in e-commerce to drive traffic and improve the customer value proposition; the benefits of our investments in e-commerce, and the benefits of our alliance with JD.com.","Assumptions on which any guidance or forecasts are based are considered forward-looking statements.","Walmart\u2019s actual results may differ materially from the guidance provided, or the goals, expectations or forecasts discussed in such forward-looking statements as a result of changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or other risks, uncertainties and factors, including: economic, geo-political, capital markets and business conditions, trends and events around the world and in the markets in which Walmart operates; currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in market interest rates and commodity prices; unemployment levels; competitive pressures; inflation or deflation, generally, and in particular product categories; consumer confidence, disposable income, credit availability, spending levels, shopping patterns, debt levels and demand for certain merchandise; consumer enrollment in health and drug insurance programs and such programs\u2019 reimbursement rates; the amount of Walmart\u2019s net sales denominated in the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies; the financial performance of Walmart and each of its segments; Walmart\u2019s ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Jet.com, Incorporated; Walmart\u2019s effective tax rate and the factors affecting Walmart\u2019s effective tax rate, including assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, administrative audit outcomes, impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings between the U.S. and Walmart\u2019s international operations; customer traffic and average ticket in Walmart\u2019s stores and clubs, and on its ecommerce websites; the mix of merchandise Walmart sells, the cost of goods it sells and the shrinkage it experiences; the amount of Walmart\u2019s total sales and operating expenses in the various markets in which it operates; transportation, energy and utility costs and selling prices of gasoline and diesel fuel; supply chain disruptions and disruptions in seasonal buying patterns; consumer acceptance of and response to Walmart\u2019s stores, clubs, ecommerce websites, mobile apps, initiatives, programs and merchandise offerings; cyber security events affecting Walmart and related costs; developments in, outcomes of, and costs incurred in legal or regulatory proceedings to which Walmart is a party; casualty and accident-related costs and insurance costs; the turnover in Walmart\u2019s workforce and labor costs, including healthcare and other benefit costs; changes in accounting estimates or judgments; changes in existing tax, labor and other laws and regulations, and changes in tax rates, trade agreements, trade restrictions and tariff rates; the level of public assistance payments; natural disasters, public health emergencies, civil disturbances, and terrorist attacks; and Walmart\u2019s expenditures for FCPA and other compliance related costs.","Such risks, uncertainties and factors also include the risks relating to Walmart\u2019s strategy, operations and performance and the financial, legal, tax, regulatory, compliance, reputational and other risks discussed in Walmart\u2019s most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.","You should consider the forward-looking statements in this call in conjunction with that annual report on Form 10-K and Walmart\u2019s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Schmitt with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings. This is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team. Hopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning. I'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A.","There will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these statements. Please review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials.","So let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter. We had a really strong quarter. We have broad-based growth. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share.","So we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them. We recently completed a debt tender offer. We made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter. We made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets. So excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1.","We have good momentum in sales growth across the business. Walmart U.S. comp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%. We saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes. Our Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales grew 50%. Sam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes.","International delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales. Excluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us.","We're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S. comp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares.","Just a couple of reminders. We'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website. So please mark your calendars for that.","And at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. We saw a noticeable down trick in your U.S. gross margin even if you back out the hurricane-related impact, and you cited the price investments and the mix shift to eComm. Those have presumably been drags on the gross margin for the last several quarters. So why did it take a noticeable step down this quarter?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Let me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S. basis. So on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points. And you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S. hurricane-related expenses that we had.","I'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts. So just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter.","For Walmart U.S. specifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter. Price investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well. And the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that. So I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price. We're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders. It's really the productivity beginning to turn for us. So you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses. That's our plan.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","And my follow-up question is, Steve, in recent times, there's been talk about Walmart potentially charging higher prices online than in-store. Can you describe the thought process behind that, and the potential risk that customers would experience from having segmented pricing across channels?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Sure. So if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online. The fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thanks, Steve. Nice quarter. Our question is about smart cart technology and how you're thinking about leveraging a lot of the Jet technology, just where you are with that in relation to Walmart? And then secondly, I'd love your thoughts on the Lord & Taylor deal, and just some of the strategic rationale there would be helpful? Thank you.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Oliver. So the first question around smart cart technology. It's something that we continue to look at. We need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart.com, but nothing really more to add at this time.","In terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience. Think about it as a flagship store. This is expected to launch in the spring. It will be dedicated store on Walmart.com and in the app. We're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site. So we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And Steve, some of our work around customer survey satisfaction at Cowen has been volatile. Can you revisit clean, fast, friendly, and is there anything we should note that's happening, and opportunities to continue to enhance customer satisfaction at large?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Well, I think there's a lot of things. If you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S. business, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint. So, we continue to look at it. It's a point of emphasis for us. I think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just lastly, inventories, they were down. They look attractive. Are you feeling like that's a continuation, where we continue to see negative inventories, and are you fine with that relative to in-stock levels and sell-throughs?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","So we're happy with our in-stocks. We continue to make progress on inventory. You've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you. Best regards. Happy holidays.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks. You too.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. First, I wanted to ask about the core business, if we just do some math, excluding some of the hurricane impact. I think if you take out, let's say, the midpoint of 40 basis points from the hurricane and then you add back the EBIT, I think $150 million, it tells that \u2013 U.S. EBIT margins were up a little bit. I'm guessing that's how you're looking at that performance. Just want to confirm that that's a fair way to look at it?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","I think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I don't know if you'll talk about this, but did Jet.com benefit to the comp, and then bigger picture, your eComm was up 50%. I think the out-year guide is a 40%. Is basically \u2013 you're just going to mix out. You're going to \u2013 and Jet was in part of the quarter, I guess, and so it'll fall a little bit out of it in the next quarter. Are you just glide-pathing to that 40%? Is there any change in that growth rate that we should expect going forward?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Well, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up. Jet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work. So there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results.","Really the way we think about eCommerce is really in total. Jet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall. We made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S. eCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole.","In terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business. I think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go. But in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the last piece, in the PowerPoint, you called out automotive is a strong category. Is that growth in services, in unit count on vehicles that you're performing services on or is that in the product side if you know?","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Yes. Simeon, this is Kary. It is on both. Really solid performance in automotive as you've seen over the last number of quarters and it goes from, certainly a step up service aspect but also good price point on things like tires for instance that are driving customers increasingly to Walmart's automotive area.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. I wanted to ask about the food business. You guys called it out, the great comps. Can you give some color on what you guys are doing to make it so strong. Is the online store pick up really supporting those comps significantly? Have you been doing any special promotions in food? Anything on how you're driving that? And then \u2013 and also I noticed, I think the commentary on inflation was that it was the same or maybe even a little bit lower. Can you give us any color on how you guys see the inflation outlook in your food business going forward? Thanks.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Robby. Maybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail. So we'll take the inflation piece first. So the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \u2013 it's \u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter. The fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets. As we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward.","In terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up. We know that that's working for our customers. We continue to expand it. We're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year. So that's a big initiative for us. It's working and our customers love it.","In terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things. It's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well. Kary, anything else you want to add?","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","I think it's great that the customers earlier responded to areas we've spent a lot of focus on, particularly fresh areas, fresh categories and that business has really sequentially improved. Price points are right. There's a good assortment. The presentation within the stores is really, really good. And then top that off with online grocery. So I would say that's certainly key areas on top what Steve said.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is the spread between the comp at a online grocery store versus a Walmart store without it? Is it dramatic? In terms of the comp trending grocery between those two?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","We won't give the specifics of that. But we know it's an initiative. It's working for us based on our rollout plans.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys. I had to try.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Robby. And I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on two things on the U.S. margin specifically. I think (13:55) the first thing is, you actually are now leveraging expenses in the U.S. How should we look at that with labor costs accelerating pretty rapidly?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Okay. So I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business. One of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs. We need to be more efficient. We talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that. We have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have. So that's what we continue to do.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","And then as far as the gross margin...","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","...we've talked about it a little bit. But I was just wondering could you give us any thoughts about freight, a lot of companies we cover had been talking about freight cost going up and that's pressuring them. How should we think about that factor as far as Walmart goes maybe fourth quarter and beyond? Thank you.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. I think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business. We have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception. But I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing. Thanks.","Rob, next question please?","Operator","Yes. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Just a quick question on leverage. So, obviously you saw some pretty good leverage in 3Q and it was, I guess, even higher if we add back a portion of that $150 million hurricane impact. So I guess the question is, is there anything that you could point to specifically that helps you get that leverage this quarter? And how do we think about it from \u2013 and then obviously, I know the comp was strong, so that was part of it. But, how do we think about the sustainability of that into the fourth quarter and beyond?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Well, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped. But it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall. I know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward. There's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall. It's great that we started to see that in the third quarter. We've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that. But it's not one thing, it's a lot.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, in the commentary on U.S. merchandise highlights, you included the comment about improvement in private brands. Any color you could give, maybe in terms of how many SKUs you added, anything? I know you're really reluctant to directionally give a penetration number. But if there's any color you could give on that, that would be great.","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Sure, Karen. Penetration does continue to grow. And I think what's great about this is it spans multiple categories. You think about areas like food, where we're introducing different private brands. You saw an announcement earlier this quarter about our Baby, and improving the private brand offering within our Baby categories, certainly in consumables, health and wellness, you have a good selection. So it's a key area of focus for us, as you've heard from Greg. Often, we think there's an opportunity there to give an improved quality at the right price point for the customer, and that will continue to be a focus.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And the percent penetration, will we ever get that?","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Not today.","Karen Short - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Karen. Rob, next question please?","Operator","The next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to hit on pricing real quick. Was there any change sequentially in the pricing strategy? And did the return of inflation play a role in the impact on the gross margin? Because obviously, it's harder to invest in price in an inflationary environment. I'm wondering if it's simply more of the gross margin pressures, because the costs are cupping (18:01) back, and it's more costly to invest in price in that type of environment.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks for your question. So, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now. The details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest. So pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line. So we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a follow-up on grocery. I think you said comps were up low single digits in the category, in food. It seems like hurricanes would have an outsized impact here, and just based upon the tone out of Doug, it certainly seemed like there was an acceleration sequentially. Excluding the hurricanes, did that business still accelerate sequentially?","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","We've seen really improving trends overall over the last number of quarters in the grocery business, and it really gets to a lot of the things we've talked about earlier on the call. More discipline around, stepped-up presentation for the customer, good assortment, our fresh business has improved, price points are right. So the customers are increasingly coming to Walmart. Traffic continues to improve in the grocery business as well. And ticket is falling, we talked about increased units. So certainly, hurricanes are a factor within the number, but you've seen continued improvement in the grocery business, as we've spoken about over the past year.","Edward J. Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Doug spoke in his prepared remarks that both new and old customers are adopting some of the online efforts. I was hoping you guys could dig into the new customer bucket, and if there's any way you could quantify that for us? Is it a younger customer, and how do you cultivate that new shopper so that she keeps coming back, both online and in-store?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Well, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S. population in general. We're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers.","So we continue to push that forward. In terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information. But we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways. We're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year. We'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, thanks. And follow-up would be, in the past you guys did a lot of survey work on the health of the consumer. Wondering if you guys are still doing that? And then when you look at the acceleration in your comp, how much of it do you think is you versus any macro tailwinds that are out there?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","We do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck. So there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer. The real \u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well. We haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Just my last quick one would be, just on inflation, U.S., you said it was up about 30 basis points in the U.S., but Sam's it was up closer to 70 basis points. I'm wondering why such a divergence between the two segments?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","That's really a different product mix and more than anything.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Thanks.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thank you for your questions.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. The first one is, within the U.S. business, the comp store sales, was there any variability month-to-month that you would call out? And I was wondering if you could give us an update on the associate delivery test underway, how that's going?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. In terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing. It's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have. But not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers. So we continue to watch that and learn from it.","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","As far as business performance month-to-month, we really don't get into those details. There's just a lot of noise and variability from holiday shifts and otherwise. And certainly with the hurricanes there was increased noise. So overall where we land it was in a pretty good spot.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","And nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the electronics category both online or also in the store, just how you're thinking about that heading into holiday?","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Yeah. We have a great holiday planned. We think we've put together something we work on for a long time and even spend some time with kids and picking out toys and electronics that they increasingly use. And so we think we have a good assortment of product for the holiday that will appeal to a large portion of customer. And I think we'll have that assortment available in a big way both in-store and online.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to circle back to Sam's Club, nice acceleration in comp. If you can just flesh that out for us, seems like you certainly expect this trend to continue given the 4Q guidance. Also, if you can touch on any membership trends coming out of Sam's? And then just as my follow-up, if you can just go into maybe a little bit more detail on how the hurricanes impacted this quarter, particularly on the margin side, just a little bit more detail on that would be helpful?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Maybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul. In terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S. business, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit. Sam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points. We talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S. \u2013 Walmart U.S. business and about $20 million for Sam's. So I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint.","In terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic. So a 3.6% member traffic growth. We have members coming in more frequently. We have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs. And that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks so much. My first question relates to health and wellness, where I think you saw comps accelerate to mid-single digits from low single digit. Anything in particular drive that pickup in momentum?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Matt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance. There was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. Second question I want to ask real quick. So you said you gave us all the detail you could on the storms, I'm going to try to go slightly deeper into one. If you think about that comp benefit that you discussed, would you expect that that would have benefited ticket or traffic, if you could differentiate?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Probably both. I mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. That's helpful. And then finally, just to get clarity on where some of the one-time items that are excluded from adjusted earnings are showing up in the divisional P&L. Should the FCPA be taken out of unallocated, and the international real estate taken out of International?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","See from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall. And one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up. So if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. Thank you so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is a little bit bigger picture in nature, but you've pursued a lot of different strategies with buying brands in some cases, like ModCloth and Bonobos, and then partnering in other cases, like with Lord & Taylor. Can you just walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy of acquisition versus partnership, and why one way makes sense versus the other, depending on what that relationship is?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","I think the key is to be flexible. If you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense.","You have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms. And then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties. So I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I can ask a second question, unrelated. Do you have any perspective on the impact of door closures, more from the mid-tier channel that you could be benefiting from? Obviously the demographics are a little bit different, but do you have any measures that you're picking up share from that area in particular, either with ladies apparel or any other category?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","I think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel. But, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share. It's hard to dissect on who from. So I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you. But thanks for your question, Kate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. My question was around Jet.com and Walmart.com. I had ordered something on Walmart.com recently, and noticed that I got a discount for accepting a delivery time that was beyond the two days, and that's very Jet.com-like, and I'm wondering how much of Jet.com type discounts Walmart.com will be integrating into its own website, such as discounts for using debit versus credit or volume buys or skipping free returns, et cetera.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks for the question. I think it's TBD. I think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward. So we've got a lot of ideas. We have a lot of initiatives underway. A lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about. So I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And then my second question was around pricing, and I imagine when you started the pricing campaign, the lower prices, you had to expect that some would respond. What I'm curious about is, to the extent that you can comment on it, to what extent are you cutting price further as a competitor comes in and gets close or matches where you are?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","We certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time. So we continue to do that. Our brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Good morning, Scot.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So my question is, let's assume half the hurricane impact was on traffic, half was on ticket. Is there anything you guys can point to that cause average ticket to spike up this quarter, especially, given your continued price investments?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Bigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot.","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Yes, we definitely sold more units and our \u2013 again, this gets back to some of the areas that we've talked about already on this call. The food business being very strong, health and wellness continues its good trends. And we saw a pickup in some general merchandise categories as well. Areas like hard-line, automotive performed quite well again this quarter and even saw a tick up in apparel. So, all those are contributing to the overall ticket performance.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just a housekeeping item. I didn't see it in the release. Do you guys have the number of SKUs that were available on your eComm platforms at the end of the quarter?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","It's over 70 million.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Over 70 million. And what does that compare to Steve?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","In the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million.","Kary Brunner - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","That's right.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","So we continue to make progress.","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up. Do you guys worry about going too high end again? You know I know like we saw you add a KitchenAid, you've got this relationship with Lord & Taylor. And I feel like in the past there was a time and maybe it wasn't so much that you went high end, but the stores maybe got very cleaned up and things were almost too nice for a little while. But is there any risk of alienating your core customer with some of these new higher end brands?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks for your question, Joe. And we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us. So, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data. We analyze the data really well. We know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website. We think it helps the brand overall. So we'll watch brands like that. We're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then another, just a quick follow-up, just shift gears to international for a second. The UK, we've seen second quarter now positive comps. Is it simply the price investment that you're getting back in line with the right to be more competitive or are there other things going on that are helping to drive the comps in the UK?","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","I think pricing is a piece of it. But I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there.","Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter.","Steve Schmitt - Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, guys. We appreciate. We don't have any more questions in the queue. So I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the fourth quarter and full year results of fiscal 2014. The date of this call is February 20, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Walmart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way. ","This call will contain statements that Walmart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call. ","Our press release and transcript are available on our corporate website \u2013 stock.walmart.com. Please also note that we have two additional releases out this morning. One release announces our annual dividend for fiscal 2015, and a second details our small store expansion strategy in Walmart U.S. for this fiscal year. ","As a reminder, for fiscal 2014 which ended Jan. 31, 2014, we utilized a 53-week comp reporting calendar, with the 53rd week being included in the Q4 reporting period. Back in our Q3 earnings release, we provided you with an adjusted fiscal year 2013 Q4 14-week comp for comparability to our Q4 comp guidance for this fiscal year. Our Q4 reporting period began on Oct. 26, 2013 and ran through Jan. 31, 2014. ","Consistent with industry practice, we will not adjust the reported fiscal 2014 comps. Therefore, for this year, quarter-to-date and year-to-date comps will be based upon 13- and 52-week periods, respectively, compared with 14-week and 53-week periods that we reported in fiscal 2014. We have posted a week-by-week comp reporting calendar under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website. ","In case you missed it, Walmart issued a pre-release about fourth quarter earnings on Friday, Jan. 31. That release updated EPS guidance, and included comments on comp sales performance. We refer to that release a number of times during this call. It\u2019s also available on the website. In this quarter we have significant discussion about underlying performance. Underlying EPS \u2013 by Walmart standards \u2013 is calculated to adjust for the impact on the company\u2019s reported EPS for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of certain discrete items that totaled $0.26 per share and that occurred in the fourth quarter. ","Additional information regarding this term \u2013 underlying EPS \u2013 and others used in today\u2019s release including constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate, are also available on our website. ","One last reminder: As many of you know, on Monday, February 24, we will co-host our annual international meeting for the investment community with Walmex in Mexico City. For those of you unable to join us, the meeting will be webcast in both English and Spanish, and can be accessed via the investor portion of our corporate website, as well as the Walmex site. ","So, now let\u2019s get down to our agenda for today\u2019s call. Doug McMillon, who took over Feb. 1 as president and CEO of Wal- Mart Stores, Inc. will cover key results and provide an overall assessment of our strengths as he leads us into fiscal 2015. 3 Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP of finance and treasurer, in her first call as Walmart\u2019s treasurer, will cover the financial details for both the fourth quarter and the full year. ","Then, we\u2019ll cover the operating segments. Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., followed by David Cheesewright, who succeeded Doug as president and CEO of Walmart International on Feb.1. Rosalind Brewer, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, will follow Dave. Charles Holley, Walmart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with an analysis of how we did on our financial priorities of growth, leverage & returns, and as always, he\u2019ll cover guidance. ","Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our new CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug?","Doug McMillon","Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to share with you how excited and humbled I am to serve as the CEO of Walmart. It\u2019s truly an honor to lead this company and serve our associates. We have a dedicated team of associates around the world who work hard every day to deliver on our purpose. As I complete my third week in this role, I appreciate the support from Mike and the leadership team on carrying out a smooth transition. Being part of Walmart for over 23 years gives me some perspective and appreciation of the past, but most of all, I\u2019m excited about our future. ","Now, let\u2019s get to the business of today. On a consolidated basis, Walmart\u2019s underlying EPS rose 2.0% for the full year to $5.11, including the fourth quarter\u2019s EPS of $1.60. On a reported basis, EPS for fiscal 2014 decreased 3.2% to $4.85, including $1.34 in the fourth quarter. Claire will cover the details behind our EPS shortly. 4 ","Our company added $11.9 billion in net sales on a constant currency basis this year to reach more than $477 billion, an increase of 2.5% over last year. This excludes the negative impact of more than $5 billion from currency exchange rate fluctuations and an approximately $730 million benefit from acquisitions. While we made operational adjustments to lower our expense base, they were not sufficient to deliver leverage for the full year. ","Consolidated underlying operating income rose 0.2%, but on a reported basis, operating income decreased 3.1% for the year. Walmart U.S. was a key contributor to our overall profit growth, with operating income up 4%. ","Walmart U.S. also added almost $5 billion in annual net sales. We were encouraged by our comp performance in the first half of the fourth quarter, including the holiday period. But, like many other retailers, weather got the best of us throughout the back half, resulting in a fourth quarter period comp decrease of 0.4%. It\u2019s a credit to Bill and his team that Walmart U.S. leveraged expenses and invested in price for our customers. ","Sam\u2019s Club had the strongest annual membership income growth in many years, driven primarily by the fee increase. But, net sales grew more slowly than expected. Roz and the team have taken steps to rebalance Sam\u2019s operational structure and enhance merchandise offerings. We expect these actions to provide a foundation for future growth and further benefit our fiscal 2015 financial results. ","Walmart International delivered solid constant currency net sales growth to reach almost $141 billion, including more than $39 billion of constant currency net sales in the fourth quarter. The team improved operational efficiencies to lower expenses and reduce inventory, and this will continue to be a priority. ","I\u2019m pleased to have Dave Cheesewright leading Walmart International. Since joining the Walmart family over 15 years ago, Dave has been instrumental in strengthening our business, as well as gaining market share in our international markets. I\u2019ve seen Dave make tough strategic decisions to better position us for long-term success, and I\u2019m confident that his leadership will serve associates, customers and shareholders well. ","Each operating segment strengthened its e-commerce platforms, and customers responded, driving annual Global eCommerce sales above the $10-billion mark, a 30% increase, including sales from our Yihaodian acquisition. We know that technology is changing how customers around the world shop, and we are changing with them. Under Neil\u2019s leadership and with company-wide support, we will continue to invest in this area that is critical to our success. ","I\u2019d like to spend my remaining time with you outlining what I see as Walmart\u2019s strengths that we will further capitalize on, and the areas that make me so excited about our company\u2019s future. One of Sam Walton\u2019s fundamental principles that I really like is that we need to serve Walmart customers around the globe as if they\u2019re our boss, because they are. Listening to our customers and exceeding their expectations are the keys to our success. I will lead Walmart with a customer-centric focus. ","I am working with the leadership team on enhancing the business to improve our customer relevance. We have a compelling customer proposition, but we can get better at running some of our core operations, and we will. ","Walmart has a long history of embracing change. And this year, we\u2019ll certainly make some changes to improve our business. These changes will be made with a filter on increasing customer relevance. Customers\u2019 shopping habits are changing more rapidly than ever before. We must be more nimble and flexible as we operate our businesses to adapt to these changes. So, our focus is to invest in the capabilities that connect with customers on their terms. ","We can accomplish this by accelerating our growth across the enterprise. This includes delivering improved comp sales by sharpening our EDLP focus and increasing merchandise innovation to drive more traffic. Comp sales improvement is a key priority, and we\u2019ll use a combination of price investment and enhanced service to accomplish this. ","We will also continue to get closer to our customers and provide them with additional shopping options. In the U.S., we see a great opportunity to accelerate our small format store rollout to complement Walmart\u2019s core supercenter fleet. Customers want this convenience, and they are responding by driving strong comps at existing small formats. You\u2019ll hear more from Bill about this shortly. ","We also see an environment to create transformative growth in Global eCommerce and mobile commerce. Our ability to combine online and mobile with the assets of the world\u2019s largest retailer positions us to win at the intersection of physical and digital retail, which is a competitive advantage. ","Over the past year in particular, we have invested more significantly to improve our customer experience and fulfillment capacity. Cycle times on e-commerce related to capital investments are much more fluid than those for stores, so we can move faster and make decisions with speed. We\u2019ll increase our e-commerce investment as opportunities present themselves. And, we\u2019re committed to updating you more often on this important growth area. ","Another area of focus is on operating with excellence. I am a firm believer in EDLP, because it builds customers\u2019 trust in Walmart. EDLP is a competitive advantage, and we will continue to transition the rest of our international markets to this pricing strategy. ","With EDLC, we can lower our cost structure so we can pass on savings to customers. Our operational excellence mindset compels us to deliver expense leverage by growing sales and driving the productivity loop. We\u2019ll also improve our capital efficiency in our core business and foster an environment that leverages best practices. ","Our goal is to become the model of excellence in global compliance and ethics, and we\u2019ve made significant progress on this commitment during the year. We also will continue to lead on social and environmental issues that build public trust with key stakeholders. ","I\u2019m proud that Walmart enables and empowers associates with opportunities to succeed. My career is testament to this. I\u2019m also grateful for the opportunity I was given, starting as an hourly associate, to learn the business and what it takes to be a good merchant. And of course, we never stop learning. ","In fact, when I was riding along with one of our trucks delivering a load to a supercenter on my first day as CEO, the driver, Rickey, displayed a personal passion for serving customers. I saw that same passion from Rosie, one of our department managers, in a Memphis store last week. I was reminded how each of us, regardless of our roles at Walmart, has an important responsibility to serve our customers to the best of our abilities. ","And because of this, we will continue to invest in and develop talent that will move us into the future. This is really critical to our success. Before I close, I want to appreciate Mike Duke for his service and accomplishments as CEO over the past 5 years and throughout his 18-year career with Walmart. ","Mike was instrumental in positioning Walmart for long-term success by making critical investments in technology and talent. He also broadened our company\u2019s commitment to lead on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of our times. Under Mike\u2019s leadership, the company delivered strong financial results, and total shareholder returns improved dramatically. ","Without question, Mike\u2019s passion for retail and drive for continuous improvement has benefitted Walmart\u2019s associates, customers and shareholders. As you\u2019ve heard these past few minutes, we have much to achieve this year, and this will inevitably include change. But things that won\u2019t change include our core beliefs, our winning culture and our purpose of serving customers so that they can save money and have the freedom to do more with their hard earned money. ","I\u2019m confident in our very strong leadership team and our more than 2 million associates to deliver for Walmart\u2019s customers, shareholders and each other. I\u2019m honored to lead this incredible company and optimistic about our future. In this changing retail environment, Walmart will lead. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?","Claire Babineaux-Fontenot","","Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll begin by going through our fourth quarter P&L results and wrap up with a summary of our full year. ","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.34, compared to $1.67 last year. On January 31, we updated EPS guidance, including details on a number of discrete items, which impacted our fourth quarter results. ","The total EPS impact of these discrete items on continuing operations for the quarter and the year was $0.26 per share. A detailed explanation for each of these items is indicated within today\u2019s press release. The discrete items and the respective EPS impact were as follows: Brazil non-income tax contingencies $0.06, Brazil employment claim contingencies $0.05, Brazil and China store closures $0.06, China store lease expense charges $0.03, India transaction $0.05, Sam\u2019s Club U.S. staff restructuring & club closure $0.01 Therefore, our underlying EPS \u2013 meaning EPS excluding the discrete items \u2013 was $1.60. ","Last quarter, we also increased our full-year estimate for our incremental investment in e-commerce to $0.10. However, during the fourth quarter, this investment was approximately $0.04 per share, bringing the total fiscal 2014 incremental investment in e-commerce to $0.11 per share. ","Consolidated net sales increased 1.4%, or $1.8 billion, for a fourth quarter total of $128.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales would have increased 2.8% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter to $130.6 billion. ","With respect to comp sales, total U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.4% for the 14-week period ended January 31. Bill and Roz will provide more details for Walmart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club. ","Consolidated membership and other income increased 12.7% to $920 million. The increase was primarily driven by the sale of certain real estate assets within our U.S. segments, which was recognized in other income, and a solid 9.0% increase in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club. ","Strategic price investment within all three operating segments contributed to a 40 basis point reduction in our gross profit rate, bringing it to 23.9% for the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.9%, an increase of 73 basis points, driven primarily by Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart International. ","Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 71 basis points. Excluding the impact of discrete items, operating expenses as a percentage of sales, would have increased 2 basis points to approximately 18.2% compared to last year. ","Corporate & support expenses, which include core corporate, Global eCommerce support, and Global leverage services, increased 8.3% for the quarter. Core corporate expenses increased 5.8%. FCPA and compliance-related expenses were approximately $58 million, which was below our guidance of $75 to $80 million for the quarter. ","Approximately $38 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while the remaining $20 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have increased 6.3%, primarily driven by technology investments for people systems and training. ","Fourth quarter operating income decreased 14.4% to $7.3 billion. Discrete items impacted operating income by 10.6%. Excluding the impact of discrete items, operating income would have decreased 3.8% to $8.3 billion. ","Net interest expense increased 16.1% to $554 million. The increase was primarily driven by interest accruals related to non-income tax discrete items in Brazil and higher debt balances, offset by a reclassification of certain international accounts payable discounts to cost of sales. ","This leads us to income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart of $4.4 billion, a decrease of 21.0% compared to last year. Discrete items impacted income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart by 15.5%. Excluding the impact of the discrete items, income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart decreased 5.5% to $5.3 billion. ","Capital expenditures were approximately $3.6 billion for the quarter. We added approximately 9.9 million retail square feet through 206 net new, expanded and relocated units.","Moving on to returns, during the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 11.2 million shares for approximately $877 million and also paid $1.5 billion in dividends. That wraps up our report of Q4. ","Now, let\u2019s review highlights for the entire fiscal year. For fiscal year 2014, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $4.85, versus last year's EPS of $5.01, a decrease of 3.2%. Our underlying EPS increased 2.0% to $5.11. Our effective tax rate was 32.9%, compared to 31.0% for the prior year. This was within our full year guidance of 31 to 33%. ","Consolidated net sales were $473.1 billion, an increase of $7.5 billion, or 1.6%, over last year. Acquisitions added approximately $730 million to net sales, while fluctuations in currency negatively impacted net sales by $5.1 billion. Therefore, on a constant currency basis, net sales would have increased 2.5% to $477.5 billion. For the 53-week period ended January 31, U.S. comp sales, without fuel, decreased 0.4%. ","While our gross profit grew 1.5%, our gross profit rate declined 3 basis points to 24.3%, which reflects our ongoing investment in price, as well as our global merchandise mix. For the year, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 27 basis points to 19.3%. ","Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 19 basis points. Excluding the impact of the discrete items, operating expenses as a percentage of total sales would have increased 8 basis points to 19.1%. ","Corporate & support expenses increased 24.1% for the full year, primarily from our investments in leverage services and Global eCommerce. Core corporate expenses, which included $282 million in charges related to FCPA matters, increased 15.6%. ","Approximately $173 million of these expenses represented costs incurred for the ongoing inquiries and investigations, while the remaining $109 million was related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements. Excluding these FCPA and compliance matters, core corporate expenses would have increased 6.7%. ","Now, turning to our full year operating income\u2026 Operating income decreased 3.1% to $26.9 billion. Discrete items impacted operating income by 3.3%. Excluding the discrete items, operating income would have increased 0.2% to $27.8 billion. ","Income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart for the full year decreased 5.7% to $16.0 billion, compared to $17.0 billion last year. Discrete items impacted income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart by 5.0%. Excluding the discrete items, income from continuing operations attributable to Walmart would have decreased 0.7% to $16.9 billion. ","Consolidated inventory grew 2.4%, driven primarily by both U.S. operating segments. You\u2019ll hear more from the segment CEOs regarding the individual drivers of inventory growth. ","We ended the year with capital expenditures of $13.1 billion, slightly above our range of $12.0 to $13.0 billion, primarily the result of additional small format activity in Walmart U.S. For the year, the company added approximately 32.6 million retail square feet through 529 net new, expanded and relocated units. You will hear more from Bill and Charles on our revised fiscal 2015 capital expenditure plan. ","With respect to leverage, our debt to total capitalization was 42.6%, compared to 41.5% last year. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended January 31 was $10.1 billion, a decrease of $2.6 billion. The timing of tax payments, as well as slightly higher capital expenditures, were the primary drivers of the reduction. ","Return on investment for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2014 was 17.0%, compared to 18.1% last year. The reduction in ROI is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income, investments in fixed assets, and the impact of acquisitions. Discrete items impacted return on investment by 40 basis points. Excluding the impact of discrete items, ROI would have been 17.4%. ","The company repurchased approximately 89.1 million shares for $6.7 billion and paid $6.1 billion in dividends. As of January 31, 2014, we have approximately $11.3 billion remaining under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization.","Now, let\u2019s turn it over to our operating segments. We\u2019ll start with Walmart U.S. Bill?","William Simon","Thank you, Claire. In the fourth quarter, the U.S. retail business environment was challenging. It was marked by a shortened holiday season, severe winter storms, and reduced government benefits. While these factors impacted our business, they also brought out the best in our associates and have further cemented our customers\u2019 reliance on our commitment to price leadership. ","Net sales grew by $1.8 billion or 2.4%. For the 14 weeks ending January 31, comp store sales were down 0.4%, with ticket up 1.3% and traffic down 1.7%. In the absence of a reduction of government SNAP benefits, which represented approximately 40 basis points of impact to comp sales, we believe the quarter would have been flat. Additionally, comps were pressured by winter storms, which forced the closure of over 200 stores at some point over the course of quarter. ","While we\u2019re disappointed with comp sales, there are a number of things that made me particularly proud. We kicked off the season with a successful Black Friday event, led by strong customer response to the one-hour-guarantee program. We followed that with an excellent Cyber Monday, which marked the biggest sales day in walmart.com\u2019s history. ","I\u2019m pleased with our event execution and coordination between our online business and our physical stores. Our commitment to price leadership, aggressive marketing and strong execution helped us deliver a positive sales comp during the 6-week holiday season ending December 27, 2013. ","Due in large part to our holiday performance, we gained share across all of our tracked general merchandise categories, including entertainment, toys, automotive, stationery, home and apparel, for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group. ","In addition, we continue to be pleased with the strength of our small formats. These stores continue to deliver positive comp sales and traffic increases each quarter. In fact, comp sales, without fuel, for Neighborhood Markets grew approximately 5% for the 14-week period. ","Now, let me share more detail about the financial results for the fourth quarter. We had modest year-over-year operating income growth to $6.4 billion. Gross profit increased 0.8%, with our gross profit rate down 41 basis points, driven primarily by a commitment to price leadership. ","Our customers rely on us to deliver low prices on the items they want most. We believe our price investment was a material driver to accelerated share gains and positive comps during the holiday season. ","We delivered 17 basis points of expense leverage. For the quarter, expenses increased only 1.4% in spite of headwind related to group health care costs. The operations team executed holiday plans extremely well and efficiently transitioned stores between a normal day-to-day business and holiday events to serve a record number of customers during the Thanksgiving week. ","In fact, during the peak 4-hour period, our associates processed more than 10 million transactions. That\u2019s over 40,000 transactions per minute. We also benefitted from a $33 million gain related to the sale of real estate that was recorded in other income. ","Q4 inventory grew 3.8%, moderating from prior quarters, but still higher than the rate of sales. We remain committed to disciplined inventory management and are well positioned for spring seasonal conversion. Now, let me cover some of the highlights from our merchandising areas. ","Grocery, which includes food and consumables, gained 24 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ending February 1, 2014 according to The Nielsen Company. Our overall grocery comp was in the low single-digit negative range, due in part to SNAP benefit reductions. ","Excluding those impacts, we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying business. We saw strong mid-single-digit positive comps in produce and adult beverages, which benefitted from enhanced quality and price investments. Additionally, we had positive comps in other fresh departments, including meat, deli and bakery. ","Health & wellness continued its momentum, delivering a low single-digit positive comp. Our prescription business was particularly strong, with a mid-single-digit positive comp due in part to inflation. This helped offset pressure from a soft flu season, which also adversely impacted our over-the- counter business. ","Hardlines, including seasonal, had a low single-digit positive comp for the quarter. Our Christmas seasonal business performed well, with strength across the entire business, including lights, trees, and d\u00e9cor. Hardware and paint, as well as automotive, also delivered solid comps, with strong sales in cold weather categories, such as car care and heaters. ","Entertainment, including toys, posted a mid-single-digit negative comp. However, we were able to grow market share. Our one-hour guarantee program, the \u201cChosen by Kids\u201d program and a strong Black Friday event performance led to share gains for the 13 weeks ending January 4, 2014, according to The NPD Group. While we were pleased with our share performance, we continued to face challenges related to ongoing entertainment industry contraction. ","Our home business reported a low single-digit positive comp. Broad assortment helped both bath & bedding, as well as cooking & dining, deliver strong mid-single-digit positive comps. National brands such as Calphalon, Farberware, Keurig, and SodaStream also drove traffic and sales growth in home. ","Our apparel business delivered a low single-digit positive comp, with strength across several categories. Sales of national brands, such as Avia and Russell, led the way during the quarter. Cold weather apparel and active wear posted particularly strong comps. ","I\u2019m happy to report that our e-commerce business continued to perform well. For the fourth quarter, it contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Walmart U.S. comp. As I mentioned, we had our strongest Cyber Monday ever. Customers are rapidly adopting mobile, and we\u2019re evolving quickly by enhancing the experience through improved apps. Continued enhancements of our e-commerce platform and fulfillment network are top priorities, and we invested strategically to strengthen these areas. ","Our Texas dotcom fulfillment center processed more orders than planned, and our new Pennsylvania center opens within the next few weeks. The strategic location of these fulfillment centers complement others already in place and allow us to reduce the time to deliver merchandise. ","Now, let me now cover the financial results for the full year. During the fiscal year, net sales increased $5.0 billion, or 1.8%, to $279.4 billion. Comp sales declined 0.6% for the 53-week period ending January 31, while operating income grew 4.0% \u2013 or more than twice the rate of sales \u2013 to $22.4 billion. ","Gross profit for the year increased 1.8%, with a slight gross profit rate decline. Price investments were offset by cost of goods savings initiatives. ","Expenses were up 0.9%. We successfully leveraged each quarter of the year. Within our supply chain, logistics utilized optimized routes and distribution center mechanization to drive efficiencies. Store operations leveraged technology investments, such as self-checkouts and MyGuide, to improve associate productivity. ","We\u2019re proud of our ongoing commitment to expense leverage. Since fiscal 2010, we\u2019ve delivered 83 basis points of cumulative leverage. Those savings allow us to invest in price and fuel the productivity loop. ","Despite improvements in overall operational efficiency, group health care expenses were a headwind for the year and will continue to be in fiscal 2015. As our health care plans already exceed the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, we didn\u2019t expect the implementation of ACA to materially impact our benefits costs. However, we\u2019ve experienced higher-than- anticipated enrollment. This has placed pressure on our benefits expense. We\u2019ve accounted for this in our financial guidance and will monitor it closely throughout the year. ","With regards to real estate, our strategy is centered on providing customers access to the broadest array of products through a digitally connected, multi-format portfolio. To this end, we accelerated the growth of our small format stores. We added 105 new Neighborhood Markets this year, bringing our current fleet to 346 total units. ","These stores delivered an approximately 4% sales comp for the year, driven by fresh and pharmacy. In fact, our Neighborhood Market fleet is performing comparable or favorable to leading grocers around the country. We also opened 7 Walmart Express units this year, bringing the total to 20. We continue to learn from these stores and are excited by the options this format offers. ","Supercenters will also continue to play a role in our overall growth and are essential to the grocery stock-up and broader shopping trips. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we opened 130 units this year. ","Let me share with you some positive developments in our growth plans. Recall in October that we announced plans to build 120 to 150 new small stores for fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve been working to improve our speed to market and lower capital costs to allow us to move more aggressively. ","I\u2019m very pleased to announce that we\u2019re further accelerating our small store growth and now anticipate opening between 270 and 300 this fiscal year. Our customers\u2019 needs and expectations are changing. I believe these stores will enable us to exceed their expectations by providing convenience and easy access to fresh foods, pharmacy and fuel. Through the intersection with walmart.com, we can connect our physical asset base to the broad assortment that is available online. ","These increases will nearly double our small store fleet, driving retail growth as we enter the next generation of retail. Including expansions, conversions and relocations, we will deliver 385 to 415 new units versus our prior guidance of 235 to 265 new units. Total incremental square footage is anticipated to be between 21 and 23 million square feet, versus our previous guidance of 19 to 21 million square feet. ","Given the small format acceleration, we are also updating our capital expenditure guidance, from a range of $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion to a new range of $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion. ","We currently have over 4,200 stores and will grow that significantly this fiscal year. Our full fleet will serve as the physical access points for our digital business, combining these two worlds in a unique way. Site to Store, Ship from Store, Pay with Cash, and Scan & Go are great examples of what we\u2019re currently doing to marry digital and physical experiences. ","In October, we expanded the grocery delivery test to the Denver market, and we\u2019re getting a great response. Almost 90% of the customers rate the service above average or outstanding. And just last month, we announced an easy pick-up option for online grocery and general merchandise orders in Denver. We\u2019re leveraging our global learning from the Asda Click and Collect program, a highly successful model. And, we\u2019ll continue to innovate in this space and invest in meaningful opportunities. ","Reflecting on the year, I\u2019m really proud of the impact we\u2019re having on our customers and communities. We launched our veterans hiring program in May and have since hired more than 30,000 honorably discharged veterans. We\u2019ve also made great strides in our domestic manufacturing initiative. ","Our activity to date will lead to the creation of an estimated 58,000 new U.S. manufacturing-related jobs. We have strong commitments from suppliers and recently announced a $10-million, 5-year Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund to spur innovations that support America\u2019s growing manufacturing footprint. ","For fiscal 2015, we\u2019re focusing on growth and returning to positive comps. We\u2019ll leverage what\u2019s already working well in areas, such as home, apparel, and produce, and continue to drive improvement in opportunity areas such as dry goods, snacks & beverages, consumables, and entertainment. ","We\u2019ll also address underperforming stores. We recognize the need to win at the convergence of digital and physical, and we\u2019ll leverage our more than 4,200 stores as access points for our digital business to further spur growth through e-commerce. And, of course, we\u2019ll do this in the Walmart way \u2013 leveraging expenses and remaining true to our everyday low price promise. ","In the first quarter, we expect the retail landscape to remain challenging. Comp sales were down at the beginning of the 13-week period, due largely to continued winter storms. However, we\u2019re encouraged by our underlying business trends and anticipate a positive sales comp for the balance of the quarter. Therefore, we expect a relatively flat sales comp for the 13-week period ending May 2. Last year\u2019s 13-week comp ending April 26, 2013 was down 1.4%. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David for an update on Walmart International. Dave? ","David Cheesewright","Thank you, Bill. Let me start by saying how honored I am to lead Walmart\u2019s growing international business. I\u2019m proud to be part of such a strong leadership team that is committed to advancing our global mission of saving people money so they can live better around the world. ","As we\u2019ve said for some time now, we\u2019re operating in a challenging global environment, with low inflation, relatively high unemployment and fragile consumer confidence leading to modest consumer spending. Having said that, we\u2019re aggressively focused on leading the business with a long-term view on our customer, and we\u2019re confident that our teams are aligned on the right strategies to succeed and deliver our core mission. ","Our strategy is a simple promise of being in good businesses and running them well. This lays the groundwork for delivering our financial priorities \u2013 growth, leverage and returns. We\u2019ve initiated actions in Mexico, Brazil, China and India to improve our operating model in those key countries, and this will continue to be a priority this year. ","Looking forward, we\u2019re focused on several key areas: \u2022 First is to deliver on our role of being a strong growth vehicle for the company. This can come in many forms, but we will continue to focus aggressively on driving comp sales in each of our markets. This is the most efficient manner for us to drive top-line as well as returns. ","We will be the lowest cost operator in each market. We\u2019re in good shape in many markets, but we have room to improve everywhere. Driving the productivity loop is core to our operating model and how we serve our customers. We will be passionate about price leadership wherever we operate. ","We will build a platform for profitable growth in China. We\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made here and will continue to make this a priority. We\u2019re focused on stabilizing Brazil. This has been a challenging market for a number of reasons, and we\u2019re working on many fronts to improve our competitive position here.","I\u2019m very excited about our continuing growth in e-commerce globally. It\u2019s a big part of our plans going forward, and we\u2019re working closely with Neil\u2019s team around the world to ensure we\u2019re leading at the intersection of physical and digital. Just in the last year, we\u2019ve grown Yihaodian and Brazil ecommerce sales at nearly twice the market rate. ","We\u2019re also seeing great progress in the U.K., Canada and Mexico. Let me remind you of our announcement on February 6 of the completion of our purchase of approximately 25% of the shares of Walmart Chile from certain minority shareholders. As a result of this transaction, Walmart now owns approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of Walmart Chile, and we recently launched a cash tender offer for the remaining shares. We believe in the potential of this market, and this purchase continues Walmart\u2019s growth strategy. ","Let\u2019s now turn to our results for the fourth quarter. Claire has provided detail on the discrete items that I\u2019ll be referring to. On a reported basis, International net sales were $37.7 billion, down 0.4%, with currency exchange fluctuations unfavorably impacting sales by approximately $1.8 billion. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4.3%. ","Around the globe, the holiday season was softer than we would\u2019ve liked, particularly in our larger markets, as we continue to see customers manage on a relatively tight budget. Gross profit rate, on a reported basis, fell 53 basis points and on a constant currency basis, decreased 44 basis points. ","This was primarily driven by price investments in Brazil, Canada and Mexico. 21 Relatively soft sales, along with the previously disclosed discrete items, impacted our ability to leverage expenses during the quarter. Operating expenses increased 12.5% on a reported basis, and increased 18.8% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating expenses by 13.2 percentage points. Excluding these items, operating expenses would\u2019ve grown 5.6%. ","We are disappointed in our leverage performance for the quarter. As always, our teams are focused on operational efficiency and are making progress on several cost reduction initiatives. For example, in the U.K., plans are in place to roll hybrid checkout registers across 130 stores in early FY 15 and to expand on global scan and go initiatives. Mexico is improving associate productivity by optimizing modular, financial and promotional planning to drive improved layout accuracy and in-stock. ","On a reported basis, operating income decreased 45.8%, compared to last year and decreased 44.3% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating income by 37.8percentage points. Excluding these items, operating income would\u2019ve declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher operating expenses and price investment. Inventory grew faster than sales, but we\u2019ve made significant progress across our markets. ","Let\u2019s turn to the results for the year. For fiscal 2014, reported net sales were $136.5 billion, growing 1.3% over last year. Currency exchange fluctuations negatively impacted sales by approximately $5.1 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 4.6%. ","This is the first quarter our Yihaodian acquisition is included in our constant currency numbers. During the first three quarters of the year, Yihaodian contributed $730 million in sales, which were not included in our constant currency results.","We are especially pleased that in this tough environment, we grew market share in most countries and maintained share in a challenging Mexico market. We did experience share loss in the U.K. and Brazil. Competitors remained very aggressive with vouchering in the U.K., and around the world, we continue to focus on expanding price leadership. ","Operating expenses on a reported basis were $27.4 billion, up 5.5%. On a constant currency basis, expenses increased 9.7%. Discrete items impacted operating expenses by 3.6percentage points. Without these items, operating expenses would have grown 6.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by headwinds in Brazil and Mexico and investments in e-commerce. ","The combination of soft sales, price investments, higher expenses, and investments in e-commerce, caused operating income for the year to decrease 17.6% on a reported basis and 14.8% on a constant currency basis. The discrete items impacted operating income by 13.8percentage points. Without these items, operating income would have declined 1.0% on a constant currency basis. ","Now let\u2019s turn to the individual market results. As a reminder, the following discussion is on a constant currency basis and, unless otherwise stated, net sales and comp sales are presented on a nominal, calendar basis. In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. For Brazil and China, we discuss stores and e-commerce separately. ","For the fourth quarter, net sales in the U.K. increased 1.3%, while comparable sales declined 0.2%. We are pleased that traffic increased 0.2%, offset by a ticket decline of 0.4%. Gross profit rate was flat for the quarter, as sourcing benefits and efficiencies were invested into maintaining a strong price position. ","The U.K. macroeconomic environment improved slightly in the fourth quarter with GDP growth of 0.7% and unemployment falling to a four-year low of 7.1%. However, the macro picture is masking a slower recovery from a consumer perspective, with staple item price inflation continuing to outstrip personal earnings growth. ","In this tough economic environment and with inflation slowing, total market growth for the 12 weeks ending January 5 was relatively modest at 2.9%. With online growth and a growing discount sector, all major retailers, including Asda, had overall share declines. ","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose by 18 basis points. Headwinds in indirect taxation, employment costs and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by cost discipline across operations. We improved check-out efficiencies, procurement savings on supplies, supply chain efficiencies and energy savings, and we expect to deliver more benefits this year. Due to the expense headwinds, operating income decreased 1.5%. ","Inventory was reduced 2.7%, driven by improved stock to sales control, as well as the conversion to the Global Replenishment System earlier in the year. ","We recently announced a new strategy at Asda that we expect will redefine value retailing in the U.K. This will involve improving our core business by investing UK1.25 billion in price and quality over the next 5 years. We will bring this value to more customers by improving access and reach across the U.K., focusing on online growth and expanding stores into the faster growing South East and London markets. ","We became the first mainstream U.K. retailer to introduce a Black Friday event. Special prices across electronics and toys, procured with our global sourcing team, helped drive strong traffic growth, with 450,000 additional transactions on the first day of the event. We started off the New Year with a 50-pence store event designed to provide customers value when they need it most. ","Our multichannel offering in the U.K. continues to strengthen, and online sales increased 18.6%. We added 87 Click & Collect sites in the U.K., including 6 Underground station locations as part of an innovative collaboration with Transport for London. We also added 160,000 square feet of net selling space within the quarter, adding stores in carefully selected areas, bringing access to new customers. ","We continue to focus on supporting local communities in the U.K. Over the year, we raised over UK7 million for a number of national charities and community organizations, exceeding our goal by 36%. ","In Canada, fourth quarter net sales grew 0.4%, while comp sales decreased 1.7%. Comp traffic decreased 2.7% with ticket increasing 1.0%. The decrease in comp store sales was due to several factors, including exceptionally severe winter weather during December, declining consumer spending and price competition. ","Although we saw solid low single-digit comps across the board in food and consumables, this was offset by our Walmart discount stores, which struggled particularly in electronics and hardlines. ","Despite the soft comp sales, we achieved an overall increase of 45 basis points of market share according to The Nielsen Company\u2019s measured channels for the most recently reported 12-week period ending January 25. We remain excited about our e-commerce business. In fact, we had our best online sales day ever during our Black Friday event. For the quarter, online sales grew 145%. ","Our gross margin rate decreased 88 basis points due to continued aggressive price investment. Operating expenses grew 0.9%. Higher costs for utilities, maintenance and repair, and investments in e-commerce were offset somewhat by store wage leverage. As a result of this, operating income decreased by 5.3%. Despite the sales softness, inventory was well managed, with total inventory flat to last year. ","During the fourth quarter, we completed 9 new supercentres, 5 expansions and 7 in-box conversions in Canada. For the year, we added 10 net new stores, bringing our total count to 389 retail locations. In addition, we recently announced a C$500 million capital investment to continue our growth for stores and e-commerce. ","Now, let\u2019s move to Africa. As you know, Massmart is a publicly held subsidiary that operates in 12 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its fiscal year ends in December and the company will release its year-end results on February 27. We are pleased with the progress our management team is making in this market. ","Now let\u2019s move on to our larger Latin American markets. The following summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America and is on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported fourth quarter results on February 18, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex-reported numbers. Our Mexico results exclude the impact of the pending Vips sale, whose operations results are recorded in discontinued operations. ","For the quarter, Walmex consolidated net sales grew 3.5%. Gross profit rate decreased 44 basis points, driven by a decrease of 77 basis points in Mexico. Central America had a 183 basis point increase in gross profit rate that was driven by better markdown management and merchandising mix. Walmex operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 72 basis points. Operating income decreased 8.1%. ","In Mexico, net sales increased 3.1% over last year, but comparable stores sales decreased 1.6%. Sales were negatively impacted by the country\u2019s continued economic slowdown and especially soft performance by Sam\u2019s Club. ","Mexico\u2019s self-service formats \u2013 Bodega Aurrera, Superama and Walmart Supercenters \u2013 plus Sam\u2019s, lagged the market by 60 basis points. Excluding Sam\u2019s, our self-service formats, outpaced the market by 70 basis points. ","Gross margin declined 77 basis points as a result of price investment and an aggressive competitive environment. Operating expenses increased 9.0%, and operating income declined 10.3%. Operating expenses were negatively impacted 3.3percentage points by a non-cash charge to rent expense to properly state certain store lease liabilities. Excluding this item, operating expenses would\u2019ve increased 5.7%. Operating income was impacted by 3.8 percentage points, resulting in a comparable operating income decrease of 6.5%.","Inventory grew faster than sales, but inventory quality remains good, and we expect to right-size our position in the first quarter. ","During the quarter, we opened 100 net new stores and 211 during the year to bring our total store count to 2,199. ","For fiscal 2015, we expect continued economic pressures, including a new tax on high-calorie food and beverages, and an increase of VAT in border cities. We expect moderate improvement in the economy, driven by government investment and increased remittances from the U.S. ","In addition, our co-branded credit card agreement with BBVA Bancomer ended, which is having some impact on extending and usage of credit for our customers. We are exploring strategic alternatives to strengthen the financial service offerings to our customer. ","Mexico is reinforcing its fundamentals and is reaffirming its price leadership position in the market. In our Sam\u2019s Clubs, we\u2019re improving the value proposition for our members by offering better assortment and lower price points. ","We continue to invest in and are pleased with our e-commerce sales growth. According to Comscore, we are the third most visited site in Mexico, and according to Euromonitor International, we are number one in online grocery sales due to our Superama delivery program. ","We are encouraged by the performance of Central America, where net sales increased 6.1%, with comparable store sales increasing 1.8%. Gross profit rate increased 183 basis points, due to improved markdown management compared with the prior year. ","Operating expenses increased 9.5% and operating income increased 39.4%. Operating expenses were impacted 3.7percentage points by the similar rent expense charge as mentioned earlier with Mexico. In addition, operating income was also impacted by 19.6percentage points by the rent charge. Excluding this charge, operating expense grew 5.8% and operating income increased 59.0%. ","During the quarter, we opened 4 net new stores and 19 during the year, bringing our total store count in Central America to 661. ","Moving on to Brazil, fourth quarter net sales grew 5.3%, with total comp sales up 4.6%. We\u2019ve seen improved performance in our retail formats, driven by our food and consumables categories, but wholesale formats remain soft. Average ticket grew 8.0%, and traffic declined 3.4%. Gross profit rate decreased 328 basis points, as we continue to invest to drive price leadership. We\u2019re driving the productivity loop, with investments in systems integration in both retail and wholesale formats. ","Operating expenses were up 75.2%, resulting in an operating loss for the quarter. The discrete items mentioned earlier impacted operating expenses by 68.5percentage points. Excluding the discrete items, operating expenses increased 6.7% and resulted in a smaller operating loss. ","Confronted with wage inflation, the Brazil team has responded with productivity initiatives to help offset these headwinds. As a result, labor productivity for the year increased approximately 7%. ","With a new site launched in October, Brazil\u2019s e-commerce continued its strong track record of sales growth and market share gains. We had a strong performance in unique visitors during the period. The top-performing online categories included phones, phone accessories and electronics. For the year, online sales grew at about twice the rate of the market. ","Our position in Brazil remains challenging, but we are implementing a number of initiatives to stabilize the business and to put us on a stronger foundation going forward. Now let\u2019s move on to Asia. Walmart China sales grew 3.7% during the fourth quarter, with comp sales up 0.4%. Comp was driven by an 8.6% increase in ticket, while traffic declined 8.2%, as customer behavior continued to shift towards fewer trips and larger baskets. ","Gross profit as a percentage of sales during the quarter improved 42 basis points as \u201cBuy 4 Less\u201d initiatives delivered cost savings even with investments in price. China had an operating loss for the quarter, driven by expense growth of 34.2%. However, expenses were impacted 38.8percentage points by the discrete items. After adjusting for the discrete items, expenses decreased 4.6%, and operating income increased by 416.4%, measured against a relatively low base. ","On a full year basis, China\u2019s sales grew 4.3%, with comp sales growth of 0.7%. Operating income decreased 139%. The discrete items impacted operating income 177.5percentage points. Excluding the discrete items, operating income would have increased 38.5%. ","We\u2019ve made progress on our \u201cWorry Free\u201d price campaign in China. Continued price investments, supported by our \u201cBuy 4 Less\u201d initiatives, have saved customers money, while increasing full year gross margin by 11 basis points versus last year. ","The China strategy embodies our \u201cEvery Day Low Cost\u201d philosophy, and we continue to lower expenses and increase wage productivity. Operating expenses were up 11.3% for the year. The discrete items impacted operating expenses by 9.9percentage points. Without the discrete items, operating expenses would have increased 1.4% for the year. ","The overall market in China remains challenged, due to headwinds from the ongoing government austerity campaign on gift giving, as well as price deflation in key categories such as liquor, edible oil and rice. ","Yihaodian sales grew at triple digit rates, significantly outgrowing the market. In Q4, we improved our customer experience by recombining the marketplace with the Yihaodian site. We continue to be the top seller of key merchandise, such as imported foods, including milk, which is helping to drive loyalty and repeat visits. ","Turning to Japan, I\u2019m happy to share that we delivered positive comp sales for the second straight quarter. Comp sales grew 0.7%, with an overall sales growth of 1.6%. While comp ticket grew at 3.0%, store traffic declined 2.3%. ","Net sales for the year grew 0.3%; however, comp sales were negative 0.5%. Despite investments in price, Walmart Japan increased gross margin 15 basis points, driven by increases in private brand penetration, direct imports, as well as managing fresh throws. In addition, Japan has been able to increase the price gap with the competition. ","I also want to acknowledge the effort put in by the Japan team on controlling costs, leveraging full year operating expenses by 34 basis points as a percentage of sales, despite continued increases in energy costs. The benefit from insurance proceeds related to the 2010 earthquake helped offset operating expenses. Benefiting from a relatively small base, Japan ended the year with an operating income increase of 25.2%. ","Looking forward in Japan, we are monitoring the potential impact of the new consumption tax that will take effect on April 1. We expect that the pending tax will pull forward buying activity for bigger ticket items into the first quarter. We are pleased with our continued improvement in Japan. ","In India, we completed the separation with our joint venture partner, Bharti Enterprises, on December 31, 2013, and now own 100% of the Best Price Modern Wholesale Cash & Carry operations. Cash and carry stores delivered a healthy comp of 19.7% this year, and we remain committed to the Indian market with this strong format. ","Looking ahead for the International segment as a whole, we expect global macroeconomic conditions to remain challenging, but are seeing some green shoots of economic recovery in various markets. For example, the economic outlook in the U.K. is improving, the outlook for China appears to be stable, and inflation should help a few markets. ","As a global company, we have responsibilities to the countries in which we operate. We earn trust through our commitment to compliance, social and environmental issues. Over the past year, we\u2019ve invested in compliance processes, training and building talented teams and will continue to do so. These processes are very important for us going forward. ","In addition, I\u2019m delighted to be part of a company that\u2019s donated millions to support charities and is leading on environmental sustainability. I\u2019m very proud of the work Walmart does to support our communities around the world. ","In closing, let me stress again how excited I am to be in this role and how optimistic I am about what the future holds for Walmart International. We are sharply focused on the priorities I discussed earlier. We have the talent in place and the right strategies to meet these objectives, and I look forward to updating you in the months and years to come about our progress. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the Sam\u2019s Club results. Roz?","Rosalind Brewer","Thanks, Dave. I want to begin by talking about the organizational changes we recently made. After extensive analysis, we rebalanced our field structure to better align our club resources with the current and potential sales volume of each club. While these decisions were not taken lightly, we believe these changes will allow us to be more agile, focusing on long-term growth opportunities within the club. Moreover, these changes will allow us to better develop our internal talent and improve service for our members, well positioning us for fiscal 15. ","Let\u2019s begin with the Q4 results. Similar to other retailers, the unforeseen winter weather was a significant headwind to the quarter. There were a number of bright spots, however, such as positive savings member traffic and their strong response to our new merchandise. Let me walk you through the highs and lows of Q4. ","Going into the quarter, we were solidly positioned to have a successful holiday season. Sales and club traffic accelerated at the beginning of Thanksgiving week, led primarily by our exclusive Sunday evening VIP Event, which posted a very strong high single-digit comp. ","However, traffic slowed following Thanksgiving, as severe winter weather covered geographic areas where we are highly penetrated, particularly the Midwest and the Plains regions. This caused a rather pronounced sales lull prior to Christmas, disrupting critical holiday shopping weekends and cancelling many holiday functions. ","This impact was further compounded by a shortened selling season, which limited our opportunity to recover sales, particularly in our food and beverage categories. While this boosted our online performance, we were disappointed to see that sales did not materialize as expected. ","Our comp for the 14-week period ending Jan. 31, 2014, excluding fuel, declined 0.1%, comprised of a traffic increase of 1.2% and a ticket decline of 1.3%. ","On a positive note, our new merchandise is resonating well with our savings member segment, or those shopping for their personal needs. However, the continued shortfalls in our business member segment, driven primarily by convenience store consolidation and a declining tobacco business, pressured our results. Business member traffic and ticket were both negative this quarter.","If you\u2019re familiar with our business, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that our business member base has been declining. Many of the small businesses we serve make a big difference to the economic environment that we all share. According to Gallup, micro-businesses \u2013 those with five or fewer employees \u2013 make up about 80% of all companies in the U.S. Clearly, the efforts of these businesses matter to the health of the economy, and they especially matter to us at Sam\u2019s Club. ","To serve our business members, we\u2019ll be rolling out new member services this coming year, initially geared at supporting the needs of our micro-business members and strengthening renewal rates. You\u2019ll hear more about these services in the coming year. ","Now, on to the financials \u2026 As Claire previously mentioned, there are two discrete items affecting comparability of our reported financials that represent an unfavorable net impact. During the quarter, we recorded operating expense charges of approximately $59 million related to the implementation of a new in-club staffing structure and the closure of one club. ","Net sales, including fuel, were $14.7 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Fuel prices decreased 2.6% compared to last year, and gallons sold were up 4.5%, contributing 10 basis points to overall sales. Sam\u2019s gross profit rate decreased 18 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 82 basis points. Operating income decreased 15.3% to $425 million. Inventory, including fuel, was up 3.2%, largely a result of new club openings. ","Volatility in fuel prices can influence our financial results. Therefore, the remainder of our discussion is focused on our core business, excluding fuel, for comparative purposes. ","Net sales for the quarter were $13.2 billion, up 1.2% from last year. Retail inflation across the club was essentially flat. Cost inflation remained slightly inflationary. ","Now let\u2019s discuss the merchandising results. Over the past year, we have worked to sharpen our merchandising focus around price, bulk, quality and excitement, with very positive results. Our home and apparel categories have done exceptionally well, as our merchants brought in new, exciting merchandise that really resonated with our members. In the coming months, we will roll out even more new merchandise to additional areas across the club. ","There were three factors that affected our Q4 merchandising results \u2013 the winter weather I mentioned, the reduction in SNAP benefits and disinflation. Despite these headwinds, the majority of our merchandising categories reported positive comp sales. ","We continue to place an emphasis on fresh, driving a low single-digit positive comp within fresh, freezer and cooler. A focus on newness and quality helped boost our Thanksgiving meal performance, with fresh sides and fresh meat both delivering low single-digit positive comps for the quarter. Deflationary pressures, specifically in dairy and cooler categories, tempered our growth. ","Grocery and beverage reported an essentially flat comp. The combination of price investments and new SKUs drove unit growth in our snacks category. This growth was offset by sales declines in weather-sensitive categories, such as juice and water. ","Tobacco performance was in line with prior quarters, with a low single-digit negative comp. Our Instant Savings events are driving awareness of our merchandise offering, resulting in market share gains in categories like table top, trash bags, and food storage, as measured by The Nielsen Group for the 13-week period ending January 18, 2014. This growth was offset by declines in our pet business, resulting in a flat comp for consumables. ","We are optimistic about the growth opportunities in health and wellness. For the quarter, health and wellness delivered a low single-digit positive comp. Member response to our pharmacist-administered immunizations drove traffic and pharmacy script counts grew. Over-the-counter sales decelerated from the prior quarter, as we lap strong prior year performance in key diet and nutrition items. ","Home, apparel and hardlines delivered a mid-single-digit comp. The merchants have really transformed this area, bringing in new items and driving excitement. In December alone, we transitioned the clubs three times, focusing on apparel at the beginning of the month, giftable items prior to Christmas, and then a home gallery vignette set on December 26, that performed exceptionally well. ","Within technology and entertainment, our VIP event and cyber week delivered solid growth. Samsclub.com is becoming even more important, with member usage increasing. During non-peak times, however, sales were soft, especially in highly competitive categories like TVs, portable electronics, and wireless. ","This ultimately led to a mid-single-digit negative comp. Technology and entertainment has been challenged over the past year, experiencing deflationary pressures and ever-changing member preferences. The team is actively working to reenergize our assortment, predominantly in mobile, driving sales with new and exciting technology. ","As our eCommerce business continues to strengthen, Black Friday and Cyber Week offers led to another quarter of double-digit sales growth. E-commerce sales contributed approximately 40 basis points for the 14- week comp period ending January 31, 2014. Year-long site improvements have strengthened conversion, particularly in mobile transactions. ","To continue supporting this growth, we\u2019ve named Jamie Iannone CEO of samsclub.com, fully integrating the Sam\u2019s Club eCommerce team with the Walmart Global eCommerce team. The integration allows us to build on our collective strengths and improve the member experience. ","Now let\u2019s continue with the reported financials \u2026 Gross profit rate decreased 21 basis points. The gross profit rate was unfavorably impacted by an adjustment to our product warranty liabilities of $39 million, or 30 basis points. Excluding this adjustment, our gross profit rate increased 9 basis points due to the merchandise mix. Our merchants continue to invest in price leadership and have managed our gross profit rate well in a very competitive pricing environment. ","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were up 91 basis points, due to changes in our staffing structure and sales challenges. The charge related to our new staffing structure and the closure of one club negatively impacted operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 45 basis points. Excluding this, operating expenses as a percentage of sales would have increased by 46 basis points. Expense reduction, improved productivity, and innovation are even greater priorities for us in this fiscal year. ","Now, I\u2019d like to call out membership income, which grew 9.0%, making Q4 our strongest quarter of the year. Back in May, we took our first fee increase since 2006 and coincidently launched Instant Savings for all. Response to Instant Savings has been incredibly well received, providing a disciplined opportunity to demonstrate price leadership. Our members have welcomed Instant Savings, both in-club and online, and it will continue to be one of several ways we communicate value. ","Investments such as Instant Savings and our new merchandise have strengthened our membership offering, growing our new sign-ups and improving our Plus level membership renewals and upgrades. While part of our growth is attributable to new clubs, we\u2019ve also utilized innovative ways to reach new prospects, such as leveraging social media campaigns. In November, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth through compelling online offerings. This drove over 160,000 redemptions and helped grow our member base. ","In other income, sales charged to the Sam\u2019s Club credit card reached record highs, resulting in a financial benefit from a profit sharing arrangement with our credit card provider. Additionally, we realized gains of $24 million for the sale of two real estate properties, increasing other income as a percentage of sales by 18 basis points. These factors contributed to our membership and other income growth of 23.4%. ","Our fourth quarter operating income was $412 million, a 15.7% decline from last year. Excluding the charges for the new club structure, the closure of one club, product warranties and the real estate gains, which net to $74 million, operating income declined 0.6%. Let\u2019s turn to the results for the year. Our annual performance was solid, especially for the first half of the year. ","With fuel, net sales were $57.2 billion, up 1.3% over last year. Our gross profit rate was flat. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income increased 0.8% to $2.0 billion. Net sales, excluding fuel, were $50.6 billion, up 1.6%. For the 53-week period ending January 31, 2014, comp sales increased 0.7%. Comp traffic was up 2% and ticket was down 1.3%. ","Membership income increased 5.9%. This has been our strongest year of membership income growth in many years, driven by new member signups and the fee increase taken last May. ","Gross profit rate was essentially flat. Operating expenses grew 3.8%. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 26 basis points. Operating income was $1.9 billion, a 1.9% increase over last year, growing slightly faster than sales. ","The charges we took in Q4, along with the real estate gain, impacted our gross profit rate by 8 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales by 12 basis points, and operating income by 3.9%. Excluding these items, gross profit rate increased 7 basis points, operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 14 basis points, and operating income grew 5.8%. That concludes our fiscal 14 discussion. ","Fiscal 15 is now under way, and we are confident that we have the right strategy and the right structure in place to execute our growth plans. The investments we made in fiscal 14, such as transforming our merchandise offering, raising our base fee, rebalancing our field structure and accelerating real estate openings positions us well to boost our top-line performance. To accomplish this, we have three key areas of focus.","First, we will continue to elevate our merchandise offering, building upon the success of home and apparel this past year. Our strategy of merchandise differentiation has resonated extremely well with our savings members, and we are excited to continue this transformation. When you visit our clubs this year, you should expect to see a strong merchandise assortment and unrelenting price leadership. ","Second, we\u2019re committed to growing at the intersection of \u201cbricks and clicks,\u201d delivering anytime, anywhere access for our members. This includes two key areas of investment to propel our growth \u2013 samsclub.com and member personalization. We\u2019re going to utilize Big Data to serve our members better, and we\u2019re going to invest not only in samsclub.com, but the connection between our online presence and our clubs. ","Finally, the importance of delivering member value has never been greater, as we strive to become an even more valued membership organization. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities, and plan to open between 17 and 22 new, relocated, and expanded units this year. Most of our capital commitment goes to new clubs. We will, however, continue to maintain and improve our fleet by remodeling between 55 and 60 units this year. ","Continued severe winter storms have resulted in a soft start to the quarter. Because of this, we expect comp sales, without fuel, for the 13- week period from February 1 to May 2, to be relatively flat. For the 13- week period last year, comp sales, excluding fuel, increased 0.2%. ","We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities at Sam\u2019s Club. The underlying health of the business is sound. The restructuring efforts implemented are allowing us to be more agile, focusing on the growth opportunities within the club channel. The strategies we have in place will deliver value to our members, helping to grow the business and drive strong financial performance in fiscal 15. Now, I\u2019ll pass things over to Charles. Charles?","Charles Holley ","","Thanks, Roz. Let me wrap up today\u2019s discussion by providing some thoughts on the company\u2019s performance last year. On the positive, we delivered over $473 billion in net sales. E-commerce sales grew over 30% to more than $10 billion, including acquisitions. ","Walmart U.S. continued their excellent trend of leveraging expenses. International made progress on reducing inventory. Sam\u2019s Club had solid growth in membership income. And, despite tough, sluggish economies, we grew underlying operating income over last year. ","Now, we did have some challenges. Currency negatively impacted consolidated net sales by over $5 billion. Our U.S. businesses faced several headwinds this past year, including the reversal of the two% payroll tax cut, the overhang of sequestration, a reduction in government food benefits, and severe weather in the fourth quarter affected sales more than we had anticipated. All of these negatively affected comp sales. ","Sluggish sales, our stepped up investment in Global eCommerce, as well as ongoing investments in our leverage and compliance organizations, made it difficult to leverage operating expenses as a company. We also did not anticipate the 26 cents of discrete items in the fourth quarter. ","Now, let me frame the remainder of my comments today around the areas where we need to focus. Our financial priorities of growth, leverage and returns continue to guide us. I\u2019ll begin with growth. ","As Doug said, Walmart needs to be more nimble and responsive to stay ahead in the fast-changing retail industry. We\u2019re very focused on driving better customer traffic and growing comp sales. You should expect that we will continue to invest in price and improving service. We will also continue to invest in growing our store base. ","Small formats represent a great growth opportunity for us in many of our markets, including the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. You heard earlier from Bill about the opportunity for us to accelerate the rollout of Neighborhood Markets and Walmart Express, given their strong comp sales performance. ","Customers appreciate the convenience and assortment these two formats offer, and today, we\u2019re expanding our capital allocation plan to increase the Walmart U.S. budget by approximately $600 million to accomplish this goal. It\u2019s an aggressive plan, considering that we are doing this in addition to our original forecast of large and small formats. ","Walmart International will continue to grow, with new store square footage predominantly across some of our key markets, including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and China. And, Sam\u2019s Club will also open between 17 and 22 clubs in the U.S. this year, building on the 12 clubs opened in fiscal 2014. ","Our company will continue to invest in and grow through ecommerce. We\u2019ve already made significant progress through site enhancements, search capabilities and fulfillment. We would expect this improvement to continue. We\u2019ll also continue to make strategic acquisitions to build out our technology, talent and capabilities, and we will increase our investment when the right opportunity or acquisition presents itself. The acquisition of Yihaodian, for example, has helped us build a strong e-commerce base in China. ","We expect to grow Global eCommerce sales to over $13 billion this fiscal year, with continued focus on the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. Our websites in Canada and Mexico are starting to gain even more customer traffic. We continue to step up investments in Pangaea, our global technology platform, which helped drive sales across our retail websites in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. ","This growth is enabled by investments we\u2019re also making in fulfillment and replenishment. Our online websites had their most successful year in fiscal 2014, and we continue to offer a great omnichannel experience for our customers. We launched a new fulfillment center in Texas in September, and it exceeded expectations during the busy holiday season. We\u2019re also launching two new fulfillment facilities in Pennsylvania and Brazil in the coming weeks. ","Now, let\u2019s turn to leverage. The productivity loop is the basis on which we deliver on our promise of everyday low cost and every day low price. We\u2019re committed to operating expense leverage across our businesses. We will continue to focus on being best-in-class operators, which will allow us to invest heavily in price and deliver stronger top-line results. ","We made significant price investments during the fourth quarter in Walmart U.S., along with all of our markets, and in this fiscal year, you should expect to see even greater investment in price leadership \u2013 whether you\u2019re a customer in London or Louisville. ","We continue to receive great support from the Walmart leverage organization, and this is an area where we will continue to invest. The teams are helping us build better sourcing capabilities, implement best practices across the organization, and improve back office efficiencies. We are strengthening our ability to leverage Big Data and analytics to help us better understand buying patterns so we can put the right product on the shelf for the right time. This allows us to better anticipate and serve the needs of our customers. ","Let\u2019s move on to returns. Return on investment for the 12 months ended January 31, 2014 was 17.0%, down from the 18.1% we reported at this time last year. Remember that our reported results included the discrete items we\u2019ve already mentioned. If you exclude these items that accounted for 40 basis points, return on investment would have been about 17.4% when compared to the prior period. As Claire has already covered, return on investment was impacted by the decrease in operating income, investments in fixed assets, and acquisitions. ","Improved operating results and better management of working capital, including inventory, will drive stronger cash flow. We plan to be very focused on our working capital this year to ensure we maximize our free cash flow in the future. ","Let\u2019s turn to guidance. We expect economic factors to have more negative than positive effect on our outlook. Now, you\u2019ve heard today about some of the factors affecting the U.S. business, including reductions in government benefits, and along with higher taxes and tight credit, these items will continue to weigh on our customers. ","In October, we forecasted a 3 to 5% net sales increase for this new fiscal year. Additionally, all guidance provided today assumes currency exchange rates remain at current levels. Now, if the currency rates remain where they are today, this would cause a negative impact to net sales of approximately $3.5 billion for fiscal 2015, when compared to actual exchange rates in 2014. Because of this, and the economic factors just mentioned, we expect to be toward the low end of that net sales guidance. ","During the first quarter of this year, we will begin to anniversary the increased costs we\u2019ve incurred for FCPA matters, including compliance program enhancements and the ongoing investigations. These costs will remain in the Corporate and Support area, and we anticipate expenses to be between $200 million and $240 million for the year. As you heard from Bill, we expect to incur more expense than originally anticipated from higher health care benefit utilization by our U.S. associates, and this will impact fiscal 2015 earnings by approximately $330 million. ","In addition, the increased investment in Global eCommerce will be between 2 and 4 cents per share over the 11 cents we invested in fiscal 2014. As of today, we would expect currency to have a negative impact on operating income of approximately $125 million for the year. ","When you take all these headwinds into account, and we adjust for the lower government benefits impacting U.S. sales, we still expect to grow operating income, although it may not grow at the same or faster rate than sales. ","With all this in mind, we expect first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.10 and $1.20. This compares to $1.14 last year. We expect full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.10 and $5.45. This compares to a reported earnings per share of $4.85 in fiscal 2014, which included the discrete items we told you about. Underlying earnings per share for fiscal 2014 were $5.11. ","Our EPS guidance is based on our forecast of the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate to range between 32 and 34%. Our tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items, and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations. ","As a reminder, the pending sale of the Vips restaurant business in Mexico remains subject to regulatory approval and is now expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Vips results are recorded in discontinued operations and the estimated future gain from the sale is expected to be approximately $0.06 per share. ","Now, let me take a minute to provide an update on our capital plans for this year. You\u2019re familiar with how we prioritize our cash and the first priority is organic growth. Accelerating the U.S. small format growth will require additional investments over what we announced in October. ","So, first, we said total company capital expenditures were projected to range between $11.8 and $12.8 billion for the year. Today, we are updating this range to $12.4 to $13.4 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million for Walmart U.S.","Next, we said the company would add between 33 and 37 million square feet of retail space for the year, including approximately 19 to 21 million square feet in Walmart U.S. We are now updating this range to 35 to 39 million square feet, including approximately 21 to 23 million square feet in Walmart U.S. Projected capital expenditures and square footage exclude the impact of future acquisitions. And, Bill covered the details on the change in unit counts for Walmart U.S. ","Our second priority for capital deployment is for strategic acquisitions. We always evaluate available acquisition opportunities that will either add to our retail platform or support our operations. As Dave discussed, we completed the transaction in Chile and now own approximately 99% of the shares of Walmart Chile. ","During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we paid approximately $1.5 billion to complete this transaction. Additionally, continued investment in e-commerce is critical to the future of our business, and we will be opportunistic in the e-commerce space as we evaluate potential acquisitions. ","After growth organically or by acquisition, our remaining cash flows provide shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We announced today that our dividend will be $1.92 per share for fiscal 2015, to be paid out quarterly. We\u2019ve now increased our dividend each year for 41 years. ","As of January 31, 2014, the company had approximately $11.3 billion remaining under our current $15 billion share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic at times with share repurchases. Market conditions, general business trends and a focus on maintaining our AA credit rating, among other factors, influence our share repurchase activity. ","We\u2019ve provided a lot of information on today\u2019s call, and hopefully it helps in understanding where we are headed for this fiscal year. We are extremely focused on improving comp sales across the organization. Our investments in new stores and e-commerce will strengthen our market share position and allow us to better serve our customers. We will continue to drive expenses out of the operations and enhance productivity. And, as always, we will continue on delivering good returns for our shareholders. ","Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Have a great day! ","Unidentified Speaker","This call included certain forward-looking statements.

This is Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The date of this call is August 17, 2017. On today's call you will hear from Doug McMillon, President and CEO as well as Brett Biggs, CFO.","This call contains statements that Walmart believes are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking information provided by that Act. A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is at the end of this call.","As a reminder, our earnings materials include the press release, transcript and accompanying slide presentation which are intended to be used together. All of this information, along with our fiscal 2018 earnings release dates, store counts, square footage, earnings infographic and other materials are available on the investors\u2019 portion of our corporate website stock.walmart.com. For our U.S. comp sales reporting in fiscal 2018, we utilize a 52-week calendar. Our Q2 reporting period ran from Saturday, April 29, 2017 through Friday, July 28, 2017.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you of a few upcoming dates. Our annual Investment Community Meeting will be held in Northwest Arkansas on October 9 and 10. Registration will begin next week. Also, we will release [second] quarter earnings on Thursday, November 16.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon.","Douglas McMillon","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid with continued topline momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%.","The U.S. store team has done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we\u2019re making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money and that\u2019s exciting to see.","In addition, Sam\u2019s Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we\u2019re making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.","Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I\u2019m encouraged by innovation in the business. We\u2019re testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.","With Easy Reorder on walmart.com, a customer has visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they\u2019ve bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list.","Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than a million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket.","Then, they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It\u2019s a huge time-saver for busy families. If you haven\u2019t done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out. We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we\u2019re using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing.","Sam\u2019s Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan & Go and we\u2019ll be further expanding Scan & Go within Walmart U.S. this year. This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville to pitch their Made in the USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our Investing in American Jobs Open Call in June.","And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them.","In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment, and have provided critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.","A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they\u2019re working on.","We believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing the seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them.","We\u2019ve seen strong results from the rollout of online grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we\u2019re expanding this service in many of our markets around the world. Retail is constantly evolving and it\u2019s critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change.","Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It\u2019s exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both.","Under Greg Foran\u2019s leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years. We\u2019re also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We\u2019ve done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels.","Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks and we\u2019re becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We\u2019ve now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.","In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust topline growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience.","They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart\u2019s free two-day shipping on millions of items. And we\u2019re seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up non-store items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers\u2019 desire.","Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam\u2019s Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 23%.","Overall, we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow and I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We\u2019re also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member\u2019s Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.","Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with nine of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.","Walmex continues to be the strongest International market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What\u2019s even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.","In China, our stores are improving and we launched Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than one hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.","Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we\u2019ve made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories.","We\u2019re also encouraged that the UK delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pick-up and delivery from stores, but also from fulfillment centers in higher-volume environments.","So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.","In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with the solid first half results. We are uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re equipping our associates to deliver it. I\u2019d like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It\u2019s making a difference. We have a clear strategy that we\u2019re executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.","Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett.","Brett Biggs","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We are improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online.","We are guided by our financial framework to deliver strong, efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We are making progress on each element, and it\u2019s through this lens that I\u2019ll discuss our results.","Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 was at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.","Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05.","It\u2019s also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the Company\u2019s EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China. Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year.","Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.","We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leveraged expenses in our U.S. stores, as well as in the International segment. As a Company, SG&A delevered by 10 basis points in the period, primarily due to increased technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam\u2019s Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we are going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m encouraged by the focus I\u2019m seeing.","Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first six months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. We are still seeing improvement in working capital, but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.","In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally, and in the U.S. we further expanded our online grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.","Let\u2019s now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.","Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the topline as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. We are delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free two-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder, as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.","With Easy Reorder, we\u2019re integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we\u2019ll begin to lap the jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.","Now, let\u2019s move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a two-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic.","The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments. All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment.","Keep in mind the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer\u2019s home, but also omni-channel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pickup Today. Gross margin rate declined five basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business, as well as continued investments in price.","Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remained high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology.","Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase. Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.","We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we\u2019re providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.","Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continued to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.","The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.","Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few items from international affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency.","Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period, even as we made important investments.","Let\u2019s now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.","Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.","In Canada, net sales increased 3.4%, and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.","Turning to the UK, net sales increased 3.9%, and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.","In China, net sales increased 2.5%, and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw a negative impact to topline results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in the fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.","From an e-commerce perspective, we continued to expand our offering through the alliance with JD.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than one hour.","Moving on to Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We\u2019re serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% or Club Pickup.","Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close four underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win.","We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We\u2019re laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.","With that, let\u2019s talk about guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full-year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full-year.","The initial guidance for full-year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full-year effective tax rate around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.","Overall, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we\u2019re heading as a Company and how we\u2019re improving our customer\u2019s lives.","As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day. You serve an incredible number of customers each day, and you do it well.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Q - "," ","Operator","This call includes certain forward-looking statements intended to enjoy the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
