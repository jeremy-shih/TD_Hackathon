Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning, and they are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the Marsh & McLennan Companies' website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.","I will now turn this call over to the Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results as reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman.","I'm also very pleased to welcome Keith Walsh, our new Head of Investor Relations. Keith joined us in December following many years of covering the insurance industry as an analyst at Citi. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","I feel truly honored to be leading this call, my first as President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. My principal role as CEO of MMC will be to build on our success, finding new ways to grow, invest, innovate and realize the full potential of our businesses. As many of you know, I was previously Group President and COO of MMC for over 1.5 years and CEO of Marsh for more than 3 years prior to that. During my time as Group President, I also briefly acted as the CEO of Mercer before Julio joined the executive team. It was an invaluable experience for me to have run both Marsh and Mercer.","Along with the rest of the executive team, I was actively involved in developing our 4 pillar strategy, first articulated in 2010: growth in revenue and earnings per share, low capital requirements, high cash generation and managing the risk profile of the company. The best thing about our 4 pillar strategy is that we are executing it well. We have successfully generated both revenue and profitability growth over the last 3 years. Further, we have maintained low capital requirements and generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a high degree of flexibility to innovate and expand, particularly in growth markets. It also allows us to return capital to shareholders via a strong dividend and a meaningful share repurchase program.","The broad 4 pillars strategic framework will continue to serve us well. Our goal remains to produce at least 10% organic growth in operating income over the long term. Effective capital management, including disciplined deployment of excess cash into acquisitions and share repurchase, should contribute to EPS growth approaching 13% and with our dividend, shareholder returns around 16%.","Moving onto our financials. I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results, which reflected our ongoing strong performance over the course of 2012. Reflecting on our performance for the year, we delivered underlying revenue growth of 4%, with growth in each operating company for the third consecutive year. Underlying expense growth was less than 3%, which produced 12% growth in adjusted operating income. And our overall margin increased 120 basis points to 15.6%, an excellent performance.","Risk and Insurance Services produced another outstanding year. Underlying revenue growth was 5%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing.  Adjusted operating income rose 12% with margin expansion to 20.5%, an increase of 130 basis points. This is the segment's highest annual margin since 2003. To put this into perspective, over the last 5 years, we have more than doubled the Risk and Insurance Services adjusted margin from less than 9% to over 20% despite lower fiduciary income, higher pension expense, significant investments in the business and a challenging economic and pricing environment. This speaks to the strength of our core earnings and underlines the operating leverage we have built into the business.","Marsh's underlying revenue rose 5% in 2012 with all geographies contributing. Latin America was up 13%; Asia Pacific increased 7%; EMEA grew 5%; and the U.S.\/Canada region increased 3%. Marsh continued to generate strong levels of new business with $1.1 billion for the year, a new annual record.","Guy Carpenter produced 6% underlying revenue growth for the year. This marks 16 consecutive quarters Carpenter has delivered underlying revenue growth. Growth was driven by Carpenter's international operations, particularly global specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA, Latin America and global facultative.","The Consulting segment also delivered solid underlying revenue growth in 2012, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributing to the 4% increase. And we have made substantial progress in the execution of our strategy to increase profitability.  Adjusted operating income increased 14% and the adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 13.2%, Consulting's highest annual margin since 2004.","Mercer had a strong year, which represents an excellent start on their path to growing profitability and increasing margins. Underlying revenue grew 4%, reflecting higher revenue across all regions. And every line of business contributed to this growth: as Investments grew 8%; Health & Benefits increased 7%; Outsourcing rose 4%; and both Talent and Retirement grew 1%.","Since joining Mercer a year ago, Julio and his team have undertaken a comprehensive review of Mercer's operations. Today, Mercer has been reoriented around 4 core lines of business: Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2013, Mercer will no longer report Outsourcing as a standalone business. These services, which generated over $700 million in revenue last year, will remain an important part of Mercer's capabilities.","One of Mercer's objectives is to build broader client relationships.  More closely aligning administration services with Mercer's core business lines will help achieve this. We also made the decision to transfer the affinity and voluntary benefits businesses of Marsh's U.S. Consumer division to Mercer in the first quarter of 2013. We believe this business, which had $225 million of annual revenue and growth consistent with the Marsh U.S.\/Canada region, will be further enhanced as part of Mercer.","It has become clear to us that traditional and voluntary benefits are converging.  So aligning these businesses within Mercer enables us to concentrate our efforts and expertise. Another important development at Mercer is the recent launch of its U.S. health exchange, known as Mercer Marketplace. We are excited to add this new offering to an already robust set of products and solutions in Mercer's Health business.","At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue growth for the year was 3%, which we believe to be a reasonable result given the macroeconomic environment and weakness in Europe. This growth was driven by strong increases in the Health & Life Sciences and Communications practices, complemented by steady growth in Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest practice.","In closing, we are very pleased with MMC's operational and financial performance. I believe we are well positioned to deliver on our long-term goals, which should lead to superior returns for our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike to review our results in more detail.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $300 (sic) [$3] billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 10% to $450 million and the consolidated margin increased 90 basis points to 15%.","GAAP EPS was $0.47. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $0.52 from $0.46 in last year's fourth quarter. Revenue at Risk and Insurance Services was $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 3% at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. By holding adjusted underlying expense growth to 1%, adjusted operating income rose 8% to $312 million. Margins expanded by 80 basis points, reaching 19.2% in the quarter.","At Marsh, underlying revenue growth was led by a 5% increase in the International division. This included 13% growth in Latin America and 3% for both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Overall, Marsh's revenue growth was driven by record new business production of approximately $300 million. Guy Carpenter continued its long-term trend of solid financial performance and underlying revenue growth. Its 3% growth was led by Canada, U.S. facultative, Latin America, the U.K. and certain global specialties.","Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.4 billion, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income rose 8% to $179 million and the margin expanded 70 basis points to 13%.","At Mercer, underlying revenue growth was 6%, its strongest quarter of the year. Excellent growth was achieved at Investments, Health & Benefits and Outsourcing. As you are aware, Oliver Wyman's 3% decline in underlying revenue in the quarter was anticipated due to the weak European economic environment and the timing of revenue recognition between the first and fourth quarters. As was the case for the full year, we saw strong growth in the Health & Life Sciences and Communications practices.","MMC's consolidated underlying revenue growth for the year was 4%. Adjusted operating income rose 12% to $1.9 billion and the margin grew 120 basis points to 15.6%. For the year, GAAP EPS was $2.13. Adjusted EPS increased 21% to $2.15. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt in 2011, adjusted earnings growth was 16%.","We anticipate annual corporate expense this year will be lower than 2012. Quarterly expenses should average 75 -- I'm sorry, $45 million a quarter. Investment income in the fourth quarter was $4 million. Effective yesterday, Trident II divested its remaining position in AXIS. As a result, MMC's investment income in the first quarter will approach $20 million.","Regarding our restructuring in the fourth quarter, the vast majority relates to Mercer. As Dan indicated, this results from Mercer's repositioning as it implements its new long-term strategy. 1\/3 of the $51 million expense was due to the sale of a small Canadian outsourcing business, which was announced last October. The balance of the expense included position elimination, software writeoffs and real estate rationalization. We have greatly reduced noteworthy items that are excluded from adjusted operating income. On an expense base of over $10 billion, net adjustments to GAAP for the past 2 years were only $22 million in 2011 and $35 million in 2012.","Taxes. For the year, our adjusted tax rate was 30% and we feel this is a reasonable rate to use for financial modeling purposes in 2013. Pension expense. On December 31, interest rates for longer debt maturities used to measure pension liabilities were again lower than the prior year. Based on the year-end measurement, our pension expense will increase this year by $30 million.","Moving to capital management. The largest use of our cash in the fourth quarter was $149 million for acquisitions, including 5 at Marsh & McLennan Agency. Today, MMA has annualized revenue of $450 million. Also in the quarter, we used $128 million for dividends and repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $50 million. Since instituting our share repurchase program 2 years ago, we have repurchased 22 million shares for almost $700 million. For the year, the major uses of cash included approximately $500 million for dividends, $340 million for acquisitions, $230 million for share repurchase and $200 million for discretionary pension contributions. The use of cash over the course of 2012 approaches $1.3 billion.","Additionally, last month, we made a $70 million discretionary contribution to one of our international pension plans. We are prepared to make additional contributions if there is a long-term economic rationale and it can be accomplished in a tax-efficient manner.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask why is the organic growth in the P&C brokerage segment?  It was one of the lowest in many quarters and also is now well below peers that have already reported.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So I think the best thing to do is to go to Peter and Alex on that. So I'll start with Peter.","Peter Zaffino","Sure. Greg, when you look at the variability that happens quarter-to-quarter, I would encourage us to focus on what happens in the year, as well as looking year-over-year. So when I look at U.S. and Canada in 2011, the segment grew at 3% and in 2012, it grew at 3%. When I look at the International growth in 2011, it was 6% and in 2012, it was 6%. So it's challenging to take just a look at the quarter. It's much better to look at what is the last 4 quarters and I think you can see we've had very consistent growth. International has contributed more than the U.S. and Canada. We've had terrific performance from Latin America, where they grew 13% during the year. EMEA, with all of its challenges and economic headwinds, grew 5% for the year. Asia Pac grew 7% for the year. So overall, with the challenging headwinds, we're pleased with what's happened during the year. If I can just comment for a second on what happened in the U.S. and Canada because I'm sure some curiosity as to why it's 0%. Again we look at 2012 and are pleased with the performance. There's always variability and nonrecurring items in quarters. We've mentioned that before, both positive and negative. And having said that, in the fourth quarter, U.S. and Canada did get hit with an abnormal amount of negative variability that impacted the growth in that segment. So again I would encourage us to take a look at the year, the key performance indicators for new business. As Dan mentioned, we had record new business in the year. But we also had record new business in the quarter, including in the U.S. Retention, absent the variability, was consistent with prior quarters and our overall pipeline is quite strong. So when you take a look at the quarter and the year, I'd encourage you to take a look more at the year. And as we look to 2013, we don't give guidance, but the year will reflect more of the growth than the quarter.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Yes. I mean, 3% underlying growth, actually I think it was a fairly decent quarter. There was no doubt that last year, it was a more benign year from the point of view of catastrophes. And so there were some pressures on rates. But all in all, we actually did a little bit better than we expected to be in what is our smallest quarter. So I really don't have much to add to that.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Also just one comment, Greg. I think you have to be cautious when looking at peers or your comment with regard to underperformance versus peers. We don't have many peers. And so there may be some reporting which would be more equivalent to a smaller segment within our business. But our RIS business is a $6.5 billion annual business, and we're in every geography in every segment. And so there may be -- we don't have many peers out there.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, to just -- very thorough answer. What I'm sort of taking away from it is that empirically, you guys limped into year end in the P&C brokerage segment. So that's just the way it is, and it was actually centered in the U.S.\/Canada segment as you said, which flies totally in the face of what we're seeing from the peers. But you feel very, very good given where pricing is going in the U.S, given the trends you see that this quarter is not a quarter to be extrapolated into 2013 and beyond. There's nothing in the core business that you see that you want to call out right now that we should be -- that should cause us frankly to all be lowering our organics in that segment going forward.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I think your summary is correct.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The outlook for margin expansion seems to be a bit stronger in Consulting than the Risk and Insurance Services segment. And that certainly was the case for the full year 2012. I was wondering if you could talk about that in relation to your long-term 13% EPS growth target as well.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Look, well, first, let me just hand over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, this is Mike. Just to correct, I would say the margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services was 130 basis points in 2012 and for Consulting, 140. So I would say that we saw a very significant margin improvement in both of our segments over the course of the year. I just wanted to make sure that, that was factually correct right there.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. And Jay, when we look at the businesses, of course, RIS started earlier, right, in terms of really focusing on the business disciplines and profit improvement. And we really started getting going in Consulting with the arrival of Julio and Julio's leadership team at Mercer and forming strategies around improving profitability. And so when we look at both segments where we stand today, I'm actually quite optimistic that we have the ability over the next few years to continue to expand margins in each of our segments. And I wouldn't really put an emphasis on larger margin expansion in Consulting versus RIS. I think that there's capabilities in both to do that. Of course, it remains -- it's subject to the overall environment, the GDP environment around the world, the macroeconomic environment, a little bit of the PC -- P&C pricing cycle. But ultimately, as long as we can achieve modest levels of revenue growth, we feel comfortable that we will be able to continue to expand our margins in both segments.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And with regard to the organic expense growth, Mike, I think you talked about 3% underlying. And is that something that can persist?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes. I mean, certainly, Jay, when we look at how we run the business, we have been continually investing in the business over the last several years and very much focused on creating mid- and long-term value for our shareholders. And so when we look at the expense base, we've been wearing those investments, we've been wearing some higher pension costs, et cetera. And we believe we can continue to do that.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Meyer Shields with Stifel.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dan, you talked a little bit about changing the segment reporting within Mercer. When you talk about including the affinity stuff from Marsh, is that going to have a material margin impact?","Daniel S. Glaser","No, it will not. I mean, the margins of that business are relatively consistent with the overall margins of the Consulting segment.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I infer from that, that it'll boost margins in Risk and Insurance a little bit?","Daniel S. Glaser","If you want to cut a fine line to it, yes, the math works that way. But it would be so small relative to the size of RIS that it would barely turn up.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. When you look at both segments, I'm talking about the 2013 outlook, are you budgeting for or expecting any slowdown in consumer spending because of higher payroll taxes?","Daniel S. Glaser","When we look at our business from a budgeting perspective, we tend to look at where the business has been performing over the course of like a rolling 4 quarters basis and what the macro environment looks like on a rolling 4 quarters. So we don't put any real optimism into our numbers based upon the fact that we feel that at least the sentiment seems to be improving a bit from where it was midyear last year. And on the other hand, we don't put many pessimistic thoughts in there, too, as to the impacts of something like a payroll tax. So ultimately, our business should perform a little bit above GDP in most jurisdictions. And so that's probably, on a broad sense, the more accurate thing to look at.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","I'm wondering if you could just talk about the underlying insurance pricing impact that you felt in 2012 for the year. And I know it's incredibly early in 2013 but perhaps look into the crystal ball and see how the impact in '13 might compare with '12.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So I think that question as well, Larry, is probably best for Peter and for Alex. So Peter, why don't we start with Marsh?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. Thanks, Larry. And let me start with the fourth quarter. We measure what's called a Marsh Risk Management Global Insurance Index, and that rose 1.2% on a global basis. If you think about how our portfolio splits in the quarter, it's about 49% U.S., 51% International. If I look back on the first, second quarter, in the U.S., we started to see a lot more probably modest increases in property, started to see more momentum in some of the more stressed casualty lines. And I would say that's continued in the third and fourth quarter, although modest increase when you compare quarter-to-quarter. The International business, again, a lot harder to just give a statement because they're in different geographies, there's different lines of business, but generally speaking, that's been fairly flat. Some lines of business have increased.  I would think more around peak zone properties, so if you go into Asia, if you go into Pacific, parts of Latin America and then other segments' lines of business have been coming off. So on average, I would think for the year that the International has been flat. And again with the U.S., we've had a little bit of an impact on Sandy, not much. And that started to fall off a little bit in the fourth quarter.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Yes. On the reinsurance side, really as I said before, the year was benign from the point of view of catastrophes compared certainly to a year prior. And we saw some general softening. Sandy probably strengthened the resolve of some underwriters to try and keep some pricing. And if you had a portfolio that was affected by Sandy, I believe there were some price increases. But we didn't see any tailwind from rating so far in the renewals for 2013.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Great. And then just one housecleaning. Mike, with Trident's sale of AXIS, is that going to effectively eliminate investment income post the first quarter?","J. Michael Bischoff","Larry, that's a very good question. We do have investments in a number of other private equity firms. But the issue really that has caused running through our P&L is the accounting treatment for private equity firms when they hold a public company. And essentially, that was AXIS that Trident II held. And so when they marked it to market for each quarter, we would have to realize that through our P&L in the subsequent quarter. And so with Trident II essentially being closed down, it essentially then means that we would really not have, after the first quarter, much running through our investment income line.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to expand, if I could, a little on the kind of pricing and market conditions commentary. Where are you seeing the impact of firming market conditions in the U.S. impacting your results, whether on a revenue or margin basis? And then just one follow-up.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Peter?","Peter Zaffino","The pricing, if you translate it to our results, again, we saw some changes in the market based on Sandy in the fourth quarter. And I really put them into 3 categories. One is pricing. So if you had Northeast exposure, loss-affected or flood-exposed, you started to see pricing. There has been as much focus on coverage. I mean, we saw a lot about storm surges.  Is it in the wind or is it in flood?  Deductibles increasing.  And then looking at capacity and how that's going to be impacted in the future. The U.S., our business has been moving more to commission, but we still have a split of a fee and commission, and then we also have a business that's well populated with high deductibles, or SIRs, which will be less affected than a guaranteed cost and what you perhaps are seeing in the market for what's happening with pricing. So overall, I think the pricing had a modest impact and in line with what we said for the global index, which was in the 1% to 2% range.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So does the fact that you're securing better rate for your customers than the market overall, how -- does that manifest in retention? Does that -- like other than just pure margin, how do you see firming market conditions in the U.S. impacting your business overall?","Peter Zaffino","The firming conditions, I think, will have a couple of impacts. One would be, as you mentioned, on the retention. So we will tend to retain more clients based on the service capabilities, our ability to execute on claims. And I also believe that there's a flight to quality when there's a challenge in placing business. And we have tremendous expertise in our infrastructure for line of business, for industries' segments. And we're well represented across the U.S. in terms of how we trade with markets. And so our clients tend to want to stay and we have prospects that tend to want to come. So I would expect to see that new business trend to be strong, retentions to be strong and for us to be able to grow as a result of it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just, Dan, if I could, just on deployment. About $1.3 billion-ish to spend, if our math is right, maybe half of that dividends and pension. First question is, is that still the right way to think about that? And second is how do you think about the other half? I mean, are you biased towards building out MMA, the agency platform? Or do you see more value on the buyback side?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, okay. So I do think that our dividend is pretty sacrosanct over the last 50 years, and that's going to be a call on our free cash each year. Pension, as Mike was saying in his script, will vary in terms of discretionary contributions to pension based upon the economic rationale and the tax efficiency of doing those sorts of things. And that may vary over time. In terms of the balance between acquisitions and share repurchase, I would say we are always focused on creating value for shareholders. And so therefore, we are looking at, in making acquisitions, what adds to the strength of Marsh & McLennan Companies, what creates additional value that we would be able to then achieve over the mid- and long-term. And our own thought process is that as long as we acquire well, we should be able to build more value through acquisitions than any other means. Having said that, acquisitions, even when you have a reasonable pipeline, you can't predict year-by-year of how much you're going to spend with acquisitions. And so therefore, share repurchase remains a very viable and appropriate way for us to utilize excess cash. Buying back around $700 million over the last 2 years has been pretty consistent and a significant sum. We have a share repurchase authorization up to $1 billion. Clearly, authorizations are board decisions, but we would expect that our board would consider that sort of thing in the future. And certainly, we think that share repurchase would be a good use of excess cash when we don't have acquisitions to make.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So acquisitions first, then buybacks?","Daniel S. Glaser","Correct. I wouldn't say acquisitions. I would say good acquisitions, accretive acquisitions.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. The first, in Mercer, with the change in the presentation where you're, I guess, getting rid of Outsourcing, I assume that will just be merged into the other businesses.","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes. Thank you, Jay. Yes, I want to make it clear that I certainly wouldn't qualify our change as getting rid of Outsourcing. We are very much committed to keeping our Outsourcing business alive and well and a viable option for our clients. We know that there are administrative supports that are necessary in order for us to be able to drive the high-margin business and value proposition to our clients for core offerings like Retirement, core offerings like H&B or Health & Benefits, and of course, Investments. And so with that, we will have the Outsourcing that supports those businesses be part of the P&L in those businesses and also part of the overall strategy to expand and broaden our client relationships. So Outsourcing will exist inside the lines of businesses that it supports.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And when I said get rid of it, I just meant from a financial reporting standpoint. But thanks for that for mentioning that. And Julio, while you're on the phone there, can you talk about the exchange that you launched and what your outlook is? And when do you think it could actually help from an earnings standpoint?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks again, Jay. As many are aware, just a few weeks ago, we announced the launch of Mercer Marketplace, which is our active exchange for the U.S. market. And we're really excited about the new offering. Mercer Marketplace is a private, active benefit exchange designed to help employers and their employees more effectively manage their benefit costs while providing employees and their dependents with superior choice, flexibility and service. So the employees of our clients will have access to a broad array of traditional as well as voluntary benefits from multiple insurance providers.  And along with education tools, which is very important, to support and help employees customize their choices and to better fit their needs and make informed decisions. Our exchange can be scaled for employees with -- or employers with very few employees, as well as the largest of employers with thousands of employees. It goes live for enrollment for the 2014 enrollment period, which means we'll be up and going by the end of the year during the enrollment time. So we're in discussions with several of our clients, as you can imagine, there's been varying degrees of interest as we move forward. I really want to focus on the fact that the whole exchange arena continues to be a developing type of market for us and various others. And I think what's important now is to ensure that we have some sort of distinction in the way we are offering our exchange versus others. So Mercer's Marketplace, as I said, is going to be very scalable. It will offer a complete set of solutions and products across a full scale, ranging from medical, life, disability, et cetera, et cetera. The platform accommodates both insured and self-insured plans. I want to make that clear, it accommodates both insured and self-insured plans. And we'll offer a lot of plan designs and support a broad defined contribution strategy for our health and welfare benefit. So as you can see, it's going to be quite a launch for us as we move forward with it. There will be some really good competitive advantage, and we'll continue to actually calibrate our investments for the Mercer Marketplace as we validate proof of concepts and testing that we'll be doing along the way to ensure that it really appeals to our target audience.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Maybe just wanted to touch a little bit more on sort of the restructuring in the quarter and the reorientation within Mercer. And I know kind of one of the beneficial points in the past is your ability to absorb some of the restructuring costs. I'm just curious -- and I know, Mike, you gave some numbers around the adjustments to operating income. But restructuring costs are up year-over-year. So I'm just curious are you guys planning to change sort of your ability to absorb restructuring costs? Kind of how should we think about potential restructuring? Or is sort of the operating platform such a way that you guys would like at this point?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, Ray. So it's Dan here. There's no change in our philosophy with regard to restructuring and there is no thought in our minds that our ability to absorb normal course types of changes to the business and structures is any different than it has been over the last couple of years. So I would look at this more along the lines of Julio and his team doing a kind of drains up review, comprehensive review of their business. And usually, a new CEO gets about one crack at that. So well done, Julio, and we move on from here.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","That's helpful. And just, I guess, following up on cash on the balance sheet. Just curious, do you know how much cash you guys hold onshore versus offshore at year end and maybe talk about how to get that cash offshore back into the U.S.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Sure, Dan, I'd be happy to. Well, actually we were very effective in bringing our cash onshore. At the end of the year, we have $933 million of cash in the U.S. out of the $2.3 billion.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then last quick, if I can squeeze it in. In terms of debt, you guys have a maturity coming, I guess, this month. How should we think about debt, given your debt to capital is around 30% and debt to EBITDA is around 1.3x?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan. You're absolutely right. We have a $250 million debt maturity this month. Let me first say that we have no plans to actively delever our balance sheet beyond where we are today. We think with the growth in the earnings that we'll see -- not just the last few years but we'll see in the coming years, we'll effectively continue to delever the balance sheet and improve our credit metrics, which are important to us. That said and the fact that we were very successful in bringing back quite a bit of cash into the U.S. for a variety of uses, the timing of when we essentially will fund that debt maturity over the course of the year, I think, is still open. So we'll be very attentive to when we go back into the debt markets. So it will be done this year, but the timing of it is yet to be determined.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Coming back to a little bit on Greg's question earlier in the call. Can you subdivide a little bit the growth rates for middle markets, upper middle markets and large case business, so we can like sort of try and then pace out what 2013 is going to look like?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. No, we're not going to segment our business on growth rates because we feel if we did that, we would then do it every quarter and it would create a lot of management time to create the information and vet it properly for external reporting. Let me just say this. The small commercial business in the Marsh & McLennan Agency is probably the area that is most appropriately matched against the peer group that some of you have been thinking about. And in our view, the core brokerage business within Marsh & McLennan Agency is performing at our expectations and is consistent overall with what we would expect looking at their peer group.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And which is a smaller peer group, obviously.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, that would be a smaller peer group.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so in thinking about in terms of the opportunity going forward, when you were looking at the pricing, I mean, we've seen that there's obviously the tailwind coming from the middle market segment. What do you think is the -- this time next year, what will we be seeing for the large case business in terms of sort of the tailwind? Do you think it will catch up to the smaller middle market business in terms of pricing?","Daniel S. Glaser","There's a couple of ways to approach that question, Joshua. I think on an overall sense, in Peter's commentary or answer to the previous -- one of the previous questions, he was saying you should really look at the year of both top line for Marsh overall but also specifically with regard to the U.S.\/Canada division. I think one interesting point, which might be a little bit different, which I'll ask Peter to expand on, is that Marsh has made significant progress over the last few years converting some of their book and growing the commissionable book in some of their offerings. So Peter, you want to expand on that?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. We have new business each year that represents around 15% to 20% of our revenue and we have been very conscientious of trying to convert the new business to as much commission versus fee. And I think in the past, we had said that we are around 50-50 fee versus commission. And now when you look at the -- in fourth quarter, the portfolio in its entirety, it's now around 40% fee, 60% commission. And that is a positive because, again, one, it is more transparent with clients, although certainly fees are transparent.  Is that it's more aligned with the market in terms of when you'd perhaps see some pricing increases, you may perhaps see less, depending on what geography, what line of business, what segment and what's happening at that point in time in those specific areas.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that make any changes in employee retention if you're higher commission rates?","Peter Zaffino","I'm sorry?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If more of the business is coming from commission rather than fees, does that change employee retention characteristics at all?","Daniel S. Glaser","When we look at revenue retention, any lift, whether it's fee lift or commission lift, would benefit revenue retention. So clearly, it doesn't do anything with account retention. But with regard to revenue retention, it would. But we try to get higher fees as well when we talk year-over-year with our clients. So really, any lift in fees or commissions help revenue retention.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","In Consulting, it looked like both H&B and also Outsourcing were pretty strong for the quarter. I guess, 2 questions. One, was there any project revenue that helped either of those segments? And would you say the outlook going into 2013 for both those areas is continuing strong or even getting better as we go into 2013?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","So, thanks for the question. Let me start off first by saying that we were pretty pleased with the overall results that we had at Mercer on the revenue side for the entire year and the fourth quarter as well. You can see in the H&B line, that actually has been picking up quarter-by-quarter with this fourth quarter now being our strongest. We continue to see a lot of benefit and a lot of consultancy work coming out of all the clarification that happened around the Affordable Care Act. There is significant amount of activity with both state consultancy that we're doing, as well as client consultancy that we're doing. And we continue to also see a lot of interest in understanding how to be able to control costs and bring extra choice to employees, and thus a lot of interest in discussing and evaluating different options and approaches going forward. I think that it's fair to say that the H&B business is going to continue to see that type of demand of our services and I think we're well positioned for that. And I would ask you to think about that more along the lines of what the annual growth rate was for H&B, which was somewhere around 7% as opposed to the fourth quarter growth rate. I think it's more indicative to look at full year. And as far as Outsourcing is concerned, that was benefited by some, let's say, project work, out-of-scope project work. It continues to benefit from that. Outsourcing could be a little lumpy as the year goes on because of that very nature of project work that we can -- that we get. We saw that in the fourth quarter. It will continue to be kind of lumpy. And again I would point you to the annual growth rate for Outsourcing of somewhere around 4%.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And  one follow-up on the health care exchange. Do you have or at what point will you have a, I guess full suite or adequate suite of health insurers as part of that exchange? And also how long do you think it will take you to be up to speed to handle a large national client?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, we'll be -- well, let me take the first part of the question first. As you can imagine, we're in active discussions right now with carriers. There is a lot of interest coming from them and I'm sure that soon enough we'll have an opportunity to discuss more specifically how many we'll have on as we go into the 2014 enrollment period that, of course, will take place later on in 2013. As far as going forward and where do we see it developing, I think as I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of moving parts in this, not just for ourselves but for our competitors. I think those who are going to win in this space are ones that can really understand the distinction and differentiation that'll be necessary in order to be able to have the appeal that is needed in the marketplace and in the targets that we're going to be focusing on. So stay tuned, I guess, is the best way to say how we're going to move forward. And there'll be development and we'll continue to keep you abreast of them as they continue to develop throughout the year.","Daniel S. Glaser","If I might just add to that for a second. I mean, one of the reasons, and there were many reasons of moving the U.S. Consumer business to Mercer, is Julio's, in particular, expertise and leadership roles that he has had in his career in consumer businesses. And Julio, do you want to just expand a little bit on the call center operations that we're moving over?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes. There was a question earlier that talked -- that had asked a little bit about some of the reasoning perhaps for bringing the Consumer business of Marsh over. And I think there's a lot of pretty obvious ones. One is that you see the converging of the core medical health benefits and voluntary benefits happening more and more. There's a blurring of the lines between those 2 offers. We have a very expansive way to be able to handle that on the Mercer side and it just makes sense to put it together for the U.S. in that fashion. Also, as importantly is that as we build an appropriate offering for our exchanges, is an important element, as Dan mentioned, of the Consumer business that actually incorporates licensed agency call centers that allows us to obviously fulfill then more adequately the type of demands that we're going to see through the exchange. And then since Dan mentioned it, I guess I'll mention it as well, and that is that I have had extensive consumer market experience internationally and in the U.S. over my previous lives prior to joining Mercer, and certainly look forward to be able to bring more value out of that business for our organization as we go forward into the future. So there's a lot of really good reasons for doing this. And I think it does give us some sort of strength and differentiation in the way we'll be going through exchanges, as well as other aspects I mentioned on the voluntary and core Health & Benefits.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","One quick follow-up. As you further develop the exchanges, will expenses -- will you need to ramp-up expenses in the near term to do that?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thank you, Dan. We are carefully assessing the investments that are necessary and the returns that we should get from that investment or those investments on a short-, medium- and long-term basis. We're very disciplined about that. We'll continue to calibrate that appropriately. Don't want to overinvest early, don't want to underinvest. So I think it's really one of those things that we'll continue to look at. We'll continue to make sure it's properly aligned. But the focus is and continues to be margin expansion at Mercer, okay? We've had it in this year, we expect that we are going to continue down that path going forward. And we believe that exchanges will be a part of being able to contribute to that margin expansion as time goes on.","Operator","We will go to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","A little bit of a follow-up here. Where exactly is housed this sort of critical, smallish business -- basically the 50 under lives and other type businesses at Marsh? I'm guessing it's pretty small. I know that Marsh Agency writes at least some of it, but geographically, where should we be looking for it when we get to that point where we need to see how things change?","Daniel S. Glaser","If I can understand your question properly, I'll just rephrase it and let me know if I've got it right. You're looking to where we have essentially H&B business in the 50 lives or under category.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Right. Because I think that's the business that is most likely to be changed one way or the other at the end of the year.","Daniel S. Glaser","And you're right. We would have some of that business in Marsh & McLennan Agency and some of that business in Mercer. But even if you put them together, it would not move the needle for us in either H&B or our overall revenue for Marsh or Mercer. We just don't have a lot of that business.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Is that business -- in your view, I know it's small. But maybe you'll have an opinion because I think it's a bit -- a much bigger issue for others that you'd like to voice. Is that business going to increasingly a self-insurance model? Or do you think it will just all go to the exchanges?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. I think ultimately, because we're not large in that space, we read all the same commentary that you do. I think you can be comfortable that we're not going to -- we don't have strategy to drive into that space.","Operator","Our last question today will come from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","In the risk side of things, the insurance brokerage business, I sort of tried to work with what I think of as a classic model of exposures, growth in exposures times growth in rate times underlying inflation and the values of things that are being insured times whatever your average fee or commission is. Now when I think along those lines, and I'm sure you follow this, you must think about it better than I do, the question that I come up with, if we look at just from your perspective the difference between U.S. and International with respect to the general trends in those 4 factors, is there something that emerges clearly? Because there is a clear contrast between your 3% annual growth rate in the U.S. and what underwriters were saying about the opportunities to write business that was available to them in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering if you could spell it out a little more clearly.","Daniel S. Glaser","I think for the last number of years, we have grown faster internationally than we have grown in the U.S.\/Canada division. And the underlying factor that drives that is there is more growth in the world than there has been in the developed U.S.\/Canada division. And so we have been grinding it out in U.S.\/Canada and in other -- some other parts of the developed world with good organic growth strategies. And we're pleased to be growing most often above GDP, even in the developed world. But we're -- in the RIS side, we're in 90 different countries. And so when there's more growth in the world, we're there to catch it. Now some of that growth frankly comes from the developed world into the developing world and so our client relationships in U.S.\/Canada and in Europe, to name 2 parts of the developed world, we capture in places like Latin America, Asia and Africa. But I wouldn't read too much more into it. There's more GDP growth outside U.S.\/Canada than there is inside. And that's the main factor that you see a differential growth rate.","Thank you. And thank you, operator. Before ending this call, I'd like to just reiterate how honored I am to lead Marsh & McLennan Companies. I will keep a keen focus on 3 core constituencies: colleagues, clients and shareholders. This call is naturally oriented toward meeting our commitment to shareholders. I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for our 54,000 colleagues for their hard work and professionalism and to our tens of thousands of clients for their belief in Marsh & McLennan.

Today's call is being recorded. Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events and results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.","Please refer to the company's most recent SEC filings, which are available on the MMC website for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Serra, and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","Now, Mike is fighting a bad cold, so we are going to preserve his voice for the Q&A, so Keith will read his script following mine.","Previously, we have talked about how volatility and complexity present unique opportunities for MMC to serve clients in the areas of risk, strategy and people. As we have throughout our history, we will continue to serve as a trusted adviser to our clients on the challenges and opportunities they faced in this dynamic environment.","Another Marsh & McLennan constant is our continued commitment to our core principles. We exist to serve clients. If we do so effectively, we will achieve our revenue and profit objectives. Our success is driven by our ability to execute which is a core differentiator. We are always looking for the smarter way. We have a permanent dissatisfaction with this status quo, and we act with integrity and purpose in all that we do. Our continued commitment to these principles should rank us among elite global growth companies.","In recent months, several high profile transactions have been announced in the insurance industry, including transactions involving trading partners and clients in the P&C and health insurance space, as well as potential combination involving two of our largest direct competitors.","Let me share some observations on their potential impact. Amongst the host of other reasons, a prolonged period of low interest rates and benign loss activity has led to an environment, where pressure is likely to build on underwriting margins and ROEs for the P&C industry.","This reality is even more acute on the reinsurance side of the business, where sharper price declines, alternative capital and higher levels of risk retention are all prevalent. The number of insurance industry transactions and their aggregate value has been significant.","However, the insurance market is very deep and we do not expect these recent deals to alter the overall competitive landscape in any meaningful way. As an example, despite what seems like a lot of consolidation over the last decade, the number of U.S. P&C carriers has actually increased in the last 10 years to more than 1,100 today.","Furthermore, the share of U.S. industry premiums written by the top 5% of carriers is virtually unchanged from a decade ago. We believe the impact of these combinations to MMC and our RIS segment will be modest. In our view, the role of Marsh is even more critical at a time of industry consolidation. Specifically for Guy Carpenter, the combination of a few large clients could lead them to buy less reinsurance; however, we expect this impact will be gradual and limited.","Over the last several years, Guy Carpenter has been a market leader in a tough reinsurance environment, always innovating and finding ways to add value to clients by looking at the entirety of their risk profile. Guy Carpenter has achieved strong levels of new business, broadened the client base by focusing on underserved segments and expanded internationally.","Despite the ongoing challenging environment, we will capitalize on our position as an employer of choice in the reinsurance industry and will continue to add talent and capabilities. Additionally, there have been a number of announced potential transactions among major providers of health insurance. These combinations may better equipped the national carriers to deal with the challenges they face on multiple fronts, such as achieving greater scale and becoming more efficient, expansion in their government programs, the rise of public and private exchanges and consolidation of the provider side of the business.","We do not see this as having any meaningful negative impact on our market position. To the contrary, the proposed combinations of major health insurers makes Mercer's role more relevant as we seek to drive comprehensive plan, designs at competitive terms. Consolidation will cause our clients to have questions about how this impacts them.","As a trusted advisor, there is no company better positioned than Mercer to help clients navigate their health and benefit options in this changing landscape. Lastly, we have recently seen the announcement of the potential merger of two direct competitors.","I fundamentally believe that competition is good. We thrive on it and it makes us better. These firms are good competitors and we expect they will continue to be, if they come together. That said, this really is a potential combination of two separate and quite different businesses that have little overlap. This is not altering the competitive landscape for Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Now, let us turn to our results. Given the broader operating environment, I am pleased with our results for the first half of the year. Over that period, adjusted EPS rose 6%. For the second quarter, underlying revenue was up 3% and adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.80, reflecting the continued effect of macroeconomic headwinds on our earnings.","For our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $445 million and the adjusted operating margin was 25.4%. Through six months, adjusted operating income rose 4%, approaching $1 billion and the adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 27.9%.","At Marsh, revenue was $1.5 billion underlying growth was 3%. The U.S. and Canada division lead the way with underlying revenue growth of 4%, reflecting strong performance from our U.S. operations. Within the U.S. both, our core broking operation and Marsh & McLennan agency had very good performance.","MMA continues to be a strong contributor to revenue growth. In June, we acquired Dallas-based MHBT, one of the nation's largest and highest quality independent insurance brokers. With revenue of $75 million, MHBT will serve as MMA's southwest regional hub.","Also in July, MMA established its presence in Canada with the acquisition of V\u00e9zina, a leading Montr\u00e9al-based firm.","In our international division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, with 3% growth in EMEA, while Asia-Pacific was flat and Latin America grew 5%.","Guy Carpenter's revenue of $275 million declined 2% on an underlying basis. The U.S. and Asia-Pacific were areas of strength. For the six-months, Guy Carpenter's underlying revenue was flat, a reasonable performance given reinsurance industry pressures.","In May, we announced the strengthening of our of our RIS management team. Peter Zaffino became Chairman of the Risk and Insurance Services segment and will continue to serve as Marsh's CEO. Peter was CEO of Guy Carpenter for three years prior to becoming CEO of Marsh in 2011.","His new strategic role is a natural evolution of his deep experience in the reinsurance industry as well as his knowledge of the primary markets. Peter Hearn will join Guy Carpenter as CEO next June. Peter has over 30 years of industry experience and is known for his successful track record of driving growth and innovative thinking in the reinsurance space. He will continue to strengthen Guy Carpenter's position as a premier provider of advice and solutions for clients.","Alex has done an excellent job over the past four years as Guy Carpenter's CEO and will continue as CEO through May 2016. At that point his full attention will be on his role as Chairman of MMC International, which was a part-time focus since 2012. Alex is the ideal person to drive MMC's international growth agenda and will report directly to me.","Moving to consulting, revenue was $1.5 billion in the second quarter, up 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $244 million and the adjusted operating margin increased to 16.4%. Through six months adjusted operating income rose 4% to $491 million and the adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 16.9%.","Mercer's versus revenue was $1 billion, an underlying increase of 4%. Revenue grew across major geographies, including continued solid performance in Europe, growth markets in the United States. All global businesses contributed led by investments at 8% with AUMs now reaching $136 billion.","Talent grew 4%, its third consecutive quarter of growth. Retirement increased revenue by 2% and health rose 3%. Health in the U.S. continues to benefit from Mercer marketplace. This was partially offset by lower revenue in our health and benefits administration business as we execute our strategy to improve profitability.","Mercer continued to broaden its offerings to clients this quarter, with product launches in executive compensation, pension risk exchange and wealth management.","Oliver Wyman's revenue in the second quarter was $441 million, reflecting underlying revenue growth of 3%. We are pleased with Oliver Wyman's underlying growth of 5% for the six months as it builds on mid-teens growth last year. Revenue increases were achieved across all businesses with the exception of financial services, which were off slightly from its record level posted in the same period last year.","In summary, despite substantial macro headwinds in the second quarter, we produced solid underlying revenue growth and EPS in line with our expectations. We expect strong EPS growth over the second half of the year.","For the full-year, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and high single-digit EPS growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at 13% CAGR over the long-term.","With that, let me turn it over to Keith.","Keith Walsh","Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, Marsh & McLennan Companies delivered solid underlying revenue growth in both segments. GAAP EPS was $0.77 and adjusted EPS was $0.80, a slight increase from the second quarter of last year.","As we have previously discussed, results this year are being impacted significantly like two macroeconomic headwinds, the declining global interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar. Based on current FX rates, we expect the macro headwinds to negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.32 this year, an increase from our earlier estimate of $0.30.","The adverse impact in the first quarter was $0.12. In the second quarter, it was $0.07 and we expect $0.07 in the third quarter and $0.06 in the fourth quarter. In this quarter, the headwinds had a greater impact on Risk and Insurance Services than Consulting. We expect the impact will be greater on the Consulting segment in the third and fourth quarters.","Due to the timing of the headwinds and the mitigation action taken in the first quarter, we believe you get a clear picture of our earnings growth and margin improvement by viewing our results on a year-to-date basis. Through the first six months of the year, adjusted operating income increased 4% to $1.4 billion. The adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.6% and adjusted EPS increased 6% to a $1.70. As Dan just discussed, we expect strong EPS growth in the second half of this year.","Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million from a year ago. We recently have been advised that Trident III is harvesting its final two investments. If this occurs in the third quarter, we should recognize investment income similar to the $26 million of investment income in last year's third quarter.","Total debt was $3.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, including $50 million of commercial paper outstanding. Throughout the year, we have utilized the commercial paper market, which provides us with short-term liquidity and gives us greater cash management flexibility. The next debt maturity is a $50 million term loan, due in March of 2016.","Our GAAP tax rate was 27.9% in the second quarter compared with 27.6% in the second quarter of last year. This quarter, we benefited from New York City Tax Reform, which was enacted in April. The tax rate can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and the impact of changes in international and state tax rates. However, for modeling purposes, based on the current landscape, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29.5% in the second half of this year and 29% for 2016.","We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. In May, the Board of Directors renewed a $2 billion share repurchase program. The board also increased the quarterly dividend 11% to $0.31 per share effective with the third quarter payment. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $930 million with approximately $155 million in the U.S.","Uses of cash in the second quarter included $151 million for dividends, $260 million for acquisitions and $475 million to repurchase 8.2 million shares of stock. Through six months, uses of cash included $302 million for dividends, $400 million for acquisitions and investments and $775 million to repurchase 13.5 million shares of stock.","Our share count has now declined five straight quarters and is down almost 3% versus the prior year. We remain on track to exceed the $2.3 billion we used last year for share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions.","With that I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Keith, and well done. Operator, we are ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] first question from Dan Farrell, Piper Jaffray.","Dan Farrell","Thank you and good morning. A question on your tax rate comments, you mentioned I think 29.5% for back half of the year and I think you said 29% in '1, so we are seeing a little incremental decline in sort of the guidance that you put towards that.","I am wondering what is driving that and I am wondering longer-term if you see any opportunities or ways to trying and gradually manage the tax rate down going forward. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Dan. I mean, clearly we have made certain commitments to looking at our global tax position over time and we have invested in a new Head of Global Tax, Dina Shapiro who started with us recently.","Now, it is too early for Dina to have a real impact on moving our tax rate down, but this has been a focus of the company for the last couple of years. I mean, clearly when we look at our competitors, we are at a disadvantage by being a U.S. multi-national vis-\u00e0-vis what tax rate we have versus most of our competitors, so we have to operate the business better. We have to grow faster and we have to have better operating earnings to drive higher pre-tax to arrive at is similar levels on an after-tax basis, so we have been doing that.","The search for tax efficiency for us started several years ago and we are beginning to see some of the benefits from that, but let me hand it over to mike and test that throat of his to see if he has got anything to add.","Mike Bischoff","Yes. Thank you, Dan. You are absolutely right. We are at a disadvantage as an American company, because of the high federal and then state tax rates, but also the issue of any of the international cash that we want to repatriate into the United States has a federal true-up to 35% rate.","Over the last three years, we have really dedicated it a significant amount of resources tax planning and strategies to be able to effectively repatriate cash into the U.S. in a tax efficient manner.","Now that we feel that that is fairly well settled, we can then pivot and turn more of our energies into other opportunities that we may see around the world.","As Dan indicated, we have put additional resources into our tax group, particularly in the international tax planning. When you look at that with regard to where the tax rates on a global basis, for example, the U.K. continues to reduce its corporate tax.","As we indicated in our scripts, New York State a year ago and then followed by New York City effective in April of this year reduced their tax rate, so when we look at everything across the year, we feel that our tax rate for the second half of the year most likely will fall in the 29.5%, but because of all of these strategies and where we think we see some additional opportunities, it should be 29% as the base rate going forward.","Dan Farrell","Okay. Great. Then one other quick question if I can. In the Risk and Insurance Services, you mentioned, I think that a lot of the currency headwind was there yet the margins looked like they held up fairly well, which would imply, I think some nice, underlying margin growth even though the organic was only moderate.","I am wondering what you see driving that margin growth. Are you still seeing some expense efficiencies and how do you think about that as we move forward? Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Sure. In terms of business performance, our main objective is to drive revenue and earnings growth. Secondary objective of ours is to improve our margins in both segments and we view that really as a natural outcome of growing revenues faster than expenses almost all the time.","Now, periodically, we are going to grow expenses faster than revenue for opportunistic reasons, but we are very careful on that and it would not last for very long. When we look at RIS and Consulting margins, we think it is best to look at year-to-date and really a full-year basis, because mitigation against some of the headwinds we were facing felt so heavily in the first quarter, you really have to look over a longer period of time for this year, so we do expect to have margin expansion in both segments this year.","Dan Farrell","Thank you very much.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Sure. Next question please?","Operator","Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg","Hey, good morning. Just staying on that subject, can you give us what the underlying margin change was in the second quarter adjusted for the headwinds? I think you gave that number in the first.","Keith Walsh","Well, I think I would start by saying if you look specifically at, say, RIS, the overall margin in the second quarter for the company was flat at 19.9%, but year-to-date for the whole company is 21.6%, so it is up 120 bps on a year-to-date basis.","As I was just saying to Dan, I think you might get the wrong kind of outcomes if you look in two shorter periods for this year, because the mitigation in the first quarter really does have an overextended effect on where margins are.","Even if I broke down the margins for you, we were reluctant to in the first quarter, because as you remember in the 100s of basis point improvement on margins, which is really did not jive with the level of growth we were having on the top-line.","Even though it looks more reasonable on a year-to-date basis and the margin increases come down a bit, so it is more credible in terms of overall performance. It is still not the most accurate of pictures, so all I could say is, be patient and bear with us. As we go through the year, you will see the more active margin improvement.","If I give you a little bit more than that, it would just be, we look at this year not that too similarly to how we look at last year in terms of overall company performance on margins. Maybe a little bit better, maybe a little bit worse, but we are kind of in the same ball game and as we had said before, Consulting, we expect to come off the very large pace of 150-basis point, 160-basis point annual margin improvement and we expected RIS to actually improve a little bit from last year our margin, so that is about as much color as I think it is credible at this point in time.","Larry Greenberg","Okay. That is fair. I mean, it would be helpful to us, I think, just kind of back test the numbers we are using in our models, but certainly I understand the point.","Then I think Dan you mentioned that you had a bit slower growth in health at Mercer and you are changing some things to improve profitability. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit?","Dan Glaser","Sure. Julio, you want to take that?","Julio Portalatin","Sure. Thank you, Larry. Health remains a pretty profitable and growing business for Mercer. It will continue to be there as time goes on. As I discussed in the last call, we decided a few years ago to incorporate our benefit admin business into our line of businesses just to remind you of that action that we took. In this particular case health and benefits administration business or outsourcing was actually incorporated to our health segment.","When we did that, the results have been pretty positive, because of course now we have a PNL Manager, managing the full breadth of the business that is necessary to deliver our solutions and of course attention is being given to both, top-line opportunity as well as bottom-line opportunity.","Part of those decisions had to do with of course on the bottom-line improvement, our client and retention of some of the businesses that perhaps over time had just not been able to meet the margin and profitability targets of our business.","Because of that, you take all these elements into the impact, Mercer marketplace impact of course of revenue growth, core H&B, revenue growth and then you take the impact of the good actions that we are taking to improve profitability administration. You basically have similar type of growth patterns that you have had traditionally with the health business.","Operator","We will go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning. First question, Dan, thank you for the extensive remark on the industry consolidation, a just follow up on that and for Marsh specifically, what you think Marsh will play a role in this industry consolidation? Do you see either organic or inorganic opportunities?","Dan Glaser","I will start with that and then I will handover to Peter for more commentary. Let me address inorganic first, because I do not really think that that would be spurred in any way by the insurance company level consolidation you have seen.","When we consider Marsh, Marsh has an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities. They work that pipeline over generally a number of years in developing relationships with companies in the RIS space, so you know I would say it is mainly focused on organic.","Our view is that Marsh as a trusted advisor is an incredibly valuable resource to clients and it is on the client side of the table. It is not a seller of insurance, but actually operates as assisting clients analyze their risk profile and as a buyer of insurance once the design and placement structures are agreed on with the client.","When we look what we look at the consolidation in the business overall on the insurance company side, you know, it will be taking larger world-class kind of firms in many instances and putting them together. over the long-term, we really expect that to have additional value for our clients in terms of broader product, new product, better financial kind of stability the industry overall, so you know it is sort of is consistent with the way many of our clients, particularly our largest clients think about the business where they want to have fewer deeper, more strategic relationships with fewer capital providers, but Peter, you want to have to that?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. What I would Dan is, just that as you mentioned being advocates of clients is making sure that we are working closely with the insurance companies in the consolidation on strategy, how they intend to integrate the organizations and how that affects risk appetite. There could be some overlap today on signings, so how do we manage through that.","Also, there could be specific geographies whether overweigh, under weigh underway and making sure that we are giving our clients real-time advice on how they interact with the companies after consolidation.","That is great. Just a follow-up on the capital management side, it looks like the pace of the buyback has been faster than last year. You understand the full-year of buyback amount in the first half. I just wondered will the pace be sustained and what is source of funding for the buyback, do you need to increase your leverage to fund the buybacks. Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Let me start with that and then I will hand over to Mike if I leave him any room, because he is well drilled me over the past couple of years in how we think about capital management in general, but as we outlined on Investor Day, we expected to have higher levels of cash all to be deployed on a go forward basis and that was generally from three factors, higher free cash flow owing to our string of strong operating results and our improving operating performance, declining calls on our cash and also optimizing our balance sheet and we explained how over time we expected to reduce the cash on our balance sheet and also grow our leverage over time.","We have been doing that and it is a very balanced strategy so when we think about after reinvesting in our people and our existing businesses, there is basically three ways that we deploy our cash, M&A, dividends and share repurchase.","M&A, as we have said before can be lumpy. We do not have a budget around M&A, we talked to a lot of people, but we do not do many deals, so from that standpoint we have done about $400 million of M&A through the first two quarters of this year, which is similar to the pace that we had last year, but I could not tell you what the back half of the year is going to look like.","What I can say is, the pipeline looks about like it did over the last several years, not much higher, not much lower, but the conversations are kind of continuing. Then you look at dividends, we are very happy that we recently raised our dividend 11%. That is our second consecutive year of double-digit increases and that is one of the commitments we made at Investor Day.","Also what we said at Investor Day is that we intended to shrink our share count every year, so we are very happy that this is our 13th straight quarter of buyback and the fixed-rate quarter that we have actually reduced our share count, so that story continues. What I could not say is whether we were going to keep the same pace of what we had in the first half of the year going out into the future, not only in the back half, but also beyond.","What I can say is that we will remain active in share repurchase that we will repurchase a meaningful amount of shares and that we will do that virtually every quarter over the course of time.","Mike, did I leave you any room?","Mike Bischoff","I have got to say a very comprehensive answer. I would only touch on two points that you already made Dan, on cash. We have worked through the last two years to get at our excess cash, we have been reducing that, we effectively reduced it and not just through the end of last year, but through the first six months of this year, which we obviously apply to share repurchase.","The second point I would just make with regard to the question, with regard do we need any additional debt capacity or offerings over the second half of this year to reach the goals that we have set, the answer is no. We have been working over three years to re-craft our debt portfolio. We really do not have anything meaningful renewing until 2017, so by reducing our cash and basically dealing with all the debts funding gives us an opportunity to manage our working capital needs with regard to commercial paper, which we are doing more this year.","Now, having said we do not need to go to the capital markets this year, never say never. We do not know when opportunities will present themselves, but it is not a requirement.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much for all of the answers.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Thanks, Kai. Next question please.","Operator","Jay Gelb, Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan Glaser","Good morning.","Jay Gelb","With regard to the Willis-Towers Watson transaction, my sense is typically that there is some level of dislocation of any two companies is going through a major merger. I am wondering if that offers Marsh or Mercer the opportunity to perhaps pick up additional business or perhaps.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Jay. We are not going to comment about Willis and Towers and that potential combination other than how it relates to us, so you know the way we view it is how it relates to us is basically, we are focused outside the shop in terms of growing our business, serving clients, getting new clients, expanding our business and recruiting people strategically. We are doing all of those things.","When I think about our company overall, this is very much a people business. In my view not just in RIS, but across Marsh & McLennan Companies, we really are a talent magnet. We have a caliber of people that is quite high, smart, creative committed people. You know what we have found over time is smart, creative, committed people like working with smart, creative and committed people, so we are doing meaningful work for clients here, work that is interesting and it is impactful.","I mean, you can pick up a newspaper any day and look at various articles in that newspaper and it is like Marsh & McLennan is all over those kind of issues and challenges that our clients are facing, so I also think we benefit frankly, particularly, in the RIS segment from a proven leadership team that is from the business, you know, that that grew up in the business, that understand the nuances of the business and I expected that that will reap benefits or Marsh & McLennan on the client side over a long stretch of time.","Jay Gelb","That is helpful. Thanks Dan. My separate question is on the third quarter boost from investment income. If that is $26 million pre-tax in the third quarter, I think that work starts around $0.03 to $0.04 a share after-tax. Was that inclusive of your initial of your view that EPS growth will be stronger in the back half and also the ability to get high single-digit EPS growth for the full-year or will that additional revenue, that $26 million, would that be essentially offset by reinvestments in the business. I am just trying to get a perspective of whether that investment income boost was taken into account in terms of your ability to generate the high single-digit EPS growth this year.","Dan Glaser","I think what you have to first do is look back at last year, because it is really not much of a boost. It is pretty consistent with the investment income that we earned in the third quarter of 2014. From that standpoint, it does not really do much for our EPS growth when compared to last year, because if we did not have it then it would be an additional headwind that we would have to make up.","In terms of your question about do we need that to get to high single-digit, it is kind of too early for us to tell. I am glad we have it, but ultimately we feel very comfortable with kind of the high single-digit basis of how we expect to achieve the year, but Mike you have got something to add?","Mike Bischoff","Yes. The one thing I would add, and Jay, a very good question with regard to headwinds. As we indicated in our scripts, the headwinds now that we are facing for the totality of the year has been from $0.30 to $0.32, but actually in the second half of the year it increases by $0.03, so you can also hear from our statements that we have not backed away from any of the earlier guidance that we gave with regard to how we think the year looks in the second half of the year, so that basically says that we can absorb an additional $0.03 of headwinds.","By the way, with regard to the amount of investment income coming in the quarter you said could it be $0.03 or $0.04. I think, it is more like $0.03.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that Mike. It is probably worth noting as well that that FX headwind this year is probably a 10% headwind to EPS growth, right?","Dan Glaser","Yes. If you look at EPS on year-to-date basis, we have grown 6%, but if you looked on a constant currency basis, we would be 12% or 13%. If you factor that in terms of our view of being able to grow in the high single-digit on a constant currency, that would put you in that 13%, 14% area on a constant currency EPS growth.","Jay Gelb","Make sense. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi. Good morning.","Dan Glaser","Good morning.","Sarah DeWitt","On Guy Carpenter, could you talk about what drove the decline in organic growth this quarter? Given the challenging reinsurance market condition, do you think you can still grow organically in this business going forward in the near-term to medium-term?","Dan Glaser","Sure. Alex, you want to take that?","Alex Moczarski","I have stated in the last call that we thought that the second quarter will be clunky and difficult. I would kind of look at the year-to-date and they say that we are flat. I still believe that we will finish flattish for the year.","Luckily, know we have been working on diversifying our portfolio for quite a while now through segmentation by client size, by an appetite also through product, so we have a pretty robust portfolio spread across different geographies as well as through different client type.","I am still optimistic that it is a good business and we are the employer of choice. We have a list of people who want to come and join us. We have had some good wins recently, the pipeline looks good going forward. Also I take comfort from the fact that the U.S. is showing good results. I am cautiously confidence that we will be in good shape.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Sarah any other question?","Sarah DeWitt","No. Thank you for the answer.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Thank You. Next question operator.","Operator","Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning everyone. I am wondering if we can talk a little about the next year outlook Oliver Wyman and where are you seeing growth and where you are seeing some maybe moderation?","Dan Glaser","Okay. Let me just make one comment before I hand it over to Scott, because I am actually very pleased with Oliver Wyman's growth performance this quarter. When you think about whether it is coming on top of last year. I mean, in the second quarter, they grew 3%. They grew 17% in the second quarter of 2014, so it is showing quite a bit of strength in Oliver Wyman, but Scott you want to talk a little bit about the outlook?","Scott McDonald","Sure. Josh, we are very happy with the business at the moment. We think over the medium-term, we are still targeting mid to high single-digit growth. We think all the fundamentals are in place and we are in a competitively good position.","We also think we should grow faster than MMC overall. Given we are smaller we should be able to take market share more easily. I think for 2015 overall given that we are growing off the back of the strong mid-teens growth from last year, it could be a little lower than that guidance, but the first half has been good at 5% and we see good prospects in the second half.","Dan Glaser","Any other question, Josh?","Josh Shanker","Is there a line of business that you can indulge us with a little bit? I mean, how banking is doing and what not?","Dan Glaser","Sure. The first half of the year was pretty much strong across all sectors, with a couple of exceptions and therefore different reasons. Energy was slow for obvious reasons. That industry is just under pressure. Telecommunications was slow for similar although not quite as intent reasons and RFS business was slightly slower, but it grew at more than 20% last year, so they are just struggling to grow off the back that is still a fundamentally very strong business.","Then regionally, I mean the U.S. and our international markets, so all of Asia, Middle East, Latin America are very strong and Europe is the one part of the portfolio which is a little weaker compared to the last year although we are already seeing some signs of that picking up.","Josh Shanker","Excellent, and I wonder if we can sort of do the same sort of postmortem on a little bit of turbulence around Asia Pacific in the RIS segment.","Dan Glaser","Sure. I think you are referring to Marsh within the segment, because...","Josh Shanker","Yes. Marsh.","Dan Glaser","Because they are actually Guy Carpenter did reasonably well in Asia-Pac in the quarter, but Peter, you want to give some color on Marsh?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. Sure. Asia Pacific, we were not pleased with the flat growth. Within the region Pacific was more responsible for that than Asia. When I look at Pacific, its economic slowdown, some lower new business, lower construction, some pressure on pricing contributed to the results in the quarter.","Asia, the underlying fundamentals are still strong. I mean, they had a very tough comparable year-over-year with having 15% organic growth in the second quarter 2014. That was coupled with about 600 basis points of non-recurring business that was a delta in new business year-over-year, so they had a real challenge and they still grew up.","Overall, the margins are still strong in the region and I expect to have better performance if you look at the full-year and Asia-Pac is still a meaningful contributor to overall Marsh.","Josh Shanker","I do not mean to beat the dead horse, in trying to think about things, is 1Q or 2Q or maybe first half of 2015 totality is more indicative how we should think about things going forward?","Dan Glaser","Yes. I think, when you look at the company in RIS specifically, we still very much live in the 3% to 5% organic growth world. Just a couple of reminders on the history of our performance, if you look back at, say, 2012, RIS grew 7% in the first quarter followed by a 6, 4 and 2 in the fourth quarter and I am sure it seemed to everybody like the world was coming to an end. Then in the next nine quarters were 3% or better.","I do not think you can look at one quarter in this business as being indicative of what a trend looks like and we are comfortable going forward. Clearly, we are adding another headwind that we did not have, so in terms of property and casualty pricing is under even more pressure than it was before.","In an overall sense, that in some ways will get at least partially offset by better economic outlooks in many parts of the world other than, say, the commodity types of countries that Peter was referring to like Australia and Canada as examples, but Peter do you have anything to add?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. I just would suggest when we look at international, we should look at the full-year heavily dominated by Continental Europe in the first quarter, and we had some anomalies in the second, so I think you have a much more accurate picture of what the growth rate is going to be if we look at the full-year.","Dan Glaser","The next question please?","Operator","Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is just more follow-up on the broker M&A. Two of your biggest competitors in the consulting side are now operating or will be operating at a lower tax rate and the recent merger Willis and Towers appears to at least have been partially motivated by tax. Why should we not think of your higher tax rate as a competitive disadvantage in the consulting business?","Peter Zaffino","I think, when you first look at it, you have to look at it in overall company's profile and what its advantages are and what its disadvantages are. One thing is, in our review we would not change our strategic positioning with any other company in our space, even with their tax advantage, so we have to do things in our business to make up for the fact that U.S. companies operate at a tax disadvantage relative to the rest of the world.","Now, I take with a glimmer of hope the fact that if New York state and New York City can actually change the tax rate anything is possible in the future, but ultimately it is something that we operate our business at a high performance level, we will continue to do that, we will not use the tax disadvantage that we have in certain areas as any kind of caveat or excuse to our performance. We will continue to perform well in the marketplace over a long period of time and we certainly do not feel disadvantaged vis-\u00e0-vis any of our competitors.","Ryan Tunis","That is helpful. Then I guess my follow-up was just on health organic. I guess this is the second quarter where there has been a little bit of a drag I guess from benefit admin. That has made you guys come in a little bit below core. I am wondering how long we should expect that to put pressure on that reported organic number of it is just sort of 2015-type event or this is a longer process?","Dan Glaser","Julio, do want to take that?","Julio Portalatin","Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. As you know when you make decisions that are associated with especially the ben admin business, it does have some quarters before it runs itself through completely right? I would think if you look at the underlying growth that should be of big attention for folks like yourself and others.","Again, if you back out the ben admin impact, the underlying core growth of our business continues to be very healthy as expected similar to previous years. You are likely to see these types of impact again can quarter-by-quarter as time goes, because you make the right decisions as far as keeping your focus on both, top-line and bottom-line, so we will see how it goes as we continue to make those decisions with clients.","Remember that clients come up for renewal and we have conversations. Generally speaking, we land in a good place, where both of us see it as a win-win. In some cases, we do not, so it is not as predictable as you would like it to be.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks so much.","Dan Glaser","Next question please?","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning.","Dan Glaser","Good morning.","Elyse Greenspan","Just quickly on the headwind of $0.07 that you pointed to in the Q2. Is there any way that we can get the impact between both, currency and pension as well as just the impact on each of the two segments?","Dan Glaser","Mike, you want to take that?","Mike Bischoff","Yes. Roughly it works out to about $60 million of NOI headwinds. Within that, it would be a little bit higher in FX and a little bit lower on the average in the net retirement plans.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Then in terms of the breakdown between RIS and Consulting?","Mike Bischoff","Like we said on the script, the overall impact in the second quarter was felt more in RIS than it was in consulting. With regard to the magnitude, I would say within $5 million, $7 million between the two segments, but then we expect that to flip for the second half of the year.","Consulting, we really feel more, the broader the headwinds, which is another reason why Dan continues to say that the margins and the growth, in the different segment are better when you look at how we deal with these headwinds year-to-date. As the management team, we are cognizant of these headwinds and we make management decisions throughout the year aware of that, so that is why we keep pointing people to the year-to-date.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. Then in terms of Mercer Marketplace, as we had towards next year's enrollment season, just any update Julio that you can give on the conversations that you are having with companies surrounding moving over to your exchange. Then also, do you expect there to maybe be fallout and some opportunities associated with the merger that Towers Watson is going through? Thank you.","Julio Portalatin","You are welcome. Yes. I want to first just generally comment about the potential merger of our two competitors. First things, we know the firms pretty well. Of course, they are good competitors. From our perspective, we are going to continue to execute our strategy and our strategy is to stay focused on the things that already are working for us and even have more focus on the things that are beginning to pick up pace, things like Mercer Marketplace, our international expansion of global footprint, with our global clients and of course our investments business continues to do well and we continue to invest in those things.","These are actions that we control of course. If anything, these things kind of just pinpoint your focus even that much more in terms of really being able to execute the pace and intensity. Having said that, a little bit on the exchanges, as you know we reported last in October about our exchange results and you are pretty familiar with those as it is.","Some additional color that might be helpful to you is that, there is a lot of discussion around fully insured versus self-insured and we are seeing a trend that basically shows that there is more clients now going self-insured than we had seen in our first 60 or so clients that they went first to Mercer Marketplace as far as the DC DB distribution. About two-thirds of the DB, one-third is DC.","As you know, we are still in the active season. Right now, we are moving more towards implementation, execution, delivering to our client, but there is also the off cycle opportunities that we have, especially in the middle market that we continue to work through.","Our focus is to continue to sell the value proposition of Mercer Marketplace, continue to be able to increase our pipeline, talk to our clients about any concerns as they have especially as we think about the Cadillac tax coming up in 2018 or as I call the previous tax as I they really do believe that it affects much more than what people may believe. We believe that somewhere in the first in 2018, if nothing is done some, somewhere about 30% to 40% of clients may be able to Cadillac tax, so there is a lot of discussion going on there.","Although Mercer Marketplace or exchanges are not the silver bullet to deal with the Cadillac tax, it certainly allows for flexibility for you to be able to implement certain actions against something like a Cadillac tax. Overall, we are pleased, pipeline is strong and we will continue to focus on delivering to our clients.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Elyse. Operator, I think, we have time for one or two more questions if we go reasonably rapidly so\u2026","Operator","Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks. I just got a quick one here, Dan.","Dan Glaser","Okay.","Brian Meredith","On your Guy Carpenter and the reinsurance, just curious a couple of senior hires that you have made of late, obviously, Peter Hearn and a couple of others. Are those hires - because maybe you see kind of bottoming out here or in the reinsurance growth area, some demand picking up or is there some other reasons why you have decided to add talent at this point?","Dan Glaser","Well, I would start by saying no. We are not recruiting strategically, because we see a bottoming and reinsurance. We are recruiting strategically, because we can. I think this is a situation where we are committed to the reinsurance business, it is a tough environment right now, but in a lot of ways using our strength in that kind of environment to build our capabilities and our talent is opportunistic and we certainly are looking broadly.","Even though with Peter Hearn, we hired from one competitor. It is not that we are just looking to add talent from a single competitor. We are actually doubling down in our reinsurance business and looking to add talent this year and next year as we invest through the cycle.","Brian Meredith","I am just curious, why now?","Dan Glaser","Yes. I think it is more opportunity than anything else. I mean, let me talk a little bit about our RIS structural changes. Then I think we can call it day from there, because I think it is all part and parcel of the way we view the market.","I mean, to us the RIS world is changing. How much is secular and permanent and how much is cyclical is unclear, but what is clear is that we are in active period of consolidation, it is a softening market, there is certain of the larger insurance companies are retaining more risk, there has certainly been an increase in alternative capital and an increase in alternative has to capital.","There has also been an increase in the facilities, program, specialty, placement and an increase in the increased need for analytics, so you put all of those things together and I do not think there is a company better positioned in the world than Marsh & McLennan to take advantage of that volatility and uncertainty that exists in the market.","We are in a terrific position in terms of being able to invest despite some headwinds and we have no doubt that over time that turns around and some of those headwinds become tailwinds. We are very excited about our new structure in RIS. I think it gives us the opportunity to get specialist, whether it is placement specialist, program designed specialist, analytics perfect professionals collaborating more between Guy Carpenter and Marsh, they will help us promote growth, help us avoid cost duplication and it is certainly utilizes the talents of our executive team most effectively. For a whole variety of reasons, we view this as a good time to be an investor in this business.","I will just end by saying that we are optimistic not only for the back half of this year, where we expect to have solid performance, but also as we look to next year, we have been working hard this year to make sure that if FX and interest rates are about where they are today that even though those headwinds would continue to exist, we take steps to improve our business and to have a good EPS performance next year, so we are quite optimistic where we sit today.","With that I think it is time to end the call operator. I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and specifically I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication and serving them. Have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"14085":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Glaser ","Thanks Sherry and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. ","I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald, who was named CEO of Oliver Wyman Group on January 1st. Scott succeeds John Drzik who has moved to Marsh to become President of Global Risks and Specialties, overseeing Marsh's Global Industries and practices, analytics and technologies in the Insurer Consulting Group. John has also been named Chairman of the newly formed MMC Global Risk Center where he will strengthen collaboration on risk issues across the firm. This exemplifies the depth of our senior management team and our successful efforts to move talent throughout the organization. Also with us this morning is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. ","I am very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which capped an excellent year for MMC. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, exceeding the increase in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 22 of the past 23 quarters, a record that stands out in the industry. Our consolidated adjusted margin rose 130 basis points to 16.3%, our highest fourth quarter margin in a decade. ","In the Risk and Insurance Services segment, adjusted operating income grew 9% and the margin expanded 80 basis points to 20%. Marsh had strong underlying revenue growth of 4% in the quarter, the international operations rose 4% and the U.S. Canada division grew 3%. ","Guy Carpenter generated underlying revenue growth of 6% its best performance in 2013. In the Consulting segment adjusted operating income grew 16% and the margin expanded 160 basis points to 14.9%. ","Mercer grew underlying revenue 4% for the third consecutive quarter driven by outstanding results in health and investments. Oliver Wyman\u2019s 5% increase in underlying revenue was its strongest performance in the past six quarters, reflecting significant growth in financial services. ","For the year we delivered underlying revenue growth of 3% while managing underlying adjusted expense growth to 1%. This produced strong operating leverage with 14% growth in adjusted operating income and an increase in the adjusted operating margin of 180 basis points to 17.4%. ","Adjusted EPS increased 15%. In 2013 each of our segments produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. Notably this was the fourth quarter consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and margin expansion in both segments. In recent years we've made tremendous progress in improving productivity, capturing efficiencies and reducing risk. ","This progress was driven in part by investments in our businesses. One indicator of our level of investment is capital expenditures which has increased over 40% from two years ago. We are well positioned to deliver on our long-term goal of 13% annual EPS growth. ","In Risk and Insurance Services revenue for 2013 was $6.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $1.5 billion. This represents the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth in adjusted operating income. The adjusted margin rose 150 basis points to 22.1%, the highest in a decade. To put the outstanding long term performance of this segment into perspective, since 2007 adjusted operating income has more than tripled and the adjusted margin has expanded by more than 1,300 basis points. ","At Marsh revenue was $5.4 billion in 2013 as all major geographic regions contributed to underlying revenue growth of 3%. In the U.S. Canada division underlying growth was 2%. The international division expanded 4% as solid underlying revenue growth continue throughout Marsh's vast international footprint. ","Marsh continued to produce strong levels off new business with $1.1 billion for the year a new annual record. Last week Marsh & McLennan Agency announced the acquisition of San Diego based Barney & Barney, the country's 34th largest insurance brokerage firm with 100 million of annual revenue, 500 employees, strong leadership and an outstanding record of growth. Barney & Barney will be MMA's Western regional hub. ","Marsh has also continued to expand its international footprint. Recent acquisitions include the leading insurance advisors in Peru, the Dominican Republic and most recently in Scotland where Marsh acquired Central Insurance Services. ","Guy Carpenter produced record revenue of $1.1 billion in 2013, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Three quarters of this growth came from outside of Guy Carpenter's 25 largest clients reflecting our strategy to broaden relationships by customer size and geography. ","Revenue growth was broad-based across North America, international, global specialties and UK Facultative. Guy Carpenter has grown organically for 20 straight quarters with average annual underlying revenue growth of 5%. As a result of building headwinds, including record levels of capacity, higher risk retentions by clients and significant rate reductions seen in January we currently expect modest underlying revenue growth at Guy Carpenter in 2014. ","In 2013 the Consulting segment continue to make substantial progress to increase profitability. Revenue was $5.7 billion, up 2% on an underlying basis. Focused expense management held underlying adjusted expenses flat, producing adjusted operating income of $847 million, an increase of 100 million or 13% from the prior year, and the segment\u2019s margin increased 160 basis points to 14.9%. ","Mercer had solid underlying revenue growth, fueling record profitability. Revenue was $4.2 billion, an underlying increase of 4% for the third consecutive year. This was driven by health and investments, which led the way with increases of 6% and 9% respectively. Growth was spread across all geographic reasons. ","We have experienced success in the U.S. healthcare exchange space with the launch of Mercer marketplace which just last month became a standalone division within Mercer. Mercer marketplace has delivered a differentiated platform to both middle market and large clients.","Oliver Wyman\u2019s underlying revenue growth steadily improved throughout the year culminating with strong fourth quarter growth of 5%. For the year revenue was $1.5 billion, a modest decrease from 2012 as solid growth in financial services, Lippincott, NERA and the international regions was offset by declines in other practices. ","In summary, MMC\u2019s excellent performance in the fourth quarter and full year represents the continuation of our strong earnings momentum. We are especially proud of our record of generating consistent earnings growth. ","Adjusted EPS rose 13% in 2011, 16% in 2012 and 15% this past year and over the three year period the adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points. We are well positioned to deliver on our long term goals, which should lead to superior returns for our shareholders.","With that let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, MMC's revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13%. The consolidated margin increased 130 basis points to 16.3%, and adjusted EPS grew to $0.57 from $0.52 in the prior year. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS included $24 million of expense or $0.03 per share due to the early extinguishment of debt. ","Full year result, MMC's revenue rose 3% on an underlying basis to a record $12.3 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 14%, with the margin increasing 180 basis points from 15.6% to 17.4%. GAAP EPS increased 14% and adjusted EPS grew 15%. ","Investment income was $11 million in the fourth quarter. While difficult to forecast we anticipate investment income could approach $10 million in the first quarter. MMC's tax rate for the year was 30% on both the GAAP and adjusted basis, which is also appropriate to use for modeling purposes this year. ","Interest expense in the fourth quarter decreased to $43 million which reflects the debt funding that occurred last fall. Most likely we will utilize the commercial paper market this quarter for the first time since 2007 and as we approach the July $320 million debt maturity we will refine our thinking concerning the amount and term of the refinancing. ","Now let\u2019s turn to MMC pension plans. We would like to update you on the funded status, cash contributions, changes to our U.K. pension plans and pension expense for the year. At the end of 2012 on a GAAP basis the net funded status of our global defined benefit plans was a deficit of $1.5 billion. At the end of 2013 this has moved to a surplus of approximately $100 million. The significant improvement was due to strong market returns, cash contributions and an increase in the discount rate of 85 basis points in the U.S. ","Last year we made total cash contributions to our defined benefit plans of $650 million. The anticipated funding this year is approximately $200 million. ","Changes to our UK pension plans; after an in-depth review UK retirement plans we are implementing a new defined contribution plan effective in August. We're moving from several diverse plans to one unified competitive easy offering for all UK colleagues. We anticipate very modest impact on profitability from this change. ","Based upon the year-end measurement which takes into account such factors as the discount rate, asset returns, mortality, inflation, salary increases and cash contributions, annual pension expense will decrease in 2014 for the first time since 2008. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in pension expense, net of compensation considerations will be approximately $0.10 per share. ","The impact of foreign exchange on MMC's operations throughout the year could partially offset this benefit. If exchange rates at the end of January hold for the remainder of the year EPS will be reduced by $0.05 per share. Less than half of this relates to our four major currencies Sterling, euro, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. Unlike prior years the currency impact from emerging markets could be meaningful. We expect minimal impact in the first quarter from the foreign exchange with the greatest impact coming in the second quarter. In summary we believe the net result of the pension benefit and the FX impact could increase EPS by $0.05 this year. ","Moving on to cash; cash on the balance sheet at year-end was $2.3 billion of which $940 million was in the United States. These cash levels anticipate payments for variable compensation, several recent acquisitions, the largest being Barney & Barney and returning capital to shareholders. Our cash utilization in the fourth quarter included a $139 million for dividends and a $150 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares marking seven consecutive quarters of share buybacks. ","For the year we bought back 13.2 million shares for $550 million. We plan to continue our share repurchase program in the first quarter. ","With that I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We'll have our first question from Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley. ","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Hi, good morning guys. Great quarter and great year, congratulations. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Thanks a lot, Greg.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Wanted to ask a bit about the organic growth, specifically in Guy Carpenter, I mean it was the best quarter of the year and your competitors are in some way showing the same not quite as strong but still decent growth also. What's the disconnect between the top line performance in global reinsurance brokerage and the pricing declines that seem so widespread across the reinsurance marketplace? ","And if you could tie that to why you think you will be able to grow that business this year as you stated in your outlook that would be great. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","That's great. It is Dan; I'll take the first part of that and then hand over to Alex to give a bit more detail. Let's say a few things, you have to really to really look at what has happened in reinsurance brokerage and advisory over the last number of years, five, six year period. There has been very few players who have been able to build out very strong advisory capabilities. And so it's not just the reinsurance transaction that drives results any more. ","In many ways Guy Carpenter is far closer to their client, their client base than any other advisor with those clients. And so the [inaudible] of reinsurance companies come to rely very heavily on the advice and capabilities, analytic capabilities, relationship of Guy Carpenter. So it's a more balanced organization than it was in the past. ","Having said that, obviously rating levels have an impact because they do participate in transactions but it maybe more muted than it had been, five or ten years ago, but Alex, you want to give us some more detail.","Alexander S. Moczarski ","Yes, sure, the fourth quarter was a great quarter for us. It\u2019s not a very big cat's quarter. And it\u2019s really in the cat space that prices have fallen so much. First quarter is quite a strong cat quarter for us. However, the reason why we believe it will grow is one, we have a very effective segmentation strategy which has allowed us to increase our penetration in mutual market, the excess and surplus markets, our international footprints continue to grow. So we feel good that we can encapsulate some growth in this year.","Daniel S. Glaser ","And one thing I would just like to say is that because January 1 is a big date and it\u2019s a big transactional date when we\u2019re looking at Guy Carpenter for the year we are expecting to see modest growth and are not quite sure what we will see in the first quarter. So we\u2019re really looking at GC over the course of the year rather than in one individual quarter.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Okay, okay great and then shifting gears entirely towards the capital deployment, you guys bought back a lot of stock on the year at least you bought back more than you have in many years. Yet, the share count still is not yet going down. When do you expect the impact of the more aggressive share repo to impact the share count?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Okay, first of all I am glad you noticed that we have been buying back more shares because that is certainly something that we are committed to and being really a consistent buyer of our own company shares is something that this management team is very interested in. Your specific question in terms of share count and vending that share count is important to us as well, and Mike, you want to give us more flavor.","J. Michael Bischoff","Yeah, I\u2019d be more than happy to and thanks for the question, Greg, and I apologize it is going to be a little bit more detailed but I think you need to have color in how we look at it. As I talked on the third quarter call, if you go back to the end of \u201809 the overhang on potential shares outstanding because of colleague equity grants in previous years was about 69 million shares that included stocks options and restricted stock units of various kinds. ","If you look at what that overhang has worked its way down to by at the end of this year it was actually 26.8 million shares. So what that meant, Greg, is that in the last few years we have seen a significant amount of stock options exercised from prior years is probably close to 13.5 million total shares, including restricted stock grants in 2012 and about 14.5 million in 2013. ","So if you do the math if 14.5 million shares were required for this overhang to work down in 2013 and we repurchased 13.2 million shares the actual net change was 1.2 million. So now to go to the heart of your question, with that history and backdrop we think that the overhang has been significantly worked down. We can never totally know what the amount of stock options exercised would be in any given year. But in aggregate we are modeling for 2014 and most likely 2015 only half the levels that we saw in 2012 and 2013. ","So as Dan and I have indicated we plan to continue our share repurchases program. It\u2019s the balance with regard to other return of capital to shareholders, acquisition, investing in the business that we think we will start to bend that curve down this year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Thank you. Great\u2026","J. Michael Bischoff","Sorry, you have something else, Greg?","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Well, if I may just to clarify, Mike it was incredibly detailed, just roughly half of what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the exercises, that's roughly 7 million you just bought back 13 million shares. So we should be seeing I\u2019m just giving you the math back, you know, five plus million decrease in share count all else being equal, if you were to do the same exact buyback activity this year as before, is that what you said?","J. Michael Bischoff","That\u2019s what I said but all else is equal the average stock price we would hope goes up this year but we can\u2019t control that factor.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","That\u2019s perfect, great, thanks for the clarity.","J. Michael Bischoff","Plus I imagine that sometime in next month some of our colleagues will be expecting to receive some more shares. But fortunately we took that into account. ","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Great year, guys thanks. ","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Greg. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Next question please. ","Operator","Larry Greenberg, Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, Mike, just a little bit on the pension. I mean is there a big difference on the impact of financial markets on the U.S. versus the UK and is there some negotiating or messaging that goes on, on the UK side of things? And then secondly, just looking for little bit of an update on Marsh Agency and where things stand there?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Okay. So Mike will handle first part of that question and we'll pass over to Peter Zaffino who will give us some more color around MMA, the Marsh McLennan agency. So Mike, pension.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, Larry and let me to talk to the point Larry and if I don't specifically address your question please come back to me before we go to agencies, but if you look at our global plans there at the end of 2013 there were about $13.6 billion of assets and as I indicated about $13.5 billion of liabilities which puts us on a global basis a net surplus of $100 million.","If you look at the size of respective major geographies the UK is our largest plan very over funded and assets about $7.7 billion and liabilities on a GAAP basis about $6.8 billion. The next question, the U.S. I think with regard to the mix of the assets that are allocated for the portfolios roughly in the U.S. and the UK and we've disclosed that in the 10-K but the UK is a little bit more geared towards bonds. I think it's 50% of what they call return seeking assets, heavily geared towards equities and 50% bonds. So the rate of return on those assets is typically a little bit lower than in the U.S.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser ","And just I hand over to Peter, so couple of things just around our pension, your comment about negotiations or in the UK it's probably just in the context of UK has a different format where large companies have trustees. And so Mike and his team do work with the trustees to essentially plan for fulfillment of our obligations under the pension plans in the UK and the UK trustees have their own specific responsibilities with regard to being a guardian of the UK pension plans. ","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","So is it fair to say that in the UK it's not driven quite as much by the numbers that we tend to focus on here in the U.S.?","Daniel S. Glaser ","I think in the UK certainly the same sorts of issues, in terms of what's the discount rate, what's the market return, what's the return on planned assets, what is the allocation between different categories of asset classes, mortality are all similar factors. The one difference is in the UK there is an independent group of trustees who take their own view and have their own advice in terms of what all of those variables mean and taken together. UK also has different types of rules and regulations and a different measurement system where we clearly as a company look at our plans on a GAAP basis, around the world where we have DB plans. And in the UK they look not only at a GAAP basis but also on a what they call technical provision basis. ","J. Michael Bischoff","","So Dan let me just add one other thing is Larry as you can see it's extremely complex looking at the plans not only in the U.S. and the UK but I have to say we have fantastic advisors, teams on both sides of the Atlantic working with this literally almost on a daily basis and I am pleased to report these teams are part of Mercer. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Okay turning to the agency I would just like to start by saying now this has been a consistent strategy over really a five year period that we started truly executing about four years ago. So we will ultimately really reap the benefit of the agency strategy and I just think hats off to Peter and his team because the reality is in the early stages as we build out platform hub, and because we eat all of the deal cost and amortization and all of that it actually hurts Marsh\u2019s overall NOI and the segment NOI on a margin basis. ","Clearly someday when we reduce the level of amortization, which is still some years off then it will be a big help forever more, but this is a clear strategy that the management team has been executing for a number of years and so, Peter?","Peter Zaffino","","Thanks Dan and as you said it\u2019s been a journey. We have acquired 35 agencies since 2009 and our annualized revenue is approaching approximately $600 million. As Dan had mentioned in his opening comments we\u2019re really excited about the acquisition of Barney & Barney which is going to be MMA\u2019s western region hub, so we have a much more of a balanced national platform now. We also made two other acquisitions in January so the momentum is quite strong. ","Very pleased with the organic growth, certainly in line of what our expectations are, in line with other middle market brokers within the U.S. and believe that we\u2019re building a platform that is going to be the premier agency in the United States over time. So we\u2019re going to stick to the strategy of attracting high quality agencies and believe that the pipeline is strong and very optimistic of the future. ","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Do you have all your hubs in place now?","Peter Zaffino","We don't have, Larry a prescription of how many hubs we want for the national platform. I would expect us to do a couple of other acquisitions for hubs but again our geographical footprint is getting to be quite strong. So the geographic areas where we want to expand is really in a couple parts of the U.S. So I think we will do couple more hubs but again no rush. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","","And the watch word for this is not really geography it's quality, so where there are quality agencies in the United States regardless of size we are interested in acquiring quality.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great, thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser","","Next question please.","Operator","Jay Gelb, Barclays.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thank you. For the risk and insurance services segment you mentioned that Guy Carpenter growth could be somewhat slower but I am wondering if Marsh kind of continued to grow faster even though primary pricing, reinsurance pricing facing headwinds the economy is certainly recovering so does that net out to 3% or better going forward.","Daniel S. Glaser","","Yeah when we are looking at the RIS segment in total we certainly we have been in a world of 3% to 5% over the last several years and we think we still live in that world, notwithstanding the headwind that Guy Carpenter is facing.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Thanks, Dan. And I believe in the past you said within that range RIS margin expansion?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, that's really right. ","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, can you give us a bit more color on the underlying expense growth? I think 1% underlying growth is a pretty impressive achievement. How are you able to keep it there and that 1% maybe for the overall company, right?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yeah the 1% is for the overall company. In the fourth quarter RIS grew expenses 3% and consulting grew expenses 2%, corporate was minus 4% in the quarter. When we look at it obviously there is a lot going on under the hood. So our level of expenses is benefited by prior year actions in terms of capturing efficiency and rolling forward actions that we have already done. ","The short answer is that we are spending a fair amount of money, not only on colleagues but on investing for future growth and on operational improvements. The good news is you know our search for efficiencies doesn't end. And each year we've been able to find significant areas in which we could improve the underlying performance of the company and it actually maxed our overall level of expense growth because generally when we are finding those efficiencies we are letting them roll through. ","To give you a couple of ideas we significantly reduced our real estate footprint over the past five years and we used stakes a lot better than we ever had before. Another item is that we've increased the headcount in our own service center in India by over 600 people since January of 2011. ","We've centralized procurement which obviously influences demand management but also gives us spend leverage. So I could go on and on there are literally dozens of items that we've done to attack all other operating expenses. And all you have to do is look at our compensation and benefits which is the leading driver of expense and our comp and ben as a percentage of revenue we finished the year at 58.8% which is stable to what it has been in the past. ","And so we're letting comp and ben flow through our colleagues and within our improvements in profitability I am very proud of the fact that we've had five consecutive years of increases to the total bonus pool. ","J. Michael Bischoff","So let me just add to what Dan said you can see that we're putting a lot of investments in the business, we are putting a lot of CapEx, we're putting a lot of money in analytics. But the other side of that is that we've a goal as a management team to make MMC a great place to work. And so as a result of that we are not going to get the profit improvement on the backs of our colleagues. ","As Dan said compensation is a great degree year-after-year-after-year. We're looking at other things that can make the environment more attractive for our colleagues. Even in the space reduction on real estate that Dan alluded to our global real estate teams say it's not just an issue of densification because you can fit more people into square footage business but you end up with a not as hospitable work environment. ","So we've adopted a smart office concept where we look at the needs and motivational surveys with regard to our staff to make the environment that they work in much more conducive to their life styles and work styles. So overall it's a combination of not only investing in the business but making MMC a great place for our colleagues as well. ","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","I see okay. And then just switching gears, health exchange revenues for contracts signed this year all come in 2014, correct? ","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","They will come on as the continuation of payments come on. So we recognize it throughout the year with no big bubble effect in any one quarter. ","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. But that would all be organic growth additionally in 2014, correct?","Julio A. Portalatin","","Well, keeping in mind that we have sold to clients that were both with us or with Mercer and we sold to some clients that are new to Mercer. All those clients that we've sold that were already HMB clients and Mercer clients, we do have an expansion average revenue because we are selling voluntary and ancillary products, so we do get that uplift. And then those are new-new of course you get back. So it's not all new-new coming into Mercer. ","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Okay. Next question, please. ","Operator","Meyer Shields, KBW. ","Meyer Shields - KBW","","Thanks, good morning. ","Daniel S. Glaser ","Hi, good morning, Meyer. ","Meyer Shields - KBW","I guess I keep on hearing these reports of slowing economic growth in some emerging markets. Is that something that could temper organic growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America next year?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Well, we read the same reports and clearly there is issues in the emerging markets you really have to look at country by country. It's not that the emerging market is some monolithic area that all has the same characteristics. In certain of the countries the issues are regulatory or anti-business practices, in other countries there is this political elections. I think in a number of countries in the emerging world there are elections within the next 12 months and that has created some level of activity and commentary. ","Clearly when we look at our businesses the emerging market is very important to us in all four of our OpCos but no more so than in Marsh and Mercer. Having said that if you look at just the size of our company and where we get our revenue from, tell me how we're doing in the U.S. and the UK, Australia, Canada, Germany and France and I put those countries together and I'll tell you how we did as a firm. ","And so the emerging market it is largely can be additive to us. The great thing about the emerging market is that you get not only the activity in the marketplace from a exposure growth standpoint, there's some mild level in certain of the countries and higher than mild in other countries of inflation. And so you get the benefits of GDP growth albeit that GDP growth in certain places may be slowing. ","But you also get the benefit of increased penetration, not only of insurance but also for advisory services, that impacts Oliver Wyman and Mercer and Guy Carpenter as well. And so when we look at the emerging market it can clearly have an impact on us from a growth standpoint but we're not overly concerned with it. ","We have been able to grow through good times and bad in our footprint around the world. There is a lot less competition in some of the countries in terms of having the capability that a company like Marsh & McLennan has in some parts of the emerging world. And so there is a series of puts and takes but overall we're not overly concerned. ","Mike brought out in his commentary earlier how for the first time in a real long time the emerging market's weakness against the dollar could have an impact on us this year. So thankfully we've got some tailwinds on pension that will offset that potential weakness in foreign exchange. ","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. Thank you, that's very helpful. And if I can change topic briefly, if I look anecdotally at the deals announced by some of the acquisitive brokers in established markets, there seemed to be may be an above average number of brokerages the size of Barney & Barney that are for sale. Is that a legitimate observation and is that likely to benefit MMA as an acquirer of hubs or may be additional hubs in current areas? ","Daniel S. Glaser ","I'll take that initially and then I'll hand over to Peter to give some more comments. If you look at all of the major brokers really there are products of acquisitions over a long period of time and certainly when you look at Marsh & McLennan Company, all the way back to Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan who came together and formed Marsh & McLennan we have proven to be a very good acquirer over a long period of time.","And there is periods of time either through concerns about regulation path, compliance et cetera and there also generational periods of time where certain agencies come up in different parts of the world. I think clearly what we have done is built the company not a franchise but a company in Marsh & McLennan Company which is attractive as a buyer. ","And so we don't jump into processes and buy something we cultivate relationships over the long periods of times and when we look at acquisitions whether it's in risk and return services segment or any other segment the first thing that we're thinking about is how does it make us better, how does it give us capability that we don\u2019t currently possess what does it give us in terms of either geography or segment that we don't currently have. ","And so that's our thought process and then after that it's very much in terms of -- their chemistry between the teams and is there a cultural fit. The terms and conditions are largely an after thought of when everything else slots into place. But Peter do you have any other views here? ","Peter Zaffino","That was very comprehensive and so I would just add that many of the acquisitions that we have made, the agencies have not been for sale. It's just really cultivating relationships over a period of time and making sure that they're aligned with the strategic intent of what we're trying to build. So I will keep that in mind. I mean our pipeline is strong as I mentioned before but as Dan mentioned it's really cultivating the relationships and we've been doing that over several years. ","So I haven't seen any more activity in terms of access for sale than we have over a period of time. I think we've been doing a much better job of proactively working with potential acquired assets and it has worked out quite well.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, fantastic. That was very helpful.","Daniel S. Glaser","","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ","Hi, good morning. I was hoping that we could talk more about what you guys are seeing in terms of the economic conditions within the U.S. in particular any changes with exposure changes and how that impacted the organic revenue growth that did pickup in the quarter? And also just in terms of what your expectations are for the U.S. in 2014 as well?","Daniel S. Glaser","","Okay so I will take the first part of that and then I will hand off to Scott McDonald to just talk about macro issues little bit in the U.S. and even in other parts of the world, if we might expand that out. ","So economic conditions are clearly an impact because they drive exposure whether it\u2019s in really in all four of our operating companies, you take Marsh clearly areas around construction or economic activity drive some of the values that are used as the exposure base. Payrolls could be rising, which certainly impacts workers comp as well as Mercer. ","So when we look at GDP overall we have been bouncing along the bottom and have been well we have been in a phase which we call the grinded out years which is essentially low levels of GDP growth in the developed world including the United States and a cautiousness around expansion that we believe in a lot of ways still exists and so clearly something that may have been a light headwind might be a light tailwind but it\u2019s certainly not buoyant out there and there is still lot of concerns throughout the market and so an awful lot of companies have cash on the balance sheet which they are not putting to work. ","Having said all of that exposure units is just one of several factors that drive out our performance. I mean whether our revenue retention and account retention, very important, new business, as you mentioned GDP growth also interest rates also P&C types of pricing and so there is a number of factors that drive our performance and the exposure units are just one of them. Scott you want to give us a little bit more flavor from Oliver Wyman\u2019s perspective?","Scott McDonald","","Sure. Oliver Wyman tends to be or at least our pipeline tends to be a pretty good indicator of the economy and based on what we see across clients, across sectors and region what we are looking at for 2014 is continued growth and activity in the U.S. I think this is supported by the really strong bounce back we had in Q4 with our U.S. business and that was pretty consistent across industries. ","We see continued stabilization in Europe and as Dan highlighted earlier some increased volatility in developed markets, driven by a number of things, including the tapering uncertainties around Chinese growth and the many idiosyncratic things that Dan mentioned earlier. ","One point of caution on the U.S. that I'll mentioned is that much of the work we did in the second half of 2013, even as our business improved was driven by cost cutting, efficiency projects and restructuring rather than projects focused on growth initiatives and that suggests to us that many companies, particularly in the U.S. are still cautious going into 2014, they are still holding cash and we may not be in a booming period yet. ","Daniel S. Glaser","","Thank you.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC "," ","Okay, thank you, very helpful. And then just switching about to healthcare exchanges quickly following on the 2013 enrollment fee there how would you just kind of describe the growth structuring and any initial comments I guess pointing towards 2014 from some conversations that you might have already with either existing or potential new clients for your platform?","Daniel S. Glaser","","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","I will take that. Thank you. You know our pace of sales continues giving -- and given our significant reach in both the mid-market and the large accounts we are seeing conversations beyond just traditional calendar year and that pace of conversations continues to increase. Since our last update as an example on client accounts and lives we have sold additional clients on the Mercer place. To give you an idea our last update I think was in our October call when we spoke about 220,000 lives. We are up to 270,000 lives now, that includes retirees as well as active across 64 companies. ","And we are pleased -- we are really pleased with the progress. I think you will see that -- that will continue to be the case, pipeline looks strong. We will continue to have good concentrated discussions as to timing with our clients. We want to make sure we balance that well to their needs and we are seeing some really good uplift. When everything is said and done we have always said and always been very clear that the impact on revenue in 2014 will be modest but over a long period of time we see this as being something that is going to really help and our ability to grow and to satisfy our client needs. ","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ","Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you very much. Next question, please. ","Operator","Jay Cohen, Bank of America. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay.","Jay Adam Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Good morning. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Good morning. ","Jay Adam Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Couple of questions. Barney & Barney you talked about the revenue that they had. Is there any seasonality there as we model this, we assume that comes in fairly evenly over the course of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. I am not much sure if we have that level of depth in that -- in this room on that. I mean we are talking about a $100 million as part of $12.3 billion, so I am not sure it would be that impactful either way but do you have any flavor. ","J. Michael Bischoff","","I think it's fairly even but I'd like to caution that we haven't delved into the details of each quarter but I think it is -- there is no real seasonality from what we hear today. ","Daniel S. Glaser","And Marsh's quarterization is very interesting. You have got really three quarters which have about 26% in the third quarter which is their shortest quarter, is 23%. So it's really even throughout the whole year quarter-by-quarter except for the third quarter. ","Jay Adam Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, okay. The other question was on corporate expenses, were kind of well below the run rate from the first three quarters of the year. Is this a new level that we should think about or should we think about more kind of full year numbers as we base -- as we look at 2014?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Well it is true that for the year corporate expenses are 8% lower than the prior year. That was driven largely by efficiency and also because we eliminated the Group President position. Mike, you want to give that some more flavor? ","J. Michael Bischoff ","And for very good reason. Yeah thanks, Dan, thank Jay. So corporate quarterly expenses Jay can move around quarter-to-quarter. So you are really asking what is an appropriate run rate for the year. I would take our corporate expenses overall not much differently in 2014 than 2013. So you could be looking at roughly $44 million to $45 million a quarter. I would say that's the part that you see, there is larger part on shared services that's allocated to the operating companies and speaking to what Dan alluded to earlier our drive for efficiency to continue to find ways to reduce cost, we will continue to do that. ","But with regard to corporate expenses in the neighborhood of a $175 million to $180 million for the year is probably good for modeling purposes. Thanks. ","Jay Adam Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks a lot. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks. I think we have time for one or two more questions, so next question please operator. ","Operator","Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS ","Yeah, good morning. I'll be quick here. Mike I am wondering if you could just chat a little bit about cash usage as you look into 2014 particularly with savings from the pension. Should we expect an increase in CapEx that's going to go to share buyback, acquisitions kind of what is your thoughts there?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff ","Okay. Thank you, Dan. Thanks, Brian and good morning. So that -- upgrade because we are in a position of having an enormous amount of operating cash flow, lot of questions with regard to cash utilization, capital structure, where is this balanced and where do we seem to direct it and we really can't wait for you to have come and hear in more depth at Investor Day on March 11. How is that? ","Brian Meredith - UBS ","Thanks. ","J. Michael Bischoff ","All the secrets of the temple will be revealed on March 11. ","Brian Meredith - UBS ","All right. The second question just quickly I am curious ","Brian Meredith - UBS","All right. We will be waiting. Second question just quickly I am curious you've kind of provided with your thoughts on commercial lines pricing on a global basis with some of your recent releases. Is it possible to kind of parse that out as far as what you are seeing at Marsh Agency versus kind of the global basis there is kind of different commercial lines of pricing dynamics going on in that business? ","Daniel S. Glaser","So we don't have Peter address that a bit and then if I move it over to Alexander Moczarski and he talk from a reinsurance perspective. And I only say that because after 30 years in the business often times what you see in reinsurance you end up seeing in the primary market within 12 months or so. And so Peter why don't we start with you? ","Peter Zaffino","Okay. As a macro overview we've seen slight headwinds in the international and modest benefit in the U.S. If you break that down into agency that would be consistent -- they've seen a modest tailwind. But one line of business that seems to still be receiving rate increase every quarter has been worker's compensation. So that is the one that has the same result. ","So and then some segments within professional liabilities. So agency had a mild benefit in the quarter and in the year. ","Brian Meredith - UBS","Okay. Thanks. ","Alexander S. Moczarski ","Okay. So probably we've been talking about capital coming into the cash base, so $40 billion that are either tied back to your pension capital, tied together with stronger balance sheet of reinsurance companies as the economies improve, tied together with centralized buying. All indication are that on the prices -- getting establish throughout that are upwards, we've seen that as a result of the cat pressure the reinsurers have become more flexible on the offerings that they're providing around other lines of business they sort of overlap. ","So it would indicate that there is no pressure to push prices up at this moment. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. I think we have time for one more question please. ","Operator","Paul Newsome Sandler O'Neil. ","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","Thank you. And congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick one. On the exchanges does the announcements that allow these insurance companies are going to lose money on their exchanges impact your position in that business in anyway?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yeah, there is -- one thing that you can count on is there is going to continue to be evolving changes that how ACA is going to impact both our clients and carriers. And that's why I think anyone thing is difficult to point to as far as where the impact is going to be. As an example we all know that just announced that there is going to be some changes to the mandate for medium size companies 15 to 99 employees will have the next year now through 16 while large companies 99 plus will have to also coverage up to 70% of the employees instead of 95 which was prior to that. And that's continuing to change. ","So when you think about carriers that was always an assessment that was made earlier on as far as what carrier rate should be on exchanges, on public exchanges we're talking about now as opposed to private exchanges, much difference, two different sets of discussions, on the public exchanges and the assumption that you would get an adequate distribution of risk and that distribution of risk has not materialized. So whether or not it was in public exchange or just regulatory medical when distribution of risk has not materialized yet to review your rate levels you have to make decisions as what the right rates will be next year.","And so the impact will be what it is, whatever that impact is as a result of those changes distributions between expected and reality. ","Daniel S. Glaser","So I think just to some it up the core point is there is a huge difference between public and private exchanges in the Mercer marketplace which is a private exchange carrier and know who their customers are going to be and can rate them appropriately and so the private -- a lot of the things that you are reading from insurance companies losing money on exchanges is their comments with regard to the public exchanges. ","Julio A. Portalatin","That's right. And then if I just can add one more thing also on the private exchanges keep in mind the Mercer marketplace in particular offers both a fully insured and self-insured option which means it's wide open for people to consider private exchange Mercer marketplace as an option. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Does that answer your question, Paul? ","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.","It did indeed, thank you. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Thank you. Okay. So I would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day which will be held on March 11th as Mike mentioned at the Pierre Hotel in New York. We will provide more insight into MMC's growth and financial strategies, including presentations from the CEOs of each operating company.","Finally I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"14268":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Please go ahead.","Dan Glaser","Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. ","Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.","We are pleased with our second quarter results, which include JLT for the first time. Since we closed the acquisition on April 1, we are often running with our leadership in place and our teams in formation, working together to serve clients with greater expertise, capabilities and content. ","We have more conviction than ever that the acquisition better positions us to help our clients with their greatest challenges. JLTs impressive talent has added to our thought leadership and ability to innovate. We\u2019ve added about 10,000 colleagues to the organization, resulting in the broadest and deepest talent base in the industry. JLT has made us stronger in several specialty areas and has deepened our footprint in the faster growing geographies of Asia Pacific and Latin America, and JLT has enhanced ours scale. ","In the second quarter we grew total revenue by 16%, and RIS revenue by 23% compared to a year ago, despite a meaningful FX drag. This is a huge leap forward for our firm. ","Scale is becoming increasingly important and this combination extends our position, as the leading firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. However as I said last quarter, size and scale aren\u2019t everything; quality, capability and responsiveness of what really mattered to clients, and on max score we deliver world class service one client at a time. ","We\u2019ve been hard at work on this integration since the day we announced the transaction, and post-closing we shifted aggressively from planning to execution. Mark will update you on some of our guidance items, but broadly speaking, things are tracking well with our expectations. ","We moved quickly to integrate our financial reporting and from the first month after closing, began viewing our results on a combined basis throughout the firm. We are beginning to realize efficiencies and are meeting our milestones in terms of cost savings. ","We are acting swiftly to integrate our teams and shared facilities around the world. We\u2019ve already moved and co-located 5,000 of our colleagues in several cities, including London, Hong Kong, Sydney and Johannesburg. By the end of 2019, we will have nearly all colleagues around the world sitting side-by-side in their respective areas of operation. This involves a movement of 10,000 colleagues in 80 offices. ","Integrating our teams in this way is significant, because it enables our colleagues to come together for clients and coalesce into a single team. We have spent a lot of time understanding the respective cultures of JLT and MMC and are focused on bringing them together in a shared, more powerful firm.","Our complementary strengths offer revenue growth potential, which we believe should enhance our long term growth profile. While these are early days and we\u2019re not yet operating as a single team in all markets or lines of business, I still wouldn\u2019t want to compete against them. ","We have already seen several examples where joint collaboration and the best content and solutions helped us to expand existing relationships and win new business. For example, our Marsh colleagues in Europe won business by presenting our combined capabilities to a client with a complex set of risks that required a combination of multinational expertise, specialty coverage, risk consulting and captive support. ","In the U.S. Marsh successfully retained and expanded the business of a large financial institution. By leveraging Marsh\u2019s existing relationships and Marsh JLT specialty analytics, expertise and innovative solutions, the team added coverage\u2019s for cyber and other specialty lines. ","In Australia where we have an $800 million business with nearly 4,000 colleagues, clients and prospects are reacting positively to the expanded capabilities of the combined organization. We retained two important risk clients by demonstrating the depth of talent and the benefits of the new value proposition, and we were able to extend our position to include Mercer. ","Guy Carpenter recently won an RFP for a top 10 U.S. insurer by leveraging a terror model developed by JLT Re, combined with the analytical capabilities of Guy Carpenter. Mercer Marsh benefits enhanced by the addition of JLT partnered on Britain\u2019s Healthiest Workplace Launch taking the largest survey of its kind in the U.K. to clients. We also see potential in the medium term to improve reliability and efficiency by leveraging JLTs shared services operations in India. JLT adds 1,700 colleagues in India for Marsh & McLennan.","In summary, we were off to a good start. The value creation that will be generated by the combined company is significant and we are excited about our future together. ","Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming in specific lines and geographies, especially for complex risk or those with CAT exposure. The Marsh global insurance market index saw an increase of nearly 6% in the second quarter, compared with 3% in the first quarter and 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Property lines are seeing an average renewal price increase of 8%, with US up 10%. Casualty prices increased for the first time since 2013 and saw average renewal rate increases of 1% in the second quarter. ","Financial and professional lines saw average renewal rate increases of 10% in the quarter, with the U.S. up 7% and U.K. and Asia Pacific up double digits. Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risks and we generally see less movement in the middle market. ","Turning to reinsurance, at the mid-year 2019 renewals which primarily focuses on U.S. hurricane exposed programs, multiple factors came together to result in double digit property catastrophe rate increases in Florida on average for the first time in over a decade. This was driven by loss creep from the 2017 and 2018 loss events, reduced capital inflows and involving views of risk. Ultimately we can\u2019t predict the mid to long term outlook for pricing, but the current conditions are firmer almost across the board. ","Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We delivered solid combined results in the quarter, with underlying revenue growth across both risk and insurance services and consulting. We are executing well, both delivering for clients while working through the integration of JLT. ","Consolidated revenue was $4.3 billion, up 16% or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 19% to $894 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $1.18. ","In risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, an increase of 23%. Underlying revenue growth was 3% in the quarter, reflecting 4% growth in Marsh, despite a tough comparison to a year ago, partially offset by a decline at Guy Carpenter. ","The declining in Guy Carpenter\u2019s underlying revenue growth is a combination of timing and a decline in our new business pipeline. Not surprising for an acquisition of this size, JLTs new business slowed considerably during the period between deal announcement and closing. This impacted Marsh and Guy Carpenter, but was felt more acutely in reinsurance. ","Although it will take time to rebuild the new business pipeline, we are confident in the long term growth outlook for our combined business. RIS adjusted operating income increased 21% to $641 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points versus a year ago. ","In consulting, second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion up 9% compared with a year ago. Underlying revenue was up 5% for the quarter, driven by strong underlying growth at Oliver Wyman of 13%, while Mercer generated 2% underlying revenue growth. Consulting adjusted operating income grew 14% and the adjusted margin expanded 130 basis points versus a year ago. ","In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results and our progress integrating the JLT acquisition. At a high level, we are tracking success in this period across three primary dimensions: growth, achievement of cost savings and retention of key talent and across each of these categories we are satisfied with our performance to-date.","For 2019 we expect a solid first year as a combined company, underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. ","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our second quarter results represent a solid first quarter following the close of the JLT acquisition. Overall revenue grew 16% to $4.3 billion due to the addition of JLT beginning on April 1 and solid underlying growth of 4%. Note that underlying revenue growth in all of our communications and disclosers includes JLT. ","Operating income in the quarter was $680 million, while adjusted operating income increased 19% to $894 million. Overall our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points in the quarter with significant margin expansion in both segments. GAAP EPS was $0.65 in the quarter; adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.18. ","For the first six months of 2019, underlying revenue growth was 4%, our adjusted operating income grew 14% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $2.70. Overall, our adjusted margin increased 160 basis points to 24.4% for the first half of 2019. ","In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue grew 23% to $2.6 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Operating income increased 10% to $517 million. Adjusted operating income increased 21% to $641 million and the adjusted margin increased 80 basis points to 27.8%. For the first six months of the year revenue was $5 billion, underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 13%. ","At March, revenue in the quarter was $2.2 billion with underlying growth of 4%, representing a solid first quarter with JLT, especially considering the tough comparison to a strong second quarter last year. U.S. and Canada continued its trend of strong growth with 5% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter that U.S. and Canada has delivered 5% or higher underlying growth. ","In international, underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 7%, Latin America up 4% and EMEA flat. For the first six months revenue in Marsh was $3.9 billion with underlying growth of 4%. U.S. and Canada was up 5%, while international grew 3%. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $392 million in the quarter with an underlying declined of 3%. ","As Dan mentioned, the softness in the quarter was due to some quarterly variability, as well as a decrease in new business. For the first six months of the year revenue was $1.1 billion with 2% underlying grow. We are confident in Guy Carpenter\u2019s long term growth outlook, but expect current trends will impact revenue growth for the balance of 2019. ","Guy Carpenter is executing its integration and cost savings plans, which will help them deliver solid earnings growth in 2019. ","In the consulting segment revenue in the quarter was up 9% to $1.8 billion, underlying growth of 5%. Operating income increased 4% to $278 million. Adjusted operating income increased 14% to $305 million and the adjusted margin increased 130 basis points to 18%. ","Consulting\u2019s underlying revenue growth for the first six months of 2019 was 4%, with consolidated revenue of $3.5 billion. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 16% to $596 million. ","Mercer\u2019s revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth underlying growth was flat with mid-single digit growth in investment management offset by a low single digit decline in our defined benefit business. ","Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth, with assets under management increasing to $283 billion, benefiting from continued inflows, market appreciation and assets from JLT. ","Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter and Career underlying growth was strong at 6%. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.4 billion with 1% underlying growth. ","Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue was $540 million in the quarter with impressive underlying growth of 13%. Growth was broad based by practice and geography. For the first six month of the year revenue was $1.1 billion with 10% underlying growth. ","Turning to corporate expenses, adjusted corporate expense was $52 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $50 million per quarter for the remainder of this year. ","We are just over 100 days post the closing of JLT and are moving forward rapidly with the integration. We continue to expect the transaction will be modestly diluted to adjusted EPS in the first year, break even in year two and to be accretive in year three. ","At this point we expect at least $250 million of run rate cost savings and $375 million or more of costs associated with achieving these savings. Of the $250 million of cost savings, we expect to realize roughly $75 million in 2019, $175 million at 2020 and the full $250 million in year three. In terms of the $375 million of costs to achieve these savings, we expect to incur roughly half in 2019 with the remainder incurred evenly over the next two years. ","During the second quarter we incurred $141 million of interest expense, and continue to expect around $140 million in the third quarter, consistent with our previous guidance. ","As disclosed in our supplemental materials released on June 6, we now expect annual deal related amortization from the JLT transaction to be $180 million pretax. In the second quarter, we recorded $100 million of amortization, which includes the JLT related amortization, as well as amortization from other transactions. ","Approximately $80 million of the $100 million was recorded in RIS and $20 million in consulting. We currently expect the third quarter amortization will be roughly consistent with the level in the second quarter.","In aggregate, the financial impact of the JLT transaction is tracking well with our initial expectations. In the second quarter we reported $280 million of noteworthy item, mostly related to the JLT acquisition. Included in the total, are $98 million of integration costs, the largest category of which is severance; $150 million of charges associated with the closing and the refinancing of JLT debt, and $26 million of other restructuring costs mainly related to Mercer. ","Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis we had $6 million of investment income in the quarter, and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2019 will be immaterial. ","On a GAAP basis investment income was $8 million [ph] in the quarter. Foreign exchange was at roughly $0.02 per share headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect $0.01 per share of FX headwinds in each of the third and fourth quarters. ","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25.9% compared with 25.2% in the second quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.1% compared with 24.3% last year. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect the tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding discreet items. ","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $13.1 billion or $12.6 billion excluding commercial paper. During the quarter we refinanced the remaining $550 million of senior notes assumed from JLT, using mix of cash and additional $300 million one year term loan. ","Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 when $300 million of senior notes will mature. At this point our expectation is that we will retire these notes with cash-on-hand, in line with our planed deleveraging over the next couple of years. ","In the second quarter we repurchased 1 million shares of our stock for $100 million. We continue to expect to repurchase enough shares in 2019 to reduce our shift. ","Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.3 billion. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $6.1 billion and included $5.8 billion for acquisition, $212 million for dividend and $100 million for sharing repurchase. ","For the first six months uses of cash totaled $6.6 billion and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $422 million for dividends and $100 million for share repurchase. In May our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $41.05 to $45.05 per share an increase of 10%. ","Overall we expect 2019 to be a solid first year with JLT. We are on track to achieve good underlying revenue growth, meet our integration savings targets and deliver margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS. As you think ahead to the remainder of 2019, keep in mind that JLT has heightened seasonality, as shown in the supplemental quarterly materials we released on June 6. Their first and third quarters were seasonally smaller, while their second and fourth quarters were seasonally stronger. ","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dam.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Mark. Operator, we are happy to go to the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Mike Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Michael Phillips ","Good morning. Thank you and congrats on your first quarter with the acquisition under your belt. My first question, lots of moving parts obviously with JLT. I guess could you comment on the impact of the margins in the quarter from the aviation business that you sold? ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, I mean at the end, the aerospace business that we sold would have had a very negligible impact on the margin in this quarter. The reality of that business is that\u2019s a very big fourth quarter business, but it\u2019s a much smaller throughout other parts of the year. ","Michael Phillips ","Okay, great, thanks. I guess secondly, you are still talking of kind of the long term organic growth of in the 3% to 5% range. How do we think about the impacts on your margins and how the margins can expand if you stay below 5% in that? ","Mark McGivney","So a couple of things. One, when we think long term what we said before is we have been growing in the 3% to 5% range annually for the last decade and so until we are able to break out of that range, you know you are what your results say you are and we\u2019ve been performing in that 3% to 5% range. That\u2019s not to say we view our long term growth possibilities as somehow parameter based or bucketed within that range you know. We have aspirations to grow more than that clearly. ","Now, we have proven over a long period of time that we are able to grow margins within 3% to 5%, even when we are performing at 3% growth. I mean our key to expansion is the way we run the business, where revenue growth almost always exceeds expense growth and we\u2019ve done that consistently. And so you know over a period of 12 years we are now in the 12th consecutive year of margin expansion. So I feel comfortable that this leadership team will be able to continue to grow margins by growing our revenue faster than growing our expense into the future. ","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take the next question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Elyse Greenspan ","Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the margin within RIS in the quarter. You know pretty \u2013 a lot stronger than what I had expected. So if you could just help us understand, now I know you guys gave us some financials for JLT last year and based off of that, I would have thought that that would have been a drag on your margins, because they run lower than historical RIS. ","Could you just give us a sense of what drove that? Was it you know how much phase came through in the quarter? Was it employees that potentially left after the deal closed. I\u2019m just trying to tie together you know the moving parts that drove pretty strong margin improvement within RIS? ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, sure. As we said earlier, we expected margins to expand this year for the company and we set that going into the year and that is our expectation, so this was not a big surprise to us. ","I would caution everybody as we\u2019ve done in the past, not to look at margins in any one quarter, but look over a length of time, either on a you know annual basis, rolling 12 months, etcetera, because there are puts and takes in every quarter that impact margins.","You know when we talk about \u2013 we\u2019re not going to detail individual cost savings and what\u2019s dropping to the bottom line, although you know it\u2019s fair to say that a lot of our cost saves in the $250 million or the at least $250 million will drop, because you know as you sited JLT ran their business at a lower margin than Marsh & McLennan did and our view is that we will bring the combined business to the margins of Marsh & McLennan and expand from that point in time, and that\u2019s why you are seeing some expansion now. ","Elyse Greenspan ","Okay thanks. And then my second question, you know reinsurance, Guy Carpenter declined in the quarter, you know I think both of you guys in your prepared remarks reference a lower new business pipeline or lower new business growth. If you can just expand on that, also could you give us a sense of the retention that you are seeing within both Legacy, JLT and Marsh & McLennan, just so we can get a sense of you know kind of the drag. I know you referenced you might see for the balance of, you know the balance of this year? ","Dan Glaser","Yes, so I\u2019ll take that and then I\u2019ll hand over to Peter to give us a little bit more. You know I\u2019d start by saying Guy Carpenter has been a terrific performer on multi-levels for us in many years, and in fact this negative quarter is only their second negative quarter in the last decade. You know and you cited, new business was the primary feature and so it\u2019s quite common in acquisitions. ","We even see it in much smaller acquisitions within Marsh & McLennan agency, where post acquisition there is a little bit of a low for a period of time and so its natural. And certainly from deal announcement through to closing there was a period where the pipeline was beginning to weekend. This is correctable, it\u2019s not going to take years, but then again it\u2019s not going to take weeks and so there\u2019ll be a period of time that we work it through and we\u2019ll get the pipeline going again. So it\u2019s not something that we are overly concerned with. ","And I would say the new business both for Marsh and for Guy Carpenter is vitally important. You know if you are a primary broker as an example and if you\u2019re not growing your base by 10% or 20% of new business every year, you\u2019re going to go backwards. And so you know it gives you the magnitude of the hill that we climbed successfully in my view with our RAS overall. But Peter, want to add some more color to that. ","Peter Hearn ","I think you\u2019re absolute right, Dan. I mean, you know at least the reinsurance business typically has a long duration sales cycle and when you put any uncertainty or doubt into a buyer\u2019s mind it\u2019s going to impact the business pipeline, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen from the legacy JLT business, and you know quite frankly what we\u2019re doing is we are you know bringing the legacy JLT and Guy Carpenter sales processes together. ","We\u2019ve had a very successful disciplined global sales model in Guy Carpenter, which has created you know significant results for us over the past 2.5 years and as Dan said, it\u2019s not going to happen overnight, but in the short period of time we will ingratiate the JLT business into our business pipeline and grow it successful. ","Dan Glaser","The other thing I would just add is Carpenter did a really nice job in the quarter in delivering bottom line you know and that's going to be the focus over the next couple of years. There was quite a spread between respective margins in the businesses and now our first order of business is to achieve Carpenter style margins on the combined reinsurance business. So it's a bit more for Carpenter unlike some of the other businesses. It's a bit more of a bottom line earnings focus as opposed to topline. We want both, but I'm just giving you a little bit more of the focus. ","Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brian [Inaudible]. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hey thanks. I guess just following up here on Guy Carpenter, I guess I would have expected some of the revenue disruption to come from the revenue overlap you potentially had between those two businesses and it sounds like you\u2019ve only really alluded to issues relating to new business. I was hoping Dan maybe you can give us some idea of you know, how many dis-synergies there? How much of that negative three might be stemming from that versus you know what you said on the new business side? ","A - Dan Glaser","Yeah, no it\u2019s a good. Certainly we've seen some revenue breakage, particularly in our I.S., but the magnitude of the revenue headwind for us was new business involved Marsh and Guy Carpenter. It\u2019s just this fell more acutely in this particular quarter in Guy Carpenter. ","Now we modeled a lot of revenue breakage in the deals, so you know things are tracking along with our expectation and so from that standpoint it'll be an issue that will work through over the next couple of years, but ultimately we feel we will be able to in most circumstance overcome that headwind. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, and yeah, I mean as you said we can only see it in other places other than Guy Carpenter but there\u2019s certainly also some overlap in London. If you broke out London separately, would we see something similar to the story plan on Guy Carpenter on the retail side? ","Dan Glaser","I mean London is where we have the most levels of overlap. I mean on the insurance side it\u2019s the capital of the insurance world you know, and so from that basis you would expect to see more overlap in London than you would see in other parts of the world. ","Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg ","Thank you and good morning. Dan, just you talked about pricing in the environment in property casualty. I mean without the JLT combination, do you think you would be characterizing the environment for underlying growth above you know that 3% to 5% historical range that you've been using. ","Dan Glaser","I'm going to hand it off to John and Peter a little bit, to give a little bit more pricing commentary in general. But you know the 3% to 5% is sort of where we've been for a while pre-JLT and post JLT we\u2019re saying the same thing. So I wouldn't view it as impactful on that and you know you could imagine you know from our standpoint we\u2019re focused as a combined company. There is no us and them. ","We\u2019re one organization, one set of expectations, one set of numbers as we move forward and I'm actually very proud of the organization, in being able to pull together that from the date it closed, from the first month looking at a single set of numbers, not trying to be well JLT would have been this and Marsh would have been that. It\u2019s just one set of numbers, but John, you want to talk about the pricing environment a little bit more? ","John Doyle","Sure. You know as Dan noted in his prepared comments, the market moved a bit in the quarter. Most regions and products saw increases in rate changes compared to the first quarter. ","As I said on the last call, market\u2019s more challenging for some clients than it\u2019s been you know quite some time. Dan shared the high level data. You know what I would say is our index skews a bit to large accountant and larger accounts with complex risks are the accounts that are moving the most; you know pricing, lead umbrella, property CAT, you know all high single digit range globally. The U.S. and Australia and the U.K. wholesale market are the geographies with the highest level of increases. ","But I would say that you know the SME markets, the upper middle market, you know pricing is much more muted on average in effect. It\u2019s in the low single digit range or even flat to down in some products and in some markets. ","So you know we\u2019re seeing signs of lost cost inflation and exposure shifts in certain classes; DNO, EPLI, cyber, commercial order you are seeing an increase in frequency and severity. There's some very, very big losses in the market, so. You know the industry remains very well capitalized, but some are reducing their risk appetite and moving attachment points and moving pricing. So you know that\u2019s what we see at March here. ","Peter Hearn ","You know I think as DAN said in his comments, it's very specific to lines of business and geographies in some areas of the world. Take Florida, we saw significant increases at 61 on Japanese with the exposed metric, the exposed business, there were increases, but they were all responsive based on exposure and loss. They weren\u2019t like it as we've seen in previous cycles. ","I think the other thing it's important to note to is that insurance and reinsurance pricing are sort of moving in synchronicity. It is in the top down reinsurance pricing being forced on the primary business, primary rates rising as reinsurance rights respond to the underlying growth of premiums as well. ","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Anything else Larry? ","Larry Greenberg ","Yeah Dan. I think one thing that you know investors will be struggling with and trying to tackle is just how long these headwinds, particularly at Guy Carp are going to persist? And I know it's impossible to say with precision, but would you venture some sort of time frame for you know when some sort of inflection may arise where you know that was yesterday's conversation and now we're having a new conversation about growth. ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, as you say, it is near on impossible to take something like that. What I can say is that there's no finer leadership team of this combined organization and that you know execution capability has been proven over a long period of time. ","As I mentioned before, this will not take years, but then again it won't take weeks either. This will be a period of time that we come together as one firm. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are not operating as a single team in every geography and every line of business. That is a process you know, this is real life you know and so I would say that even given that headwind that we\u2019ll have to absorb and overcome over the coming months, I would not trade strategic positioning with any other firm in our competitive space. ","We have a mountain of talent and we will be able to deliver you know very interesting solutions to clients in the future years, so the best is certainly yet to come for this organization. ","Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Great, thanks. Dan I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your comments of Guy Carpenter; you being more bottom line focused. I guess specifically what I'm trying to understand is that if the new business pipeline is down and we accept the premise and new business is typically more expensive to originally obtain, then are there some expenses that would come back as the new business pipeline rebuilds? ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, I think your basic premise there Meyer is not right. It's probably right in a lot of industries, but the reality is new business can be even more profitable. The marginal profitability is the mix account in our industry is quite high, because we're putting new revenue on existing infrastructure. We don't necessarily have to go out, hire new people, do more technology, etcetera. We can add revenue onto the existing expense base and so new business is profitable. ","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s actually very positive, thanks. And second, this is sort of unrelated to JLT, but I was hoping you could update us on the M&A environment. ","A - Dan Glaser","Well, thank you for remembering we've got other parts of the company. John, you want to talk a little bit about what's going on Marsh & McLennan Agency.","John Doyle","Sure. M&A had a strong quarter and remains quite active in the M&A market and in fact you know MMA is our priority in the near term as we integrate JLT. There is a good pipeline. You know we've earned a favorable reputation, we are broadening our commitments and you know it gives us a really good shot, in many cases the first look you know at some really high quality firms that are in the market. ","You know we closed on Bouchard in Florida in the middle of the first quarter. We closed on Lovitt & Touche in Arizona, based in Arizona on April 1. You know both were top 100 firms in the United States, high quality businesses with really, really terrific leadership so, and we have a good strong pipeline you know as we look for as well, so we're excited about the prospects there. ","A - Dan Glaser","Thanks John. Next question please. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess getting back on the Guy Carpenter wagon, I think you had already mentioned some timing issues there. Can you maybe talk about what drove that timing issues and if you expect revenues to come back in the third quarter? ","Dan Glaser","I\u2019ll start, but ultimately I would say that the new business pipeline was larger than the timing issue, although timing did have an impact, but Peter you want to talk about that? ","Peter Hearn ","Yeah, I mean you know this is an inherently volatile business and buying decisions from one quarter the next can have an impact as we\u2019ve seen. You know it probably was a function more of the market as it was buying decisions, because as the market is transitioning its taking longer and longer to price business and therefore renewals that should have happened in the second quarter are now leaning over into the third quarter.","Yaron Kinar","Okay and then as I think about the third quarter here, you know we only have one year of data for our JLT here on a quarterly basis. It seems like JLT\u2019s margins were a little weak a year ago. Is that a good run rate to use as we think of forward estimates or is there something in particular that drove margins down last year? ","Dan Glaser","Mark, you want to take that? ","Mark McGivney ","Yaron, I think if you refer back to the supplemental materials that we passed out and its why in my commentary I highlighted the seasonality. I would use 2018 as a decent baseball, and I don\u2019t think there was anything unusual in JLTs results quarter-to-quarter. And the third quarter was seasonally weak estimates. If you look back to that statement, they actually had negative NOI in the third quarter just because of the different revenue. ","Dan Glaser","Nest question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. ","Paul Newsome ","Good morning, congrats on the quarter. Just more of a follow-up here. The lag that we are seeing from that you talked about a lot, Guy Carpenter, but also seeing in Marsh, is that going to mainly come through the EMEA segment that seemed to be the segment that was a little bit slow and I guess should we essentially just think of your comments on Guy Carpenter as having \u2013 expecting similar behavior there? ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, I mean if you look at the JLT organization, you know it\u2019s almost 50% in the U.K. So rather than, you know really broad EMEA, of course the U.K. has been our EMEA, but it\u2019s pretty focused on the U.K. more than any other factors as being; that\u2019s where most of the yield overlaps occur, that\u2019s were a lot of the flow goes into the London market replacement. But overall when we look at the geographies, it\u2019s business as usual in places like Asia Pacific and we\u2019re just you know continuing very rapidly to integrate the teams and work with clients and prospects. ","And so you know, I want to make it clear that any of the revenue headwind that we have faced was completely anticipated and if you go back to when we first made the deal announcement in the last quarter we spoke about, there\u2019ll be a period of choppiness you know and delivering a 4% level of growth for the company, you know in that period of choppiness I view as being, very acceptable to us. ","And in fact you know the 4% growth from Marsh & McLennan in the second quarter is the first time we actually hit 4% growth in the last five years. I mean the last time was second quarter of 2014 and so there has been a period of time, so we feel we are doing pretty well in the circumstances. ","Paul Newsome ","I wouldn\u2019t disagree. Is the lag effect that you talked about in Guy Carpenter, the balance of the year similar in for the Marsh impact? ","Dan Glaser","You know it\u2019s hard to say, but I would say, the way to look at this is that the new business impact in terms of pipeline applies to both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. It was felt more acutely by Guy Carpenter partly because the size, relative sizes in quarters. ","You know the other thing that you have to know, the revenue breakage is likely to take longer due to materialize. Even though we\u2019re seeing some revenue breakage now, there\u2019ll be other revenue breakage in the future, particularly in areas like third party business as an example or clients that have a view of having multiple brokers and they had relied on JLT and Marsh or JLT and Guy Carpenter in the past. ","You know they\u2019d want to go find another broker if they want to have two brokers if they view that as part of their approach to the market. And so, you know think of it more along the lines of the new business lag will be regenerated based upon the efforts of Marsh and Guy Carpenter to recreate business pipelines, get people working together and that is very solvable and the revenue breakages is a short term to midterm phenomenon that will be a bit of a headwinds for us over the next couple of years, but we believe and even in those circumstances we will be able to grow our business in the 3% to 5% range organically as a company and deliver margin expansion. ","Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski ","Hey, good morning. In John\u2019s remarks about the P&C market, you described it as more challenging for some clients and it\u2019s been for a long time and you guys made the point that it\u2019s more a large account focused. I\u2019m curious how was that impacting Marsh\u2019s financials? I believe the large accounts faces more fee weighted rather than commission weighted. So how should we think about those dynamics? ","Dan Glaser","John, you want to give us some more detail. ","John Doyle","Sure, you know I think as the market, you know the overall market pricing dynamic has had some positive impact on the revenue growth of the company. But, as you know, most of the price increases are happening in this segment of market where we are paid largely on fees. So you know some of the business that migrates, the London market, so you know we get some wholesale left in that marketplace. ","You know I think the improved growth trajectory of Marsh over the last couple of years is also come, you know as our retention has improved and our fee business has improved as well. So we\u2019re getting a little bit less from the market for sure, but I think we\u2019re getting better as well.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Okay question, I guess a follow-up. ","Mike Zaremski ","Yeah, one follow-up on cyber. Could you comment if whether you\u2019d help us understand the size or maybe the growth dynamics going on with your cyber consulting business. We all know that cyber is growing a lot on the insurance side and I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s also growth coming from perhaps a cyber-consulting business that you have? Thanks. ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, sure. So let me speak broadly for a second. As you mentioned cyber is a significant growth areas, viewed as one of the primary risk for almost all companies today regardless of where you\u2019re located anywhere in the world and regardless of your size. You know everyone concerned with cyber, and certainly within our risk and insurance services business it\u2019s one of our fastest growing practices and has been over the last several years and that to me is the road without end in terms of, you know there will be as the IoT and globalization continues and the technological advances and the pace of technological advance just continues to accelerate, we will see more and more risk exposure and risk awareness around that level of connectivity, and certainly Marsh and Guy Carpenter will be very helpful. ","Turning to your question on consultants, I\u2019ll hand over to Scott McDonald, first at Oliver Wyman to address it, but Scott. ","Scott McDonald","Yeah Mike, the business as you suspected I think is growing pretty rapidly on the consulting side as well. And there our advisory element of it, governance elements, technology pieces and that\u2019s being thought I\u2019d say by the boards, by the C-suites and by others on the management team. ","So it\u2019s a very rapidly growing space, has been rapidly growing for the last few years, although it\u2019s still relatively small for us; one of our fastest growing businesses. ","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Brian Meredith ","Yeah, thanks. Just sticking with Oliver Wyman, I\u2019m just curious the comps get little bit tougher second half of the year. Should we be expecting the same type of growth continuing in Oliver Wyman or should \u2013 big projects something happen in the quarter. ","Dan Glaser","Brian, from your lips to God\u2019s ears. I mean at the end \u2013 as we said many times before you know Oliver Wyman over like the last five years has been our fastest growing operating company on a CAGR basis, but it also has the most volatility. ","And so I think you have to look at a longer term period of time in order to evaluate their growth, in mid to high single digit is where they tend to grow over long stretches of time, but Scott you wanted to price me to the up-side or the...","Scott McDonald ","Yeah, Dan covered most of it, but Brian I really appreciate the question as well. I was wondering what we had to deliver at Oliver Wyman, any other question. I like getting one. I mean we had a really good quarter which we are happy with. The interesting thing is that that strong right across the portfolio across almost all the industrial segment and across all of the regions, perhaps with the exception of Europe which has been slower.","The economy still feels okay out there. I mean employment is good, but there is some slowing growth now in pocket in the world. There is some slowing business temperament and while we see our clients still interested in doing things around growth, technology, managing disruption, they continue to get more nervous. ","So we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that gets immediately tougher. But if you look at the results over the last few years, you know as Dan highlighted, we do fall up and down depending on where we put big projects and programs into the quarters. And I think this is pop-up so I wouldn\u2019t expect it to continue at that level and the comp from last year is high.","Brian Meredith ","Thanks, so just a quick one on JLT. In the expense saves guidance that you guys have provided, have you contemplated any type of retention, you know bonuses to try to keep producers from JLT or the combined organization, was there any impact to the quarter at all from retention bonuses? ","Dan Glaser","Sure. So yeah, we clearly put into place a retention program for the combined company. You know at it includes people who are critical to our future, whether they work for JLT or whether they work from Marsh & McLennan. Obviously those were a little bit weighted towards JLT, because we wanted to you know have people give it a real chance. ","The program as you would expect is a multiyear program, and so it\u2019s really more like a three year cliff-based retention program and we \u2013 it is in our deal model, we put a significant amount of \u2013 there is no significant impact in any quarter, you know since it\u2019s over a three year period. And I would just say you know, that program is not viewed in our way as part of the cost saving program; that is more a securing the organization, securing future growth. ","You know yeah, I do want to say that because I know that a couple of you have had mentioned in the past that you\u2019ve been reading about some level of staff departures from JLT etcetera and \u2013 as I said in my script, we\u2019re evaluating the acquisition across three dimensions, really broadly on growth. So growth in power and capabilities, revenues, earnings, etcetera, expense savings clearly and also talent retention and we are satisfied across all three. Specifically on talent retention, sure there\u2019s some people who have left who we would have preferred that they stayed with the organization. ","However you got to put that in context, the overall level of JLT voluntary turnover in the second quarter of 2019 is very consistent with the overall level of voluntary turnover within JLT in the second quarter of 2018 you know and so it\u2019s running a little bit higher in the U.K. and it\u2019s actually running lower than last year in the rest of the world. So in the context of talent retention, broadly we are quite satisfied.","Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Styblo","Hi, good morning, thanks for the questions. I just wanted to circle back at a broader view of the just the JLT financial impact that you guys compare. How things have progressed since you initially provided the EPS accretion solution over the three year time frame. The supplement that you provided, not too long ago give us an insight about the amortization being a little bit better and then the aerospace sale with the bad guy, but still seems like that was not good.","I\u2019m wondering if you could share any other details about moving parts that have been positive or negative, just because as we clean those financials it seems line net-net things are a little bit better than originally expected from a pro forma standpoint. ","Dan Glaser","Yeah, let me headed over to Mark in a second, but you know there\u2019s always going to be some puts and takes as you did into a business and you create a unique new company in combination. And so there are several things that have met with our expectations along with our original planning and a few which we are doing a bit better with. But Mark you want to add more to that?","Mark McGivney","Dave, I think what Dan said is right. It actually is \u2013 I t\u2019s pretty remarkable if you go back to what we talked about last September and see how closely things are tracking in the aggregate. As I said earlier, at a high level we\u2019re tracking very closely to the initial expectations. ","There\u2019s been a lot of puts and takes. So you know you pick up something in one category give it back in another, but when it comes to the amount of debt we issued, the interest cost that we paid on that debt, the cost savings, the amount of revenue headwind that we are facing, all of these are tracking really well and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to stick with, this guidance that we are still in this category of modern solution this year, breaking in by year two and accretive in year three and also that we are seeing the margin expansion that we said we would this year. So everything\u2019s tracking really well. ","Dan Glaser","And I\u2019m particularly psyched about, you know when you look at RIS in particular up 23% in the quarter, in the company of 16% that\u2019s a step change in growth for the overall company. And yes, we are focused on underlying growth and our ability to drive underlying growth, but every once in a while you get an opportunity to really change the trajectory of a firm and that\u2019s not about underlying. So this is about total growth for the firm where we are very pleased. Do you have a follow-up? ","Mark McGivney","I do, I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse on reinsurance, but on the other side, Canada, U.S. organic growth was a solid 5%, especially against the tougher comp of 8% a year ago. I guess trying to reconcile comments of just disruption from the deal and so forth. Curious what you are seeing in that business that\u2019s holding up so well, to the extent that the market pricing dynamics have any impact and sustainability of that trajectory going forward? ","Dan Glaser","Thanks, John you want to take that? ","John Doyle ","Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, we\u2019ve had a good run in the U.S. results. They have been consistently at the high end of our revenue range. You know I mentioned earlier, MMA had good strong growth, on both P&C and EHB [ph] so I was quite pleased with that. I mentioned the pricing dynamic, you know a very, very modest price increases in the MMA portfolio, so not a big driver of the outcome, but it helps a bit. ","Marsh U.S. also has very, very strong new business after you know really an outstanding new business quarter in the second quarter of 2018, so I was quite pleased there. ","Our MGA operation in U.S. Victor had a nice quarter, and our captive management business also had a strong quarter in the United States. So overall I was quite pleased with the results in the U.S. ","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.","Dan Glaser ","Thank you, operator and thanks to everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I wanted to express my gratitude to our 76,000 colleagues for the commitment and hard work that they\u2019ve shown, as well as to our clients for their support. ","We had two core priorities in the second quarter; first to provide world class service to our clients and second, to begin the successful integration of JLT and I\u2019m delighted with the progress that we\u2019ve made on both fronts. ","I\u2019ve seen firsthand how hard our colleagues have been working and the dedication they\u2019ve shown to our company.

Please go ahead.","Dan Glaser","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.","Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Unfortunately Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter is sick with the flu and cannot join us today. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.","We are pleased with our third quarter and year to-date results. We produced excellent topline growth in the quarter with underlying revenue growth across both segments and our EPS growth is tracking well with our expectation. We are generating strong results, while continuing to make progress on the JLT integration, and overall accommodation is progressing nicely.","Our clients are beginning to see the power of our combined firm and we are demonstrating that we are better positioned to help them with their greatest challenges through our enhanced talent, capabilities and geographic footprint.","We are meeting our expectations in terms of our financial target, revenue growth and colleague retention and our businesses are coming together. Co-locating our teams is a critical part of our integration, because it enables the cultures to coalesce as well as results in increased collaboration.","To-date, we moved over 8,000 colleagues and by the end of 2019 nearly all colleagues will be sitting side-by-side in their respective areas of operation globally. We've also undertaken significant work to integrate our platforms. We now have nearly all of the JLT colleagues on our HR system and have integrated financial reporting as well as our email environment.","This is possible because of the investments we've made over the years to harmonize our systems and strengthen our infrastructure. Our progress to-date makes me confident we will comfortably exceed our $250 million savings target over three years.","As we have said from the beginning, our combination with JLT is about growth and the benefits this acquisition brings to clients, colleagues and shareholders. More and more we are working as one team for our clients.","For example, colleagues from several Marsh JLT Specialty practices across multiple countries came together to provide a customized solution for a company managing a complex hydroelectric project. Through global collaboration and our augmented capabilities we handled all of the projects insurance requirement.","In Guy Carpenter, our cyber insurance team won an RFP for a large U.S. regional carrier by demonstrating the strength of the combined organization. In Indonesia, a large manufacturer had been engaging carriers directly for their EH&B services, resulting in a sub-optimized outcome for the client.","Mercer Marsh benefits, which includes former JLT colleagues reviewed the existing benefits and recommended critical changes to drive a better outcome. This resulted in new business for MMB, lower premium cost for the clients and a more optimized solution for our client's employees.","We also continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve clients across our businesses. For example, we've recently leverage our collective strength to create a compelling global value proposition for an Asia-Pacific transportation company who is upgrading their infrastructure to a sustainable modern transportation network.","We won the mandate by leveraging Marsh JLT Specialties construction and marine expertise, Oliver Wyman's transportation and public sector expertise and Guy Carpenter's risk transfer and alternative capital capability.","During the process, we also introduced MMB, who was appointed to manage the employee benefit portfolio. Overall, I am proud of our company's progress, impressed by the hard work of our colleagues and grateful for the ongoing support of our clients.","Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines. The Marsh Global Insurance Market index saw an increase of nearly 8% in the third quarter compared with 6% in the second quarter and 3% in the first.","Global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 10% and 14% respectively. Casualty rates are up 1% on average, but mixed byline with excess casualty rates rising and worker's comp down.","Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risk, which are seeing higher increases, although middle-market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies.","Turning to reinsurance in the property catastrophe market, we've seen reinsurance rate increased throughout 2019 as a function of loss activity, geography and exposure increases. Overall, we are focused on driving the best outcome for our clients. In markets like these our capabilities and expertise shine through and become even more critical.","Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth across both risk and insurance services and consulting. We were executing well, both delivering for clients while working through the integration of JLT.","Total revenue was $4 billion, up 13% or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 10% versus a year ago to $585 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 15.9%.","Adjusted earnings per share fell 1% versus a year ago to $0.77 reflecting seasonality of JLT. Year-to-date adjusted EPS increased 6% to $3.47. In risk and insurance services third quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 18%.","Underlying revenue growth was strong at 6% in the quarter. This reflects 5% growth in Marsh, and 11% at Guy Carpenter, which was held by a true-up of a multiyear contract which Mark will discuss in more.","RAS adjusted operating income increased 11% to $313 million, the adjusted operating margin was 17.4% reflecting JLT's seasonality. In consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, up 8% compared with the year ago.","Underlying revenue was up 4% for the quarter driven by underlying growth of 7% to Oliver Wyman and 3% in Mercer. Consulting adjusted operating income grew 9% and the adjusted margin expanded 50 basis points versus a year ago.","In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our progress integrating JLT. For 2019, we expect a solid first year as a combined company, underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We had excellent quarter. Overall revenue grew 13% to $4 billion reflecting the meaningful step forward JLT represents for our firm. We generate strong underlying revenue growth of 5%, with 6% in RAS, 4% in consulting.","Remember that underlying revenue growth in our communications and disclosures include JLT. Operating income in the quarter was $467 million, while adjusted operating income increased 10% to $585 million.","Overall, our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter with 16.9%, a good result given the seasonality of JLT. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.59 in the quarter and adjusted EPS with $0.77.","For the first nine months of 2019 total revenue growth was 10%, with underlying growth of 4%. Our adjusted operating income grew 13%, our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22%, and our adjusted EPS increased 6% to $3.47.","Overall, our year-to-date performance leaves us well-positioned for a solid first year with JLT. In Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 18%, $2.2 billion with underlying growth of 6%.","RAS is now produced 5% or higher underlying growth in five of the last six quarters. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $313 million, and the adjusted margin decreased 30 basis points to 17.4%.","For the first nine months of the year revenue was $7.2 billion with total revenue growth 14% and underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 12% to $1.7 billion.","At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 5% representing another strong quarter of growth. U.S. and Canada grew 6% on an underlying basis in the quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter that U.S. and Canada delivered 5% or higher underlying growth.","The international underlying growth was 3% with Asia-Pacific up 7%, EMEA up 2% and Latin America down 1%. First nine months revenue at Marsh was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 4%. U.S. and Canada was up 5%, while international was up 3%.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $273 million in the quarter, underlying growth of 11%. Strength in the quarter was due to solid operating performance and the true-up of a multiyear contract, excluding the multiyear contract adjustment underlying growth was mid-single digits in the quarter.","The first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.3 billion with 4% underlying growth. In the consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was up 8% to $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 4%.","Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $320 million and the adjusted margin increased 50 basis points to 18.11%. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first nine months of 2019 was 4% with consolidated revenue of $5.3 billion.","Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 13% to $916 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 3%, health grew 7% in the quarter, the best underlying growth since the first quarter of 2018.","Carrier underlying growth was solid at 5% and wealth underlying growth was flat with mid-single digit growth and investment management offset by a low single digit decline in our defined benefit business.","Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under management increasing to $290 billion. For the first nine months of the year revenue at Mercer was $3.7 billion with 2% underlying growth.","Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue was $505 million in this quarter with strong underlying growth of 7%. This was the fifth straight quarter of 7% or higher underlying growth at Oliver Wyman. Growth was solid across most regions with our financial services and health and life sciences practices showing particular strength. First nine months of the year revenue was $1.6 billion with 9% underlying growth.","Turning to corporate, adjusted corporate expense was $48 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook we expect approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to the JLT integration, this is our second full quarter post closing and I couldn't be happier with the progress we've made to-date.","Dan said, the integration is going well from an operational perspective and we are on track with our financial target. We continue to expect the transaction will be modestly dilutive to adjusted EPS for the first year, breakeven in year two will be accretive in year three.","We are ahead of schedule on cost savings and associated restructuring charges. We expect to exceed the $250 million of run rate savings and $375 million of cost to achieve those savings. We currently plan to provide an update on our outlook for cost savings on our fourth quarter earnings call.","During the quarter we incurred $133 million of interest expense. We expect around $130 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter we reported $84 million of amortization which includes the JLT related amount as well as amortization from other transactions.","Our overall view of amortization related to the JLT transaction is now $163 million annually. As a result, we expect total deal related amortization in the fourth quarter will be about $93 million.","In aggregate, the financial impact of the JLT transaction is tracking well with our initial expectation. As we look to the four quarter there are few things to keep in mind. Marsh faces the tough underlying revenue comparison to a year ago and a continued impact on new business in JLT's seasonally strongest quarter.","As a result we expect Marsh's underlying growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, but still be solid for the year. In addition, Oliver Wyman tends to be our most volatile business quarter-to-quarter as we've discussed in the past and our current outlook calls for a pullback in the fourth quarter. Overall however, Oliver Wyman is on track for a strong year.","In terms of the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin, we expect strong margin expansion that is moderately higher than the pace year-to-date, which reflects expense savings and a seasonally strong quarter at JLT partially offset by the sale of JLT's aerospace business, which generated nearly all of its earnings in the fourth quarter.","Turning back to the third quarter, we reported $118 million of noteworthy item mostly related to the JLT acquisition. Included in this total are $77 million of JLT integration cost, the largest category which is severance, $21 million of JLT acquisition related cost and $12 million of other restructuring cost mainly related to Mercer's program.","Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis with $3 million of investment income in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance 2019 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis investment income was $7 million in the quarter.","Foreign exchange with the slight benefit to adjusted EPS in this quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be at $0.02 per share headwind in the fourth quarter.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25% compared with 25.3% in the third quarter last year. For the first nine months of the year our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3% compared with 24.5% last year.","Based on the current environment, we continue to expect the tax rate between 25%, 26% for 2019 excluding discrete item. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.6 billion or $12.2 billion excluding commercial paper.","In September, we've repaid $300 million of senior notes that matured consistent with our deleveraging plans. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in March 2020 with $500 million of senior notes will mature.","In the third quarter we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through nine-months we've repurchased 3.1 million shares for $300 million. We continue to expect to repurchase enough shares in 2019 to reduce our share count.","Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash third quarter totaled $486 million and included $53 million for acquisition, $233 million for dividend and $200 million for share repurchase.","For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $7.1 billion and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $655 million for dividend, and $300 million for share repurchase. Overall we're on track to deliver a solid year.","With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Mark. So, Cleena [ph], we're ready to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. First question on the insurance brokerage side of the business; we're increasingly hearing from some of the larger corporations and insurers that the deal with, let's say, Fortune 500 space that pricing is much higher there than let's call it, the SME small and mid size space. I'm aware that Marsh's revenue contracts in that space are more fee-based. And I get asked lot of from clients how do we think about or how is the impact on to the broker when pricing is very high and in the large account space. And maybe you can give us a sense of are you seeing that as well that dynamic and historically have your fee rates, have they increased at a similar rates or maybe they're overall brokerage is organic rate of growth? Anything there would help.","Dan Glaser","Sure. So, I'll start and then I'll hand over to John to give you some more information. Maybe the first thing to know is that, we build the business to operate across cycles. Softening cycles usually last for a long time and there's periods of tightening which generally are much shorter in duration. And so every market is different. But we're built or geared based upon the cycle. You're right in saying that in the large account space, it skews a little bit, or a lot more to fee than to commission. But you have to bear in mind between fees we have discussions with our clients all the time with regard to the value that we're creating. Generally in a large account space it's always a year-over-year type of discussion. It's hard to get fees to increase as you could imagine in large account across the world you have procurement departments and risk management experts who negotiate on their behalf. When we look at it when John and I look at this overall, we were facing a mild headwind for a number of years going back a few years ago and maybe we've a mild tailwind today, but it's not material to the overall performance of the company. But John, you want to tackle that?","John Doyle","Sure, Dan. As you just said, I think it\u2019s a modest tailwind at the moment. I think it's really important to keep in mind of course, there our role is to get the best outcome for the clients, regardless where we are in the pricing cycle. And a good chunk of our portion of our large account business is on a fee, for sure we also have the Marsh Risk Consulting which is a fee-based business and our benefits business which obviously is not subject to the P&C pricing cycle.","At the moment middle market pricing is not moving up as much as large account pricing which we have more exposure to from a commission point of view. We're certainly working with our clients to mitigate the impact of price increases, in a lot of cases that -- whether it's in large accounts or in the middle market that maybe our clients retaining more risk. So it\u2019s a challenging market in some segments. I don't consider it actually one market. It's a collection of markets. But it\u2019s a great time for us with our tremendous talent. We have great talented colleagues and their capabilities to create value for our clients.","Mike Zaremski","Yes. I'll guess, I'll move to the one more on move to defined benefits. You mentioned low single digit decline there. I believe you're in midst of taking actions to try to improve that level going into 2020. And I guess related to given the big dip in interest rates year-to-date versus last year, does that business get a may be a pickup later in the year due to client activity kind of looking into their impacts to the pension funds from low rates?","Dan Glaser","So, Mike, I'll start with that and then hand over to Martine to give you more detail. Mercer has done a really nice job over several years essentially preparing themselves to be able to deliver high-quality services to the client while we're earning a good margin on the business in a secular decline of defined benefit pension plan. And so that's playing itself out. We're not surprised by the low single digit declines. Those declines we saw last year as well. Martine, do you have any further to add about the impact of interest rates and that sort of thing?","Martine Ferland","Yes of course. And as Dan just said, we \u2013 our wealth business is now composed of investment as much as the DB core benefits consulting. And indeed the economic conditions and the market conditions can influence the rhythm at which the employer will decide to deal with their DB plans. So there is a little impact of that. It is a temporary measure because over time these plans are getting closed by times and we are prepared for that.","So, of course also the market conditions do impact our large investments, consultings and in particular our OCIO business. And there again we have a -- our clients maintain very balanced portfolio and therefore the impact is mitigated because we've asset classes across equity, fixed income and alternatives.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on Guy Carpenter. I know you guys said that there was a multiyear contract that did help the organic and ex that, it would it be in the mid single digits this quarter. But that still a nice pickup from where you guys were in the second quarter. I was hoping to get a little bit more color. Was that some new business wins? I know, Dan, you mentioned Cyber retention, because I think last quarter you had mentioned that there was an impact on new business from JLT. So just trying to get a sense of if things turn around a little bit in the third quarter?","Dan Glaser","Sure. And just to be clear. I'm happy to fill in with Peter any time here with double digit quarter. So \u2013 but yes, I was \u2013 you're right, it was a bit of a positive surprise to us in the third quarter. But bear in mind, it\u2019s a small revenue quarter for Guy Carpenter. So it doesn't take much for an outsized quarter in either direction. JLT is going to continue to be a drag to underlying revenue growth as Carpenter rebuilds the new business pipeline, that something that takes multiple quarters to do. But that effort is already underway and so it's not going to last for years. It's temporary.","And in the meantime, Carpenter's doing a great job, managing expenses, deliver earnings growth. We mentioned the multiyear contract true-up and we call it out not because it's unusual, but because it was large in a small quarter and that's why we've raised it, but it's a normal course of business type of situation.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the margins within RAS, JLT was a drag this quarter, but the margin still seems to be trending better than I would have expected. If you could give a little bit of color, I know you guys said saves running better than plan. Were the savings like directionally picked up Q3 to Q2 and then maybe it's some level of improved organic. I'm just trying to get a sense what's driving? Its sill pretty strong margins especially in a quarter where JLT loses money?","Dan Glaser","Yes. So overall the Marsh & McLennan had a pretty materially higher margins than JLT; both very high quality organizations, Marsh & McLennan benefited I think more from some of the scale and broader heft that we had in organization, but every intention was to convert JLT within Marsh & McLennan to Marsh & McLennan style margins and then look to growth from there.","We're pleased with the margin expansions that we're having this year. I mean, we expected it. So as we talked going into the year we've said that we expected to have margin expansion. And it really is about \u2013 we're bringing in more revenue and we're doing it in a more efficient way. So the notion that we feel comfortable at this stage which is still really early stages of coming together as a single organization that we will comfortably exceed to $250 million of expense savings that we cited last September when the deal was announced. As we've mentioned before we believe the majority of those savings are going to drop to the bottom line. And so we're seeing that right now.","And as you can expect, even though JLT, the acquisition itself was not an expense synergy play. It's all about growth. We feel very happy with the level of talent and capabilities, the opportunities for colleagues that are developing and we expect revenues and earnings over time to be better as a result of this combination. But having said all that, we're a well-run organization and when we see areas for capturing efficiencies areas like real estate, technology, functions like finance, legal, HR, risk compliance, all gave us areas to where we believe we can be more efficient together. So what we'll do.","As Mark was mentioning in his script, we'll give a more fulsome update next quarter about where we see the three year expenses and cost of achieving those expense saves. We'll do a review internally and we'll let you know next quarter. Next question please.","Operator","We will now take the next question from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill Partners. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Couple of follow-ups. The issues with the comparison for organic growth in Marsh in the fourth quarter, will that also extend into the first quarter next year given how strong the organic growth was in the first quarter? Or is that not the right comparison, obviously, the JLT deal makes that little bit more complicated?","Dan Glaser","Yes I mean, overall we're pleased with the year to-date performance of not only Marsh but RAS and the overall firm, the consulting segment as well. And we believe the way to evaluate the firm both on the top line and on the bottom line is over multiple quarters. We're not looking at any one quarter. Although having said that, we'll bask in the glory of a terrific third quarter for a little bit of time, but ultimately 2019 is shaping up to be a solid year especially in view of the effort of so many people within the organization who are working on integration efforts. And those are people who are legacy Marsh & McLennan and legacy JLT. We are all working together increasingly as one team to form a new organization that's quite formidable into the future. We wanted to call out the fourth quarter just because we expect it to be more challenging.","We mentioned the importance of new business and new business pipeline. Well, the fourth quarter is JLT's highest new business quarter. So if you play out that logic well then there'll be more strain in terms of achieving what they used to achieve because of pipeline issues that develop soon after the announcement was made. Those things are all solvable. Now whether we extend our view into next year or not, I mean John do you have any early read?","John Doyle","Look, I think you said it well, Dan, that the fourth quarter was such a seasonally strong new business quarter for JLT, so we'll see a little bit more headwind there in the fourth quarter. But we're well-positioned for growth in 2020. So again if you take a longer view, we're confident that where we're positioned in the market.","Dan Glaser","Anything else, Paul.","Paul Newsome","Yes. Just making a really more of a modeling question. There's a fair amount of disposals happening. Obviously you had the aerospace business. It looks like the international business was where the disposals were. How should we think about that little piece going forward when we're trying to get to our organic growth or overall revenue growth estimates into that change with JLT?","Dan Glaser","Yes, Paul. There was a lot of -- the third quarter was noisy in that underlying growth schedule. And there were there are a couple of places There's the sale of aerospace that you mentioned. There was also the sale of a data business in Marsh last year where a gain was recorded in revenues. So there's a little bit of a heavier impact. If you look at the year to-date schedule you'll see a plus one for acquired revenue and that's probably not a bad estimate for the full year. But there's actually -- a lot of the transactions we did this year. so Lovitt & Touche and Bouchard and MMA came relatively early in the year.","So there's less roll over revenue just given the lower activity this year than we would typically have. So maybe a little bit of rollover into the early part of next year and then next year's acquired growth, it would depend on the level of deal activity. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Hi. Good morning. First question is really I guess follow-up on Elyse's question. Just trying to get a sense of what the cost save impact was in the third quarter and maybe even year to date?","Dan Glaser","Yes. We're not going to go into the details of how the cost saves are breaking out per quarter. As I mentioned before this is still really early stages, we're in the second quarter of being a combined company. We believe we have a multiyear approach to capturing the expense savings that we were identifying. We're executing on a lot of different issues right now. I mean, clearly with our margins being up as a company through nine months, pretty much we can say that, we're achieving a lot of savings, right? And it's not impacting growth because we're growing well as a firm. And so, I don't really want to get into a quarter-by-quarter description of all the activity we're doing on the expense side.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Can you at least comment on whether it's more -- if the cost saves should be expected to be more back weighted than front weighted?","Dan Glaser","No. I mean, I think there's partly is what you're seeing in margin right now. Like we're jumping on efficiencies and making savings as we go and so there's not a sense of like all this is going to happen in the third year. I mean, there's many things that we can operate very quickly on. There's other things that take a little bit more time. You take something like as an example the consolidation of vendors or real estate or reducing costs within JLT that were geared to being a public company. Those sort of things we can move pretty quickly on.","There's other areas, let's say some areas of application technology which take a little bit more time as they go. But we have a three-year plan and we're working through it and we expect to have, I mean, this is our 12th year margin expansion, so I'm not going too far out on a limb when I say. Well, I think in 2020 we're going to expand our margin just like we did in 2019 and just like we've done for the last 12 years. And so that's an indication of some of the benefits dropping to the bottom line.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, understood. And my second question goes to the casualty business and Marsh. I guess one thing I struggle with is and this isn't a Marsh issue, it's a broader industry question. I guess we're seeing rate firming, excluding workers comp even as loss picks excluding commercial auto remain pretty low by historical standards. I'm assuming that's something that you as a broker see as well. And just curious as to how much pushback there is in the conversations with insurance on the absence of more material loss trends? Or is it -- or are you actually seeing real time loss trends picking up in claims and margins and maybe not pushing back as much?","Dan Glaser","John, do you want to handle that one?","John Doyle","Sure. The underwriting community is clearly concerned about rising loss cost trends. Dan and I and some of the rest of our leaders have been at Peter Hearn as well have been at number of different conferences where we've spent a lot of time with the markets of late. So -- and there are clearly some very, very large casualty losses in the markets where there's a lot of discussion of course about cap property, but there are some casualty cat events that are in the market that are concerned. And then there's some big headline, verdicts and settlements that have underwriters concerned as well.","I think we've seen loss cost trends begin to emerge more quickly. Commercial auto pricing has been up there for a number of different quarters. Overall casualty pricing at the moment is mixed. Work Comp is down five GL primary GL pricing is still down modestly including in the United States, but excess liability is up 6% versus 3% in the second quarter and that market seeing a bit more stress at the moment. So we of course again are trying to get the best outcome for our clients and we'll find solutions no matter where they might be in the world.","But I do expect upward pricing pressure to continue throughout next year. However I think we'll see shorter and shallower cycles than we have on average in the past, so really kind of micro cycles. Underwriters are moving quickly to get better data, better management information. They're moving more quickly to deal with things. But capital moves very quickly to where profit pools emerge as well. So again I expect more shallow and shorter pricing cycles.","Dan Glaser","I mean that's really, I think John's point is really important to emphasize here. Better management teams at underwriting firms, better data and analytics creates more of a micro cycle environment where it's not necessarily broad across all sectors and all segments. And that's really occurring on the reinsurance side as well. We're not seeing broad market wide impact even as a result of the loss creep that we've seen over the last six months coming in from prior years and some big losses this year. But there is potential significant changes on individual programs based upon the individual programs characteristics like geography performance in the past and that sort of thing. So I think the better data and analytics are making it more of a targeted approach as opposed to broad brush. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Crystal Lu","Hi. This is Crystal Lu in for Ryan Tunis. So our first question is about the EMEA organic growth. It seems to have been improving recently. Can you just give some comments on what drove organic growth improvement there?","Dan Glaser","Go ahead, John.","John Doyle","Sure. I would say first of all overall I was pleased with the growth in the quarter at 70% GAAP growth, 5% underlying growth. Mark talked about the strong consistent growth in the United States. So internationally we're up 3% on a rolling basis. In EMEA we have very good results in continental Europe. We had excellent growth in the Middle East then in Africa as well. In the U.K., our results are showing some positive momentum. As I've talked about in the past we've made some leadership changes there. It's a challenging environment. Obviously the U.K. economy creating a bit of a drag force at the moment. But our leadership team is really on it and so I see some improving trends there of course as we look into next year.","Crystal Lu","Great. And then on the retention compensation that's coming through. Can you give an idea of what kind of quarterly level we should expect on retention compensation going forward? And when we can expect these payments to be concluded? Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Yes. I mean it's in the context of acquisitions that we've done in the past it's quite common for us to either have earn out arrangements or to have some sort of retention payments tied to a multiyear view of how a person performs within the business. And so we view that is as kind of normal. It's all been modeled within our original deal consideration. You'd expect that to really be more in the first year or 18 months and then reduced from there because it is geared towards assisting in the transition of the organization to a new organization. And so I wouldn't expect any significant levels to persist over a many year period. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Styblo","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just hoping we could peel back the onion little bit more on the cost saves and if you can provide additional color about the increased level that you're expecting to achieve in any out year there. Is that more of just finding more opportunities within the same subset or there just some new things that are emerging and to the extent that tying that to the accretion guidance. Is it a situation where maybe you just don't want to comment yet on perhaps doing better than break even next year or perhaps should we expect that there might be an update where there could be some upside to the breakeven target for next year?","Dan Glaser","I mean in any large organization and in any large combination there's a series of puts and takes. And I think this is how you need to view this. And that we did not know on the day of acquisition that we would have to dispose of the aerospace business as an example. On the other hand, we had an idea that $250 million or so of expense synergies should be achievable over a three-year period. So the fact that we're able to achieve more than that, but at the same time we've had some disposals that we did not anticipate. And I can tell you there's probably a dozen of these puts and takes that you look forward. And we end up about where we're exceeding our expectations mildly on virtually every measure and we end up with the view that it's going to be on an adjusted basis slightly dilutive to what we otherwise would have done this year, breakeven next year and accretive in year three. And so that's kind of where we are.","The organization for a long period of time has become more and more efficient. We continue to see ways of becoming more efficient. And we run ourselves very much to where we've got four very strong brands, but we're not a holding company just operating a business that is not cohesive, where we are close to the client we're commercially agile, nimble, highly segmented, highly specialized. The further you are away from the client we're more horizontal and we capture synergies around finance, legal H.R. and other functional costs. We're smart about how we approach the use of service operations in places like India and Poland, in Kuala Lumpur and we will continue to do that. Personally I think we're at the early stage of being able to look at AI, machine learning, robotics as a way to increase the efficiency of the business. And so that we can look out for several years and believe we can continue to expand margins in the business.","David Styblo","Great. That's helpful to frame it. Thanks for that, Dan. Maybe a follow-up for a Mark real quick. Do you have a maybe some initial thoughts about how we should think about capital deployment in 2020? Would it be maybe perhaps the same approach for 2019 where you'd buy enough stock to help shares come down a little bit while paying down debt and opportunistically looking for M&A Or would there be any noticeable changes from how you approach this year?","Mark McGivney","Yes. David going back to as with a lot of things that we said initially that things are playing out very, very close to where we initially thought they would and that that applies to capital management as well. So this year is played out almost exactly as we thought. If you remember back to some of the things we said, we said the focus for capital management for the first couple of years would be deleveraging, but in those plans that we provided enough flexibility for return of capital as well as M&A with the focus for M&A being on Marsh & McLennan Agency.","And so, as we look out to 2020 they're really still is the focus. That we're focused on the deleveraging and that we see -- we've provided for some flexibility so that we will be able to have some return of capital as well and continue to focus on M&A, really the balance between those two is just going to depend on the strength of the M&A pipeline.","Dan Glaser","Yes. I think it's important to remember, the way we prioritize our capital deployment is we put organic investment ahead of everything else that we put our dividend which we believe is sacrosanct. Then we've made a commitment to increase our dividend double digit each year and we intend to continue to do that. We have said in the past that we favor acquisitions over share repurchase and we favored share repurchase over growing cash on our balance sheet.","So when you look at it in that context you have to recognize that that if push came to shove, we would favor acquisitions over share repurchase. And the way we're looking at our pipeline is very strong. And so we will continue to take steps to make us a stronger company. And if that means that that puts a little pressure sometimes on share repurchase then so be it. Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Two very quick questions. First, can you give us a sense as to what clients are assuming for exposure in a growth as they do their 2020 planning?","Dan Glaser","Well, that's a good question and a tough one. So John, I don't think clients are assuming you need exposure. They have their own units of exposure growth. But I would say is that in some of the more mature economies that we operate in where we have big revenue stream. There continues to be particularly there in the United States, modest exposure grew up. So employment continues to grow. Sales are growing. The number of vehicles on the street more flat for example, but most areas of exposure management in mature markets are showing some modest growth.","Meyer Shields","Okay.","Dan Glaser","Go ahead. Next question, Meyer.","Meyer Shields","So, I'm just going to ask, with regard to the Guy Carpenter true-up, does all of that adjustment fall to the bottom line? Or they're offsetting expenses?","Dan Glaser","That's a great one. Mark, do you want to handle that. I mean, there's always the bonus pool. So nothing fully drops to the bottom line.","Mark McGivney","Our bonus pools tend to be geared to earnings, but other than that it really does fall into the quarter.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks so much.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Our next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks. First one just curious Lat-Am, negative organic, I think it's the first time I've ever seen that out of the Lat-Am business. Is that related to JLT or something else happened there?","Dan Glaser","Yes. So you're right in citing that. I mean this is the first quarter of negative growth in Lat-Am since we started reporting Lat-Am in the first quarter of 2008. It's a great region for us and it's usually neck and neck over long stretches of time with Asia as to which growth is better. But there's some particular issues that we're facing in Lat-Am in the short term. But John you want to give more color.","John Doyle","Sure. It is Legacy JLT related. It's both new business so we've talked about kind of more broadly and to larger non-recurring items in the region of where I would say though that the region absolutely remains a growth market for us. I'm really encouraged by how the teams are coming together at both Marsh and JLL. Well, it'll be a choppy second half for Latin America. I do expect good growth from the region in 2020.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then, Mark just curious, a pop in CapEx in the quarter looks like $123 million. Was there something kind of unusual going in that and also in that free cash flow actually was pretty strong. Or was there anything unusual maybe in operating cash flow?","Dan Glaser","Mark.","Mark McGivney","Yes, sure. Let me tackle CapEx first. It did increase. It was mainly related to timing of big real estate projects and that we can see that volatility from year-to-year and actually for -- it will not remain at that level into the fourth quarter. And fourth quarter we're probably looking more in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter over the last couple years. So it's just a couple of big real estate projects. It\u2019s actually level in Q2 was a little bit lower for the same reason. In terms of cash flow growth is actually a really good story and what our operating cash flow notwithstanding all of the integration related charges was only down 2%. I thought that was a really good result in the context of what we're going through. So there is nothing unusual in that.","Brian Meredith","Right. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks and good morning. I'm not sure there's anything else to ask specifically on your quarter. So I'm just curious with social inflation being the big topic in the underwriting world. I wonder if you guys could either take your intermediary experiences or go back to your underwriting days and maybe just give your perspective on what's going out there and whether there's any analogies you would draw to past periods where the industry might have experienced some of these similar challenges?","Dan Glaser","John has forgotten more about underwriting than I ever knew. So John, you want to take that?","John Doyle","Look, I think, I mean it's apparent to me that the underwriting committee is struggling to figure out what the trend line is, right? And much like I think I said pricing, it\u2019s not one market, it's a collection of markets. I think the challenge is it's not one trend line, right. And so, as I said earlier there are some pretty big very material casualty losses in the market. And then you're seeing where you have kind of more data and more frequency in commercial auto, a clear trend that's emerged over the course of the last several years.","And in the case of auto it's got a shorter duration to it as than other liability lines. So it's quite again clear that they're trying to sort that out. But again our responsibilities serving our client and trying to come up with the best outcome for them in this market. But I would expect a bit more stress in the near term in the access liability market in particular. There are some areas where you can point to meaningful exposure changes, right. So in the case of D&O maybe for example, there's been a material increase in the frequency of securities claims that are in the market, right.","That's obviously in the aggregate needs to be priced for. So there are some segments where you're seeing clear exposure changes then in other areas of risk could you see higher settlements and judgments for a lot of reasons.","Dan Glaser","Yes. I mean we were talking recently about worker's comp. I mean in tie for one reason or another and you can have a lot of opinions about what's underneath it. But in times of full employment worker's comp claims tend to go down and in times of economic stress they tend to go up. And so, it's sort of worker's comp claims are in decent shape now, but that doesn't mean it's a permanent trend line, and that may reverse with economic stress.","John Doyle","I would also point out, Dan. that after the financial crisis, we had a period where there wasn't real loss cost inflation, right? Claim transfer were quite stable, in fact, in some lines of business there was deflation which isn't what we normally observe over a long period of time. But clearly we've come out of that environment.","Dan Glaser","Anything else Larry?","Larry Greenberg","No. That's good. Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Thanks Cleena. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to express my gratitude to our 75,000 colleagues for the commitment and hard work that they show us all the time, as well as to our clients for their support. Thank you all very much and we'll speak to you next quarter.","Operator","That will conclude today's call. Thanks for your participation.

I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Following my comments, Dan and Mike will discuss our operating and financial results in more detail.","As you all know, I'll be retiring at the end of the year, so today is my last time that I will have the pleasure of leading our earnings call. I'll say a little more about that later after we review our results. First, I would like to take a minute to discuss the effects of Sandy, a storm of historic proportions. As you're all aware, recovery efforts are underway and the sense of normalcy is returning to impacted areas. Full recovery in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut may take months, if not years. The safety of our colleagues has been our first priority, and we are grateful that we have received no reports of serious injuries.","From a business perspective, we are fortunate that our offices have not sustained any significant damage. Our colleagues are working diligently to assist clients who have been affected by this disaster. We also commend our colleagues for the compassion and concern they have shown each other and for doing everything they can for their communities. The storm underscores the critical nature of insurance and the crucial services we provide to clients. While the market impact of Sandy is yet to be determined, generally, there is sufficient capital in the market. However, we do expect the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions will be under more scrutiny from underwriters on the heels of 2 major storms within 14 months.","Moving to our financial results. I'm pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect our ongoing strong performance this year. We continue to deliver growth in underlying revenue and earnings in both of our operating segments. This reflects our continuing progress in establishing Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite enterprise. In the third quarter, consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3%. Combined with ongoing control of expenses and effective capital management, we produced double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and earnings per share, an excellent performance.","Risk and Insurance Services produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Adjusted operating income rose 13% with Marsh, an expansion of 130 basis points. The Consulting segment also delivered solid underlying revenue growth in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15%, reflecting double-digit growth at both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. The adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points. We've seen higher margins for the Consulting segment each quarter this year. Both segments produced excellent results for the year-to-date as well, with solid underlying revenue growth, double-digit earnings growth and substantial margin improvement. We are pleased with this performance.","And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our third quarter results in more detail.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Brian and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, Marsh & McLennan delivered strong financial performance. We achieved increased underlying revenue growth at each operating company, which extends this trend of growth into the third consecutive year. Continued top line growth, combined with prudent expense management, produced a 12% increase in adjusted operating income. Risk and Insurance Services revenue rose 2% in the third quarter, which is our seasonally lightest quarter. Underlying revenue growth was 4%. Adjusted operating income increased 13% to $213 million, and the adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points in the quarter and 150 basis points year-to-date.","While producing these excellent results, we continued to make investments to enhance client service and improve operational efficiencies. Marsh produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue rose 4% with all geographies contributing. Asia Pacific increased 7%; EMEA grew 5%; Latin America rose 5%; and the U.S.\/Canada division increased 3%. Marsh continued to generate strong levels of new business of $260 million in the quarter.","Guy Carpenter produced another quarter of underlying revenue growth, a trend we have seen each of the last 15 quarters. On last quarter's earnings call, we indicated that Guy Carpenter would likely see only modest revenue growth in the second half of this year, since July renewal pricing stabilized for property catastrophe coverage and several key clients increased their risk retention levels. And we saw this in the third quarter, with Guy Carpenter's underlying revenue growth of 1%.","Turning to our Consulting segment, underlying revenue increased 3%. Coupled with expense discipline, Consulting's third quarter results demonstrate substantial progress in the execution of our strategy to increase profitability. Both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to the segment's double-digit growth in earnings and a significantly higher operating margin. Adjusted operating income rose 15% to $192 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 14.3%, which is the segment's highest margin in 7 years.","At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 3%. Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest sector, was the primary driver of this growth. Geographically, Oliver Wyman's revenue increase was driven by the North American region as we have seen throughout the year. We are expecting a modest decline in underlying revenue for Oliver Wyman in the fourth quarter due to 2 factors. In Europe, Oliver Wyman continues to feel the impact of slower economic growth and declining business confidence and as we discussed previously, the timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance criteria improved Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth by 3 percentage points in the first quarter, and will reduce revenue by the same amount in the fourth quarter.","Mercer\u2019s third quarter underlying revenue grew 3%. This increase reflected higher revenue across all regions, with the strongest growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Looking at Mercer\u2019s underlying revenue by line of business, Investments grew 10%; Health & Benefits increased 7%; Outsourcing rose 2%; Talent, Rewards & Communications was up 1%; and Retirement was flat.","In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's growth and profitability in the third quarter. Our leadership team and our colleagues have continued to deliver exceptional performance consistent with our long-term goals to produce adjusted operating income growth of at least 10%, adjusted EPS growth approaching 13% and total shareholder return of 16%. As we have said before, while we may not achieve double-digit earnings growth every year, we remain confident that we can produce this level of growth over the long term.","Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to say a few words about Brian. To say we are a very different company today than we were 5 years ago is an understatement. Under his leadership, we restructured and repaired our Risk and Insurance business, successfully navigated the Great Recession, settled legacy issues that were impeding our ability to grow and invest, streamlined and strengthened our portfolio and dramatically improved our financial results. Today, we are a growing, thriving organization built for long-term success. Our financial performance speaks for itself. What isn't captured on our income statement is the sense of pride Brian restored to the organization, the belief that we truly belong among the world's elite companies. We owe him a debt of gratitude. So on behalf of our leadership team, our colleagues and our shareholders, I thank Brian for his unparalleled leadership.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I think we all feel the same way about Brian.","Our consolidated revenue was $2.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 12% to $358 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points to 12.6%. GAAP earnings per share was $0.44 and $0.43 from continuing operations. Adjusted earnings per share grew from $0.24 in the third quarter of last year to $0.39 this quarter. But last year's third quarter results included a cost of $72 million or approximately $0.09 per share related to the early extinguishment of debt. So we feel the true growth of EPS on an adjusted basis in the third quarter was 18%, a very strong performance.","For the 9 months, consolidated underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income rose 13% to $1.4 billion and the adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 15.8%. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.66. Adjusted earnings per share increased 25%. But excluding the early extinguishment of debt, the growth in adjusted EPS was 17%.","In looking at year-to-date profitability by segment, adjusted operating income for Risk and Insurance Services increased 13% to $1 billion with a margin of 20.9%, reflecting an increase on a year-over-year basis of 150 basis points. For our Consulting segment, adjusted operating income increased 17% to $528 million with a year-to-date margin of 13.2% or an improvement of 160 basis points.","We recently closed 2 Marsh & McLennan agency acquisitions, representing approximately $30 million of revenue. Over the past 3 years, Marsh & McLennan Agency has acquired 24 companies, with annualized revenue now totaling over $400 million. Many of these acquisitions include contingent consideration or earn outs. These balance sheet liabilities are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes to the company's projections of revenue and earnings. We believe it is appropriate to exclude these adjustments from our adjusted earnings as shown in our supplemental schedules on Pages 9 and 10.","Interest expense was $44 million in the third quarter compared with $49 million last year, and the only debt maturity we have over the next 18 months is the $250 million senior note due in February of 2013. With respect to investment income for the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be de minimis, an improvement from the $4 million loss in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now turning to capital management. Our cash position at the end of September exceeded $2 billion and in deploying our excess cash in the third quarter, we used $127 million for dividends, $30 million for acquisitions and $80 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares in the quarter. In fact, over the last 2 years, we have repurchased 21 million shares for $627 million, leaving $373 million remaining under our current board authorization.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you, Mike. Well, this is my 20th call since I joined Marsh & McLennan Companies in January 2008, and during that time, we've been able to build on our progress each quarter. Extremely gratifying to think about how far we've come. I've said many times that joining this organization was a calling, and reestablishing the company to its preeminent position is truly one of the highlights of my career.","I am leaving this great company in extremely capable hands. The Board of Directors and I have every confidence that Dan will continue to capitalize on the strengths of Marsh & McLennan to deliver superior value to its clients, shareholders and colleagues.","In closing, I'd like to thank our colleagues for choosing to do business with -- our clients for choosing to do business with us, our shareholders for their continued confidence and most importantly, our colleagues, everything we have accomplished over the last 5 years is due to their efforts.","And with that operator, let's begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just go into the organic growth side. It sounds like Oliver Wyman's slowing down into the fourth quarter and really, it's a world where the macro seems to be getting a bit slower. So how do you guys feel about the organic from here? And then very importantly, what is your ability or visibility on the margin side as organic comes in perhaps a little slower than what we've enjoyed in previous -- in the previous couple of years.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Greg. I think Dan may start this, but we might hear from the other guys. Dan?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So overall, I think you're right in saying that the macro factors probably have more of a immediate influence on Oliver Wyman than other operating companies because more of their revenue is project work as opposed to annuitized or productized types of capabilities that reoccur each year. We separate out the view of organic growth from really where we're going to expand our margin. We look at our revenue and our expenses as being very much aligned, and we look at how we'll do on the revenue side as we think about what kind of inflation we could accept within the expense side. You can grow your margin really in any environment. Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to grow your margin in certain environments, but each of our operating companies are different. And when we look forward, we're quite comfortable that both of our segments will be able to continue to grow their margins over a pretty long stretch of time and both segments have different needs in terms of what revenue growth that they would need in order to comfortably expand their margins. So why don't -- why doesn't John expand a little bit just specifically on what Oliver Wyman's facing?","John P. Drzik","So I think on last quarter's call, we had indicated that we had seen some weakening in business conditions in our pipeline for the second half of the year. So you saw the pace of our growth dropped in the third quarter, and we're now, as Dan highlighted in his comments, expecting to see some further weakening in fourth quarter next year tied to business conditions, principally the weaker business conditions that we're seeing in Europe, but even in North America, we're seeing some weakening. So that is affecting us, so that is the planning context that we're using for the future as well. And as Dan highlighted, I think that we can continue to build the business and grow our margin even in some weakened business conditions.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is that a commentary just for Oliver Wyman or is that more for the overall Consulting segment?","Daniel S. Glaser","We don't disclose margin specifically for Mercer or Oliver Wyman separately, so it is for the overall Consulting segment.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. But you guys are feeling very confident that the margin trajectory can continue even in a world where the organic were to slow? And we don't know what it's going to do several quarters out, but that's a world which you guys can navigate and hit the 10% up income guidance.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. But I wouldn't make a blanket statement quite that broadly. I mean, because as I was saying before, there would be certain market environments where it surely would be poor for the business' midterm and long-term aspects if we drove for margin improvement in that time. If we're in a world like we are today, let's say, where all of our operating companies are within 3% or 4% organic growth, then we're quite comfortable we would be able to expand margins on that basis.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Last one for me is just, Dan, you're going to inherit a pristine balance sheet from Brian. Any thoughts on capital management or change in appetite for buybacks or anything?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I think that kind of question's a little premature. But I would say that in general, whether we're talking about the actual business strategies or strategies around capital management, you have to bear in mind that our overall leadership group is a closely knit team. And so the strategies that we've developed, it won't be my strategies and it weren't particularly Brian's strategies, this was the team of Marsh & McLennan strategies and I would think you'll see some real consistency over long stretches of time.","Operator","Next we'll go to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Two questions. Just wondering if you would comment on whether foreign exchange had a larger than normal impact on earnings in the quarter? And then just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the -- that adjustment in the RIS section for the re-measurement of contingent acquisitions and just what went into that?","Brian Duperreault","Sure, sure, sure. FX, all right, well, Michael, that's yours.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you. As you can see from what we disclosed, Larry, on the revenue, you can see that overall, the currency impact on revenue was minus 3% for the quarter. But your question was specifically addressed, I think, to how it affected earnings. And I would say there was a slight headwind for us on an earnings side in the quarter, both for Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, fairly similar to what we had seen in the first and second quarter as well.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. So Mike, why don't you elaborate on the RIS adjustment?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes. The bulk of the adjustment that we had on contingent considerations was in RIS. I think there's $1 million in our Consulting segment. And Larry, what this really has to do is really what we would view as purchase price adjustments. When we do the acquisitions, predominantly in Marsh & McLennan Agency, but not just for them, it could include other acquisitions. In many cases, we would have earn outs and the earn outs are predicated with regard to what the projections over a 2- or 4-year period may be between us and the sellers with regard to revenue and more importantly, earnings growth and capabilities. And so we put that on our balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and we look at those every quarter to see if the adjustments need to be moved up or down. And we have disclosed that information every quarter. This is the largest adjustment that we've seen. And you can see that this quarter, we made an adjustment essentially of $26 million, the bulk of it in Risk and Insurance Services, just to refine those adjustments. So we view it mainly as a balance sheet item and for that reason, we put it in the adjusted schedules and lay it out, so that every analyst and investor can see the actual impact in the quarter.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","And so is the conclusion that the -- given that this was a positive adjustment, is the conclusion the revenue is not coming in -- the revenue and\/or profits are not coming in as originally targeted?","J. Michael Bischoff","That would be the conclusion if you were very specific, but you have to look at the magnitude of the deals that we've done and put this into context. So if you look at the considerations that we have and you're basically looking at deals over a 3-year period, that ballpark are $800 million and in one particular quarter, based upon what the projections maybe going forward over the next 2 or 3 years is in the neighborhood of $25 million, you can see that it's fairly de minimis. And by the way, these adjustments do occur every quarter and they move up and down. Within that, that's aggregate of all the deals that we've had and we've actually had some of the deals that have been exceeding our expectations. So this refinement, you'll see every quarter. We'll present it to you and we're excluding it from our adjusted earnings. I would say, by the way, you're right, it was a positive in the quarter and so it increased GAAP earnings by $0.04 and we felt that probably wasn't appropriate for an adjusted basis.","Operator","And next, we're going to go to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question, Mike, CapEx really popped up in the quarter. Anything unusual in the CapEx line? Is that kind of the run rate we should expect here going forward?","J. Michael Bischoff","Brian, that's a good observation. We noticed it ourselves. It actually occurred in the second quarter as well. It moved up to about $100 million in the second quarter, and $100 million roughly in the third quarter. So we're tracking roughly around $300 million to $350 million of CapEx expenditures. And I think this speaks to what Dan had articulated in his remarks, where we were making investments -- continuing to make investments in our businesses. And over the last 2 quarters, some of that CapEx expenditure was specifically for Mercer. Some of it was specifically at Marsh and some of it was also at the parent company. So that would be a fairly decent run rate, I would think, that you could use, Brian, going forward even though it may move around quarter-to-quarter.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then next question, is it possible to get a sense of what the recent acquisitions over the last 12 months, how they kind of impacted earnings in the quarter and then maybe just what the M&A pipeline looks like?","J. Michael Bischoff","I can say from the standpoint of the acquisition, the impact in the quarter, we do lay that out in our supplemental schedules, and you can see it was 1%. I would also say that, that acquisition disposition schedule also uses adjustments or transfers that we would have between our businesses just to make sure that it's consistent within the operating segments and for the operating companies. So actually, the impact on acquisitions for us in this quarter was fairly de minimis.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the impact -- okay, great. And then MMA outlook?","Daniel S. Glaser","The pipeline is actually very strong for, really, for both segments. When we look in terms of RIS specifically, it's not just the MMA segment, the Marsh & McLennan Agency, but really, we're well positioned as a leader around the world and we are an attractive buyer to many companies. And so we're -- we have conversations often. We don't do many deals, but we're certainly looking at a lot of things.","Operator","And next, from Barclays, we have Jay Gelb.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This question is for Alex. On the Guy Carpenter organic revenue growth, should we -- I know that could be depressed in 4Q as well. What are your expectations in terms of the potential uplift as a result of Sandy headed into 2013?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Okay. It's early days at the moment. We've seen a number of estimates ranging from $20 billion for 2012 or to $50 billion as regards the economic or even insured losses. There's enough global capacity for that to be swallowed, so we don't expect to see rates increasing across the globe. If we look at the Northeast, as Brian said, there's going to be some more attention, you would think, to the Northeast, more, both on the modeling side as well as on the underwriting side. And we would expect that it could be tough for an underwriter to say that they're going to reduce rates in the Northeast going forward. So there might be some tailwind there, but globally, we don't expect to see tailwinds.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. Okay. And then switching gears to Dan on the Risk and Insurance Services margin. There continues to be sustained improvement there and I'm just wondering if that will help offset some of the headwinds we're seeing in the Consulting businesses, specifically Oliver Wyman.","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, I think in -- if you look at our margin expansion through the year in each of the segments, it's pretty consistent. And we outlined, as part of our strategy, the notion that we thought our Consulting margins, which had really hit a trough right after the Great Recession. So in 2009, they were down to 10.3%, that we were on a path to improve those margins, not only to reach our historical performance levels, but really to optimize the use of our scale and our global footprint to deliver really good Consulting margins. And so we've been on that path: 10.3% in '09; 11.4% in 2010; 11.8% in 2011; and 13.2% year-to-date. And so we don't believe we're getting off of that path, even with what we're seeing today, with some macro weakness affecting Oliver Wyman. So if you put it into context as well in terms of size, Mercer\u2019s quite a bit larger than Oliver Wyman in terms of its impact on the overall Consulting segment. So as we look at -- if we're in a world like we look at today, which is sort of uncertain but grinding it out, we feel that we'll remain on that path of improving margins in both in RIS and our Consulting segment.","J. Michael Bischoff","This is Mike Bischoff. Let me just give a little bit more color to the background of your question and then throw it over to John to elaborate. The environment that we're seeing in Europe, Oliver Wyman has faced actually the last 4 quarters, where we've really seen declines in revenue with regard to their European Consulting practices. What offset that was very strong growth in North America and we continue to see that through the third quarter as well. But I think what John is indicating that, that very strong growth is just going down to very good growth and that with the continuation of what we're seeing with regard to Europe really gets us a little bit more of a balance in the fourth quarter, and not feeling terrible about going into next year, but John?","John P. Drzik","Yes, I think the last couple of years, we've been in a weak recovery environment in North America and pretty much a 0 growth plus or minus environment in Europe. So as we're looking into 2013, we expect to see a broad continuation of that environment. As Mike said, our very rapid growth in the U.S. has tapered a bit in the second half and that's been one of the contributors to the weakening growth overall and we had relatively challenging conditions throughout the year in Europe. And we don't, at this juncture, see those as getting worse, just more of a continuation of that going into next year, but perhaps not offset as much by the strong growth in the U.S. that we had in the first half of the year.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, Mike, just a separate one. On the tax rate, was it depressed by anything in 3Q and should we use a 30% effective tax rate going forward?","J. Michael Bischoff","No, a very good question. As we look through the first 3 quarters of the last year, the adjusted tax rate was 30%. As we look through, not only this quarter but the year-to-date, the adjusted tax rate was 30%. So it's comparable year-to-year but, Jay, there always is discrete items in every quarter. So modeling going forward, anywhere in the 30% to 31% range, I think is very appropriate for a tax rate.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First one, the investment income, that number obviously jumps around, it's very hard to predict. Can you give us any sense of what you would view as a normalized number for that line item?","Brian Duperreault","Michael?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, Jay, very good question. I would say that roughly 75% of the investments that we have in that line are tied to Trident II, and Trident II was created as an investment fund back in 1999. It really had a 10-year life and so we're kind of wondering why it still is continuing now into 2012. But if you look at it, and because in Trident II, which we do not control or manage, the main investment that they have is a public company, they have to mark it to market on a quarterly basis. And we pull that on a quarter lag basis into our results, which is thus the movement up and down of their portfolio is what causes the movement up and down in our investment income. To get really to the heart of your question though, you're asking how should you look at it. Our investments in this space are roughly $100 million and you would look in a normalized basis that we should be producing a couple million a quarter out of a real long-term investment strategy. So we would be happy when the volatility ends and when Trident II is basically closed down.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful, Mike. The other one is the adjustments to the acquisition-related accounts, the $25 million. Where is that in the P&L? Where is the adjustment being made?","J. Michael Bischoff","If you look at it from the standpoint -- and by the way, if you want more information on that, we do put it in our financials footnotes. I think it's Footnote 11 and when you see the Q every quarter, you can track and look at it. And essentially, on that fair value measurement, you will see how we go through it and the contingent consideration can include both the consideration that's just deferred and will be paid, as well as the balance sheet adjustments that we make. And because we are doing acquisitions, you'll see additions to that typically every quarter and you'll see payments every quarter and then you'll see the adjustments to fair value. To give you an idea of where that balance is at the end of the third quarter, it's $78 million. So essentially, what we've been dealing with is about $100 million with regard to the results. So it just basically flows through the different segments and the operating income that we have and you would essentially just be reversing the liabilities, so it would flow through, in that regard, through our P&L.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But it's a bunch of different line items, there's no one quick adjustment. So if I wanted adjust your P&L for this quarter based on the information I have for that number, I really couldn't do it.","J. Michael Bischoff","No, Jay, you could. We give out that information every quarter and it is one line and you can see and you can see it by segment. And if you need some help in it, Scott, Douglas or I will give it to you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I had 2 questions. One was just can you talk a little bit -- I mean, obviously acquisitions are one way of growing your business. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how headcount is changing in the company this year and maybe how much -- especially maybe more on the client facing side and maybe what your plans are in that regard as you look into next year? And then also I'd just be curious, obviously with health care reform and the like, we've had questions on this call about exchanges for a while, but I guess, should we expect to see an announcement from Mercer or the company at large on exchanges anytime soon? And if so, are we more likely to see those coming through on the healthcare side or retirement side or both?","Brian Duperreault","Well, you can expect to hear something from Julio in a minute. But before that occurs, maybe Dan can talk about the headcount.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. So on an -- first thing about the company on an overall basis, the headcount has been pretty consistent over a long stretch of time. There's been movement in the parts of it as we've gone through early stage restructurings 4 or 5 years ago, which sort of reduced the non-client facing parts of the business and pushed more toward the client and the RIS segment in particular. But if you look over the course of say, 2008, at the end of the year, we were about 54,000 all in, and now we're very close to 54,000 all in. So over many years, we've been pretty consistent on the client side -- on the overall colleague side. Much of our colleague growth has been via acquisitions. So as an example, within Marsh & McLennan Agency, we have about 1,500 people within that. We added 700 or 800 people with the Alexander Forbes acquisition. So ultimately, the headcount growth has largely been around acquisitions as opposed to any kind of organic growth within the headcount.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is that likely to change anytime soon? Or is that -- we should expect more of the same amount?","Daniel S. Glaser","No, I think you'll see more of the same in that the -- if you factor out acquisitions for a second, you'll find us becoming more and more efficient in how we run our business, but the headcount line staying largely the same because we're taking headcount that we find more efficient ways to run the business and we reallocate that headcount toward the client-facing roles.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. So Julio, exchanges.","Julio A. Portalatin","Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Matthew, for the question. As you know, this is a big topic for the industry and for our business right now. In fact, I just got back from D.C. where we had a chance to host a panel discussion on health care reform, among leading experts and many of them who advise the current administration on health care reform and of course, exchanges in particular. Private exchange is generally considered to be an easy access through a marketplace approach for a better employee choice options and of course, cost control. And we spend a lot of time at our clients educating them on the concept and of course, you see some of the growth that we're seeing in our Health & Benefits line because of some of that extra work that's coming our way as a result of the Affordable Care Act. We have lots of options already that are before our clients that we're actually using to address some of the choice and cost control. One of them is Mercer Health Advantage and that is actually an opportunity for people to participate and for clients to participate with their employees to take advantage of scale and discounts that we give through Mercer Health Advantage. And in fact, we have about 14 employers that are already participating on this. We anticipate to sign up somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 employees and their families through this vehicle that will, of course, go through 2014 and 2013 as well. So Mercer -- we also have Mercer Marsh benefits, which of course is a great way internationally of facing the market to give additional choice options and cost control and we will be announcing soon a partnership in the Medicare retirement space that will also have us actively involved. And I'd like to also mention that it is our full intention to have an active exchange in place for 2013 enrollment. And so as you mentioned earlier, stay tuned as things continue to develop.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That advantage product, is that -- that's a scale program for multiple employers, but is that one carrier supported?","Julio A. Portalatin","No, it's actually multi-carrier supported and will continue to be an option for those that are looking purely for the discount side, right? There's different types of active exchanges will give different types of affordable options and certainly, the marketplace option is being considered for private exchange would be a little bit more expansive than what we offer Mercer Health Advantage, but nonetheless very attractive. Keep in mind that employees are at different stages of trying to figure out what they're actually going to do with private exchanges. And during this stage, they are very receptive to an option like Mercer Health Advantage, as demonstrated by 14 employers and 400,000 employee and families who are choosing that option.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Just a quick question, I guess, maybe sticking with Julio for a second. I know -- I think Dan, in his prepared remarks, mentioned some growth in Latin America and Asia. Just curious kind of where the growth within Mercer overall, where it's coming from right now relative to the U.S. versus just broadly international. I know you guys don't disclose that, but can you give a sense of the growth trajectory there?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, let me comment, if I may, for a second on the third quarter that incorporates some of what you're asking here. We had a pretty solid performance for Mercer in the quarter and so I'm pretty pleased. And even though we've had continued softness, as many have mentioned, in the global economy, we continue to manage tightly our expenses and of course, invest in things that we think are going to give us good growth. And one of the overall objectives, of course, is to continue to become more significant in what we call our growth markets and growth economies because we see them as being able to come out of some of the global challenges a little bit quicker than perhaps some of the mature ones and thus, that's an important emphasis for us. Overall, our underlying growth for the quarter was 3%, it's consistent with what we've been running in the quarter and last quarter and of course, on our year-to-date basis. So as far as revenue, what we disclosed, as you know, is by our line of businesses. And our Health & Benefits business, as I mentioned earlier, is 7% up and Investment's a strong 10% up and those 2 are carrying the day and you can imagine that those 2 are also playing very well in some of the growth economies. So it's not -- it wouldn't be surprising to see that we are really doing very well in our growth economies and well into the double digits, I think, is fair to say. And we continue to want to invest there and see more type of profitable revenue growth from those areas of the world.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's certainly helpful. And then maybe moving on, similar question to Peter, if he's there in the room, just given I guess the organic growth, what we've seen over the past few quarters out of Latin America and Asia, it looked like it slowed down a little bit. I know the comps are getting difficult given the double-digit growth, but how should we think about that going forward?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Ray. Overall, for Marsh, we had very strong revenue growth with our renewal book, as stated in opening comments, over $260 million of new business and it was spread out across the world, which is very comforting for us as we look at overall Marsh. One of the things, again, when we look at this globally is number of offensive RFPs we've been competing on is now over 75%. So we're winning a lot of business and that's building the organic growth over several quarters. When we you look at the emerging economies, and so you had said about Latin America, we have to keep in mind it's one their smallest quarters, so any volatility in the renewal line will skew it in terms of its organic growth. They actually did produce more new business year-over-year and we're comfortable with the year-to-date growth rate around 12% and look at the third quarter as not consistent with how we expect them to perform but overall, we're pleased with our growth in Latin America and in Asia.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","And if I can squeeze one more in a similar topic for Mike in terms of cash U.S. versus offshore.","J. Michael Bischoff","That's a very good question. We're actually -- well, let me say that the second half of the year, we have really strong cash generation from our operating companies and you see that reflected in the $2,044,000,000 of cash that we have at the end of the third quarter, and that strong cash flow should continue through the fourth quarter. So what we typically do is start to bring money back that's not permanently invested outside the United States during the third and fourth quarter. So actually, I'm going to defer the answer to your question until we end up in the fourth quarter, and really have a definitive number with regard to how much of our cash is international versus in the U.S. And the reason that we're bringing that cash back into the U.S. over the third and fourth quarter is that you know that we have the dividend payments to shareholders. We have another return of capital in the form of share repurchase. And also, we want to look at the MMA acquisition strategy. So it's really in flux, but we started the year with almost all of our cash in international operations.","Operator","And next we'll go to Arash Soleimani with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a couple follow-ups on the exchanges. So I just wanted to confirm, the exchange in 2013, that's going to be an MMC-launched exchange, it's not going to be a partnership with a third party, is that correct?","Julio A. Portalatin","I'm sorry, I could not -- can you repeat the question please?","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. The exchange that you mentioned in 2013, that's not going to be a partnership, that's going to be an actual MMC-launched exchange?","Julio A. Portalatin","The -- okay, so there's the Mercer Health Advantage, which I already mentioned, which was already launched, right, and we do have more than one carry on that. And that was the 14 employers and 400,000 individuals, as well as family members that'll have access to that for this enrollment period that we speak of right now. And in addition to that, we will also have a Medicare partnership, so that will be a partnership, Medicare retirement partnership going soon. And then we will have an active exchange, where it'll be our exchange that we will also be announcing in the months to come.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the active exchange, I guess, what will -- in terms of the economics of that, do you expect that to be, I guess, a more lucrative business model than the traditional health benefits model in terms of switching more to a commission-based model or do you expect it to be pretty similar in terms of the margins?","Julio A. Portalatin","I mean, the -- as you -- in the U.S., which is where particularly this applies, about 50% of our business, a bit more than that is commission, the other is consultancy and quite frankly, the margins there are quite handsome and we consider that to be very consistent with what we expect from the exchange option as well.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, we saw that Aon mentioned that about 44% of their survey, I guess, clients mentioned that they were interested in potentially joining an exchange over the next 5 years. Do you find when talking to your clients that, that number seems in line with what you're seeing or...","Julio A. Portalatin","I think it's ever evolving, quite frankly. I mentioned earlier that I was in D.C. and then we had a significant amount of opportunity to be able to kind of assess that and get a ground view on some of the clients' opinions about that and there are several different points. I think that anything that works in the area of providing increased choice and controlled costs is of great interest to our clients, and it could form many different ways and many different solutions in which one of those are exchanges.","Arash Soleimani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. And do you think if the states are able, I think it's 2017, to open the exchanges to large employers, I guess greater than 100 employees, do you think in that situation they could pose a competitive threat or that would not even be an issue whatsoever if they open your doors to those?","Julio A. Portalatin","There's still a significant amount of unknowns as to how that'll all develop. It's kind of early in the game for us to really predict how that's going to turn out. So we'll leave it for the strategy that we have already articulated for the moment based on the opportunities that we see in the short and medium term.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just I know we've talked a little bit about Europe and Oliver Wyman. Just is there a way to look at year-over-year revenue change adjusted for FX in Europe, specifically Oliver Wyman, and just to try to understand kind of what that looks like on a stand-alone?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I don't think we give that information out. So I guess, the answer is no, simple. But I think we've given you a pretty good idea of how we feel about Europe from an Oliver Wyman point of view and it's -- I think it is business as usual going forward into next year. So Dan, do you want to say something?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I would just want to say that Oliver Wyman is our most fungible business model from a project-colleague engagement standpoint. So say it a different way, slowdowns in Europe can be picked up by opportunities in the United States and we can seamlessly move people to those assignments. So it's a line of -- it's a global line of business structure, so it's much more fungible than our other operating companies.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. Are you seeing kind of the pipeline shift geographically to kind of facilitate or drive the resource movement from Europe to other areas?","Brian Duperreault","John?","John P. Drzik","Well, I think that is exactly what has been happening through 2012. And as he highlighted earlier, we've had very strong growth in North America this year and faced weakened conditions in Europe. So as Dan highlights, we have a global capacity model. So we're growing overall in Oliver Wyman, so we moved its Consulting capacity from Europe to the United States to help enable the growth here and also then improve the residual economics of the European business. So overall, we really look at the business on a global basis and we manage our capacity to the global growth of the business and we can deal with variation in regional growth, region by region growth by shifting capacity. So really, Oliver Wyman's economics really follow our global revenue growth more than any bifurcation in the revenue growth by region.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one quick one on the risk side. Can you talk a little bit about in the retail side, with North America exposures and kind of trend there, what are you seeing? I know in the release, you mentioned kind of rate on the reinsurance side, but if you could talk a little about business conditions in North America, specifically on the exposure side and maybe a little comment on the rate as well, that'd be great.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Well, on the U.S. side for Marsh, again, this is the third quarter, we still saw more rate increase probably in several segments. So the property cat continued to start to trend up a little bit. You had professional lines, directors and officers focused on financial institutions started to move up. When you look at other segments like casualty, you need to break them down into different buckets, but for umbrella and lead layer casualty, we still saw some pressure on pricing. When you look at in its entirety, more of our clients experience rate increases than decreases in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter. So it was a modest increase but the trend was slightly up. In terms of the exposures, if you looked at payroll, sales, total insured values, I would say low single digits. Generally speaking, we started to see some more activity and increased payroll and start to see a little bit more in TIV, sales was modestly up, but it was low single digits.","Brian Duperreault","Okay. I think we got time for one question if there is one. Anybody?","Operator","Actually, I show we have no further questions.","Brian Duperreault","Well then, that's perfect. All right, well, I think I'm just going to say goodbye.","Operator","That concludes today's conference and we thank you for participating."],"14262":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com.","Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.","During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release.","I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Daniel Glaser","Thank you, Elaine. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations.","Since the beginning of the third quarter we have seen a heightened level of natural and man-made catastrophe losses, including major hurricanes and typhoons, earthquakes, wildfires, senseless acts of violence and disclosures of large scale cyber events.","Before we get into our third quarter results, I want to take a moment to discuss how we have been supporting our clients and colleagues, the potential market impact of these events, and the critical role that our industry plays in society. While the insurance industry has the capital strength and structural resilience to absorb these losses, the human toll has been [sobering] with significant injury and loss of life across these events. Many other individuals have been impacted through loss of homes, basic services and business interruption.","The natural catastrophes of this quarter directly impacted roughly 4000 of our colleagues across over 50 of our offices. While we are very fortunate that all of our colleagues in these affected areas are safe and accounted for, there were some who tragically lost family members and our deepest sympathies go out to them.","Catastrophes that occur in a different geographic region can seem remote and distance unless we are directly impacted as individuals. This is not the case at Marsh & McLennan. We understand the devastation and the stress that severe losses put on people and organizations. We are on the ground helping our clients recover as soon as possible.","This includes working closely with insurance companies to process claims swiftly. In these difficult times the industry pulls together to support our mutual clients. We are reminded that our industry is a noble one. While the market impact of the recent catastrophe losses is yet to be fully determined, it is important to recognize the industry had record levels of capital and capacity leading into these events.","Although the losses are significant, the impact may prove to be more of an earnings event for the industry than a capital event requiring a reloading of capital. However after several years of relatively benign activity the series of recent losses are a stark reminder of the potential loss exposures, which may cause some re-evaluation of coverage, limits and risk tolerances. While there could be some movement in pricing in catastrophe exposed areas and certain lines of coverage, the degree and sustainability of any changes remains uncertain. From our vantage point too much is unknown about how losses will ultimately develop, how capital will react or how client buying patterns will change.","Ultimately these forces will play out and the market will find its equilibrium. Right now it is just too early to tell. Insurance is about more than just protection. Industry research shows that well-insured catastrophe events end up having a shorter term impact on economic growth. In contrast, events with less insurance coverage result in a more prolonged and in some cases permanent impact to economic growth of an affected region.","Recent losses serve as a reminder of how the world is still relatively underinsured in many areas. For instance, U.S. risk such as flood, cyber and earthquake to name a few still have low insurance penetration relative to exposure and together account for just 2% of total U.S. premiums. Many factors contribute to global underinsurance or what is often referred to in the industry as the protection gap.","They include cost and affordability, understanding and acknowledgement of risks and a lack of sufficient incentives to mitigate risk and improve insurability. It will take the combined effort of carriers, brokers and governments working together to address underinsurance in the world and better access industry risk-taking capacity.","Nations and regions that have proactively addressed this protection gap are better positioned to respond and rebuild from natural catastrophes. In specific regard to flood, recent events further highlight the need for greater insurance protection and the importance for the private marketplace to play a greater role. There have been over 100,000 national flood insurance programs or NFIP claims related to Harvey and Irma. However, many of those affected lack appropriate flood coverage, and will now face these life-changing events without adequate insurance support, making the economic impact of these events meaningfully larger.","A recent article looking at FEMA data stated only about 17% of homeowners affected by Harvey have flood insurance policy. And across the U.S. only 12% of homeowners buy flood insurance according to the insurance information institute. The industry should work to encourage the private market to take on more of the underinsured or uninsured flood risk. The insurance industry can improve the understanding of risk, promote loss prevention modifications and bring more coverage into the private market obviously at appropriate pricing.","At Marsh, Guy Carpenter, and Oliver Wyman we are utilizing data and analytics to enhance modeling and increase private market participation in floods. Earlier this year, Guy Carpenter helped place $1 billion of private reinsurance coverage for the NFIP. And in December of this year, Marsh\u2019s flood platform, Torrent Technologies, is scheduled to come online as the direct service provider to the NFIP. We believe there will be opportunities for the private market to take on increased roles and we look forward to working with government and carrier partners in these ongoing efforts.","Also this quarter, Marsh\u2019s Schinnerer Group announced the acquisition of International Catastrophe Insurance Managers or ICAT, a managing general agent providing property catastrophe insurance to small businesses and homeowners across the U.S.. ICAT\u2019s focus on property catastrophe complements Schinnerer\u2019s existing services and solutions for small and middle market commercial and residential clients.","ICAT\u2019s claims and third-party administration capabilities will also provide enhanced services to our clients. The need for greater insurance protection is not limited to natural catastrophes, recent headlines related to cyber events underscore the greater need for protection in this area and we have seen continued strong growth in demand for cyber CAT programs from large global firms and cyber coverage more broadly.","The vast majority of cyber premiums relate to U.S. companies. The European General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR will go into effect in May of 2018, likely resulting in expanding demand for coverage in the EU where premium volume is low compared to the U.S.","Before turning to our results, I would like to give a brief update on the UK Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into the aviation insurance and reinsurance sector. In early October, we received a notice from the competition authorities in Brussels that the European commission has commenced a civil investigation of a number of insurance brokers including Marsh regarding the aviation insurance and reinsurance broking sector. In light of the actions taken by the European commission, the FCA informed us at the same time that it has discontinued its aviation investigation under UK competition law.","We are cooperating with the European commission and taking the matter seriously. As this investigation is at an early stage we do not intend to comment further at this time.","Now to our results. Overall we produced consolidated top line growth of 7% and underlying revenue growth of 3%. Operating income was up 4% while adjusted operating income increased 11%. EPS was $0.76, and adjusted EPS rose 14% to $0.79. And on a consolidated basis, our adjusted margin improved 70 basis points.","Through the first nine months, reported revenue growth was 5%, underlying revenue growth was 3%, and the consolidated adjusted margin expanded 70 basis points. EPS for the nine-month period grew 11% on a gap basis, and 13% on an adjusted basis. ","Looking at risk and insurance services, third-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with reported growth of 8% and underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $337 million with the margin expanding 60 basis point to 19.1%. For the nine-month period, RIS has grown revenue by 6% on a reported basis, while underlying revenue grew 3% similar to the full-year growth rates in 2015 and 2016. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion rose 10% and the adjusted margin also improved 90 basis points to 26%. ","In the consulting segment third quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing 5% on a reported basis and 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in the quarter to $330 million. The margin of 20.8% was up 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the nine-month period, consulting has grown revenue by 4% on a reported basis, while underlying revenue grew 3%. Adjusted operating income of $873 million rose 5%, and the adjusted margin increased10 basis points to 18.6%.","In summary, we are pleased with the results for the first nine months of the year. For the full year 2017 we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion across both operating segments and strong growth and adjusted EPS. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our third-quarter results were solid. Consolidated revenue increased 7%, 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 4%, while adjusted operating income was up 11% to $624 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 18.7%. GAAP EPS rose 4% to $0.76 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.79.","Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, reflecting growth of 8%, 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $337 million, with our margin expanding 60 basis points to 19.1%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $5.7 billion with growth of 6% with 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 10% to $1.5 billion with a margin of 26%, up 90 basis points.","At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 9%, with a strong contribution from acquisition activity. On an underlying basis, Marsh\u2019s revenue increased 3% in the third quarter. In U.S. and Canada, underlying revenue growth was 3% in both the third quarter and the first nine months. In the international division, underlying growth was 2% in the quarter. Latin America was up 9%, Asia-Pacific grew 7% and EMEA was down 2%. For the first nine months, international underlying revenue growth was 3% with 7% growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific and 1% growth in EMEA. ","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $270 million, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in the U.S.. Underlying revenue growth in the first nine months was also 4%.","In the Consulting segment, revenue of $1.6 billion was up 5%, 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $330 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 20.8%. As we discussed on our second quarter call, foreign exchange and acquisitions had a dampening effect on first half earnings and margins in consulting. As we expected, these headwinds lessened in the third quarter, and we continue to expect margin expansion and solid earnings growth in consulting for the full year 2017.","Mercer's revenue increased 4% in the quarter to $1.1 billion, also reflecting strong contribution from acquisition. On an underlying basis growth was flat. Overall wealth declined 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 10%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 5% largely due to lower project-based revenue. Assets under delegated management at quarter end were $213 billion, increasing 12% from the end of the second quarter. Health revenue was flat on an underlying basis in the third quarter, primarily due to softness in the U.S.. And career grew 2% with continued strong growth in our survey business and our workday offerings partly offset by a slowdown in project based consulting.","Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 8% in the quarter to $438 million. Underlying revenue growth was 7%, led by strong growth in the Middle East and Asia.","Moving to investment income, we had a loss of $2 million in the third quarter compared with less than $1 million of income in the third quarter of last year. The impact of foreign exchange on adjusted operating income in the quarter was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect a modest positive impact in the fourth quarter, which would bring us to a slight positive for the full year.","Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 26.6%, compared with 28.7% in the third quarter of last year reflecting discrete items, including the impact of the required change in accounting for equity awards. Through the first nine months, our adjusted tax rate was 26.1%, compared with 28.8% last year.","We continue to expect a 29% tax rate for the remainder of 2017 excluding any impact from discrete items. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $5.5 billion compared with $5.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, mainly reflecting lower short-term debt at quarter-end. ","The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt repayment is not until the fourth quarter of 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the [second quarter], we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through nine months, we repurchased 8 million shares for $600 million.","The third quarter marks the 22nd consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock. Since March 2014 when we announced our commitment to reduce our annual share count, shares outstanding have declined by 38 million or 7%. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, with $154 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $703 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $194 million for dividends, $309 million for acquisitions.","For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled approximately $2 billion and included $600 million for share repurchases, $545 million for dividends, and $832 million for acquisitions. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.","Year-to-date we produced 3% underlying revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, and 13% adjusted EPS growth. As Dan said, for the full year, we continue to expect underlying growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS.","And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks, Mark. Okay Elaine, we're ready to go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, I guess just following up on Dan\u2019s comments in his prepared remarks, it sounded like, I think you said this may just be an earnings event for the industry and that might not have as great of an impact on price, I guess one question is, is there a view at Marsh about \u2013 I guess what the ultimate loss might be from all of these CATs because one of the debates going around is, is it a 120 billion or is it more like a $50 billion or $60 billion event you kind of infer from some of the announcements?","Daniel Glaser","Thanks Ryan. There is a couple of things. Let me just start, and then I think I will hand over to Peter rather than John to give you a view as to the overall market and level of losses, and I can say it is going to take some time to determine the aggregate level of loss per claim and how it is ultimately distributed amongst insurance companies and also other capital providers.","What is clear so far is that the announced losses thus far are far short of the estimates provided by the modeling firms. I mean that \u2013 and that is not that different from some other catastrophes that have occurred in the past. It is just too early to tell what the ultimate losses will be. Having said that, catastrophe losses tend to get larger over time rather than smaller, but Peter do you have more to add to that?","Peter Hearn","Yes, Dan. I think Ryan, if we look at what has been \u2013 to your question, what has been reported to date is about 30 billion, and if you add FEMA into it, and you add another 20 billion on top of that for unreported to date, there is still a delta between that and what the modeled loss of 100 billion that has been thrown around.","So these are long-duration complex losses, and they take a long time to settle out. We tend to get a number set in our mind, and as Dan said, property losses have a toll on them, not as long as casualty losses, but they have a toll on them, and these will develop. And over time, I would imagine that delta will reduce.","Ryan Tunis","Yes. Just on the 4% organic in Guy Carpenter, and I guess thinking about what the normalized growth is there? Is there any way you can quantify \u2013 how you think that might have been augmented this quarter from I guess any [indiscernible] purchasing or anything like that that might have happened associated with the storms? Thanks.","Daniel Glaser","I mean a couple of things. I will hand it off to Peter in a second, but bear in mind over a long stretch of time, Guy Carpenter has been a good grower for us, and in fact, has grown underlying revenue 26 of the past 27 quarters, and we have got three consecutive quarters at 4%. It is hard to talk about what normal is, I mean, at the end it is a very segmented, specialized business, which will have its ups and downs, but certainly for us the last three quarters have been at 4%. But Peter?","Peter Hearn","Thank you Dan. I mean, Ryan, revenue from reinstatement covers as a result of Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't have a meaningful impact on our Q3 results.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks Peter. Next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, I just was hoping maybe to get a little bit more color on the pricing environment to stand to some of your comments that kicked off the call, I guess.","Maybe this is both a primary and a reentrance question but how is the dialogue following the storm going with both insurance carriers as well as your clients. As we think about some insurance companies have pointed to wait going outside of just areas impacted by losses and the reinsurance market and then if we think about the commercial lines market more broadly, some saying maybe this will have the potential to increase weight outside of just property related coverage.","So, how is the dialogue going even a way from just whether this is a $50 million to a $100 million event but how is conversations going in and around the level of rate that might come next year?","Daniel Glaser","Thanks Elyse, it's a good question. I'll take it to begin with on in overview standpoint and then I think it's good to hear from both John and Peter to get there their views of what's happening in their respective areas. But I think we have to start by saying insurance market itself is a large global and well capitalized.","And there are many insurers and other capital providers, so the market is competitive. Certain markets it's true have been hit pretty hard by these series of events and they're going to one rate increases. That doesn\u2019t mean they're going to get the rate increases they want. I mean, that's where the competitiveness of the market comes in and this is going to play out overtime.","Our job is to be on the client side of the table and to get the most comprehensive level of coverage that they're seeking at competitive terms. And so, John you want to talk about what you're seeing at Marsh so far?","John Doyle","Sure, Dan. Good morning, Elyse. Why don\u2019t I start with what we saw in the third quarter and then I can share a little bit of data in what we've seen over the course of the last few weeks. But in the third quarter, rates were down 1.6% which compares to a decline of 2.2% in the second quarter or so.","Things have been trending a little bit closer to zero over the course of the last several quarters. But I would say by major product it's a pretty type range when you look at it on a global basis. The U.K. and commonly Europe have continued to remain in those competitive markets on a price change basis.","Australia pricing for the second quarter in a row has set up. Looking ahead, insurers have certainly been communicating to us their need for increased rates given the recent cad events. Some were suggesting that the rate need for them as across the board, others have been communicating needs more focused on cad property.","As Dan said, it's really too early to tell what I can share is both over the last few weeks in property have ranged from minus five to plus 20 to plus 20 and there are no measurable impact so far in other lines at this point. Now would say in my experience will be unusual for these events that drive pricing in long tail lines.","Just maybe for a second talking about the impact of some of these price changes on Marsh, it would be mixed. On the one hand, we could see some modest uplift on pricing from commissionable premium, we'll see a little bit of more work on our claim in our claims operation as well. However it could impact had some impact on our contingent revenue primarily at MMA course.","And then we don\u2019t know a buyer bays that would be like, operating in a low growth worldwide our clients are very cost focused at the moment. We'll see whether or not particularly our larger clients to choose to retain more risk over time. Then we'll have places like markets like Porto Rico which will likely face some challenges.","Now, also why I now release that we've been expanding our capabilities in property cat, really trying to be responsive to this growing risk for our clients. Dan mentioned the acquisition of Blakestad in the second quarter or in the third quarter, excuse me, we also acquired Torrent, Dan spoke a bit about that and we created alternatives the first ever retail alternative capital facility in the second quarter or so.","We're well positioned to help our clients navigate market as we go forward.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks, John. Peter, you want to add to that?","Peter Hearn","Sure, thanks Dan. In the conversations released, we have it reinsurers as is always the takes, we ask them to take it client specific, very measured approach based on their experience, individual clients experience, exposure and their trading relationship with the reinsurers.","And preface is it's early it's too early to tell a leading indicators as to where prices is going. But that's the approach that we take, a very balanced and fair approach based on individual company, experience exposure in their trading relationships.","Daniel Glaser","Any other question, Elyse?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, thank you. And that was very thorough. I appreciate the color. In terms of the margins within RIS, the margin improvement did slow in the third quarter. And I know you guys pointed in your opening commentary that the year-to-date improvement. Was there anything that crept up in the third quarter that caused the slowdown in margins or it was just we see margins up to the year-to-date level?","Daniel Glaser","You should always look to the year-to-date or rolling 12 months or even over multiple years. I mean I were in the 10th year consecutive margin expansion and so they it's a great story considering we're not overly focused on it here at the executive table.","But the other things to think about with regard to RIS, the third quarter is our lowest revenue quarters. So, if you've got a some movement expansive would have a larger term impact. But there's nothing underlying that to point to anything that we're concerned with regard to RIS margins.","Elyse Greenspan","Much.","Daniel Glaser","Sure, next question please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Good morning and thank you. And just following up these question, the pace of margin expansion. I hope you can talk a little more about underlying drivers in term, do you see any pressure on the wages, any investment you need to make into the fitness and any cost saving opportunities within the organization.","And you have talked even past the margin expansion is a byproduct of your driving organic growth budget. I just want to understand it the better.","Mark McGivney","Sure. And what we said in the past is that margin expansion is an outcome of running a business to where almost always you expect to have revenue growth exceeding expense growth of maybe not every corner but certainly every year. And when we looked back in our history, the 35 of the past 38 quarters, we have had revenue growth that exceed expense growth.","And so, it's just a core part of the way we operate the business. When you think about things like wage pressure, it's something that we look at carefully, the reality is that our we have converted over the last number of years, more of our compensation to variable that it has been in the past.","We still have a large fixed component but the bonus pool is driven by earnings and some measure of topline growth and that drives overall accruals within our bonus pool as you can see. Our earnings has gone up multiple years in a row which if it's a little bit more flexibility when we look at compensation in general because the variable component has ridden over a number of years.","In terms of wage growth, it's interesting because in the global economy and here in the U.S. we haven\u2019t really seen that operate, so there is that economic theory about a tightening labor market ultimately playing through with wages, but I think with advances in technology and other factors and that improves efficiency that is not playing out right now.","So, there is not any built up demand for wage inflation within the company. It's something that we watch country by country very carefully. You have any other question, Kai?","Kai Pan","Yes, a follow-up just on pricing again. Is that how you position your broker colleagues in the potential changing market place. I should wonder if you can draw any comparison in the past if there is a big changes in market place, how would that impact your customer retention as well as the new business?","Daniel Glaser","Yes, a couple of things. 1) It's interesting to note in every market, that is potentially hardening and I use the word potential year. If you look around the table, you got people who have seen hard markets and soft markets. Most of our careers have been in softer softening market environments, hard markets tend to be pretty swift.","But ultimately on the underwriting side and on the booking side, we have a lot of people working for us who never experience a underwriter asking for a rate increase. You could have been in this business for decades and maybe not have ever heard those words.","So, it will play itself out. My history in the business is people convert very quickly and it's all comparative in terms of how in achieving and broking the right individual arrange for a client. I think brokers can change very quickly and adaptive to changing market conditions.","What it has meant to Marsh & McLennan in the past is generally been a higher levels, a moderately higher levels of prior retention in new business because of a slight equality. We got the broadest specialized placement capabilities in the world. And so, in times of stress, our phone rings more than in times that are easy.","Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. Could you update us on enrollment for 2018 in the private health exchange?","Daniel Glaser","Sure. Well, let me just talk a little bit about the marketplace in general because as we said before we liked our capabilities and we like our positioning and we expect Mercer marketplace 365 to be a contributor to Marsh's U.S. health and benefits business going forward.","But it's important to understand it's still in the build stage for us and its one solution just one part of an overall tool kit that we use in giving Marsh capabilities in health to clients. And so, I'm not sure if we're going to go into much detail on it. And by the way for us it\u2019s not really an exchange anymore. It's really a platform that is a year around benefits platform.","But Julio, you want to add some more to that?","Julio Portalatin","Thank you, Dan and thank you Jay for the question and good morning. Yes, we like to think of our Mercer market place 365 benefits offering as an all year around platform as Dan mentioned. It offers year round benefits like wellness along with the enrollment capability of how as well as voluntary benefits, life insurance, dental and other important coverages.","And then 365 continues to be a relatively small part of a overall broad health portfolio. Focus continuous to be in finding the right solution to bend the cost curve on health for our clients. Yet, obviously at times when that is a good fit mainly Mercer market place 365 is a good fit.","So, we continue to have confidence that we have a platform that we resonates with our client and it makes sense for some of them to take advantage of them. Mercer market place 365 had a good sales activity here this year and it will be helpful as we pivot to 2018 growth.","Daniel Glaser","So, I feel that would agree with you. I think this is one of the things Jay, that in the past we said that this part of the business was getting too much attention and we thought some of the estimates that have been put out on the industry where we couldn't understand where the numbers were coming from.","But ultimately giving things that's specific enrolment data number of lives, that sort of thing on a relatively small part of the subset of our business. This doesn't seem to make sense. So, let's just take it as Julio said they had a strong selling seasoned year which will benefit us in the future and I will leave it at that.","You have another question, Jay?","Jay Gelb","That's just fine. Sure, yes. Just a separate question on Guy Carpenter. If we look at environment where it's likely to have some pricing improvement, maybe some increased demand for property related reinsurance covers. How much of a benefit could that be for Guy Carpenter either topline and earnings if you look at past cycles like 2011, 2005?","Daniel Glaser","I mean, we one thing before I hand of to Peter. We built our business to prosper in times that are generally broad market relative level of softness in the market and then every once in a while there is a burst of activity in terms of heightening. But it certainly some of them are still brief, it's hard to refer to them as cycles, per se.","And so, that we don\u2019t look at our businesses as really operating under the basis of cycles. It's mainly almost all the way downward and then every once in a while there is a little spurt of something. And so, the other thing is both in Marsh and in Guy Carpenter, there is always a series of puts and takes in terms of how a company's responding and then I'll hand over to Peter.","But I would imagine if the market is too tough, many well capitalized insurance, we just make different decisions, right? And so Peter you want to answer that?","Peter Hearn","I think that's right. And this is a business of puts and takes. And more importantly Jay, as I said in the last call we're building Guy Carpenter and delivered consistent growth there irrespective of market conditions. That means we're focused on building strong pipelines for new business and exercising continued discipline around our client service and retention.","That we're not building a business that\u2019s depended on rate environment.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Yes, thanks. Just one question on the consulting side and then the health practice. You said there were some I guess weakness or softness in the U.S. Can you talk about what is driving that?","Daniel Glaser","Okay. So, a couple of things. You mentioned how practice and I would just -- I want to just add a little bit because I know some of our competitors actually have things that they view as they line up business. It's important to know we do a health business had made big business for us than we do it in three different places.","I mean, clearly Mercer is a cornerstone of our health business. But all of the winding either a large health practice is well that's focused on different kinds of transformation. It doesn't overlap at all with Mercer's activity. And of course both Marsh and Marsh & McLennan agency have big positions in the employee health and benefits markets.","So, it aggregates to a pretty big number and we have different ways of looking at it. But specifically I think you were referring to Mercer in this case. So, Julio why don\u2019t you talk about the Mercer health business a little bit?","Julio Portalatin","Thank you Dan and Jay thanks for the question as well. Good morning. Mercer overall has a pretty diversified and well balanced and geographically spread portfolio as you know. Over the past several quarters and several years, Mercer had delivered some pretty exceptional results in growth area.","Now on a quarterly basis, as you can imagine things that some flows and puts and takes, this is why we speak -- like to speak about our growth over a longer period this time versus a particular quarter.","In an event, let's take help as you mentioned as an example, our health business has pockets of good growth and some challenging areas, as an example our admin business which as you knows part of our health results continues to grow but go through a profitability improvement exercise which at times when contracts come up for renewal, obviously we take some pricing action sometimes they need sometimes they don\u2019t but we are very focused on improving profitability. This makes it kind of a drag in some quarters on overall health growth.","On the other hand, our commission brokers work, particularly in the U.S. remain strong with increases in retention as an example, uncertainty in the U.S. in particular has the way some decisions while others are starting to show some movement, so all that said we continue to invest in expanding our health business especially around acquisitions like content online or global proposition for health, a great platform that really is a competitive advantage for us and will pay off in the long run and of course our investments organically in most of marketplace 365.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks Julio. JD, do you have something up?","John Doyle","No, that\u2019s it. Thanks a lot guys.","Daniel Glaser","Okay, thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg","Hi, thank you. Just a quickie, I think earlier in the year you have indicated that some of the acquisitions you had done late last year were putting some pressure on margins in the first half of this year and you just needed to better scale to have those margins move up more in line with where you are. Can you just talk about that and whether there's still a bit of a drag from some of those deals that you did?","Daniel Glaser","I'll take that Larry and then I will hand over to Mark to give you a little bit more but, there was a few things Mercer in particular acquired some companies at the very tail-end of last year that were more leaning toward higher growth technology based organizations so by their very definition have a little bit more dilution to them in the early stages but we respect their higher levels of growth to make up for that over time and make them good acquisitions and so it's a little bit different than some of the other businesses that we've acquired but Mark can add to that?","Mark McGivney","Larry, in the comments we have made, we were specifically consulting business and if you remember back to the first couple of quarters, we can talk about how the underlying performance of the business which [indiscernible] was just being masked by these acquisitions. And then you start to see that as the [indiscernible] left in the back half of the year are doing well but we have had if you just look at the headline gap growth numbers acquisitions have contributing quite a bit which is a good story, the thing you keep in mind and when we talked about this the acquisitions are ahead within the near term because we're the purchase accounting through our results. We think pretty substantial growth and intangible amortization while we were delivering this solid NOI growth but as you see in the back half of the year some of the headwinds we talked about and mentioned. ","Daniel Glaser","I'm glad that Mark mentioned the GAP revenue growth because I think it's important to look like and look at, the people who look at Marsh the 9% growth for an awfully big, high quality company in a given quarter that's going to benefit us enormously in coming years, sure it's not an underlying and we want to see better underlying growth but ultimately we were happy with that number. Do we have another question, Larry?","Larry Greenberg","No, I am good. Thank you.","Daniel Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Arash Soleimani with KBW. ","Arash Soleimani","Thanks, just a start off, I have quick question, you mentioned, closing the protection gap in flood and I'm just curious to get your thoughts on how meaningful the wakeup call you think the third quarter events could serve towards starting to bridge that gap?","Daniel Glaser","It's a great question. It\u2019s a U.S. question and it\u2019s also a global question, the protection gap is meaningful if you look over decades of time, more catastrophe risk and in particular flood has been transferred to taxpayers in post event type of situation then actually insurance company through these transfer, the value that the private market bring, it\u2019s enough sure was transferred private markets with their capital risk and offer risk modification recommendations and other invitees which tend to reduce level of losses over time and it is something happens when it's a government entity that is funding on a post lost basis through taxpayer dollars and so we hope it's a wakeup call but we're not -- we're just not sure about it. ","If you look at the situation where okay pre the series of loss events, U.S. policyholder surplus was at around $725 billion which was an all time record and at the same time premium to surplus ratios were lower than they've been in the last 25 years. So we have this capital that at the right prices available to apply against risk and then on the other hand you have situations like flood in the United States which we view as the principal risk facing our clients and there's just a mismatch. So we spent a lot of time talking about it and we will see where it goes over the time but we do think there needs to be more collective energy between the entire industry, long voices so I don't think to carry much weight in any capital.","Any other questions?","Arash Soleimani","Just one other quick question, I was just curious if you have any thoughts on the potential whether there would loss adjustment expense surprised sort to speak with what the catch in the third quarter. I know I can't have a claim operation I think older claims maybe that have some inside to provide, I am just curious to get your thoughts on the last number increasing on the LAE side.","Mark McGivney","LAE, it has to be more of a percentage of overall losses as opposed to anything else and I think that there may be some stretching of adjustment expenses only because you look at a series of catastrophe and the strain that puts on organizations like loss adjustment firms, contractors etcetera the costs tend to rise as the number of them available for the next job decreases and certainly the number of claims has been close to unprecedented in a very short period of time and so that in another itself put some strain on getting the right people to do the adjustment but I would say the industry itself steps up pretty well in the event of catastrophes and there's not much quibbling that is going on, it\u2019s more of just getting the information and cutting a check and so from that standpoint I wouldn't expect no wrong drawn out process on property claims. Now on business interruption claim that\u2019s a little bit different and so maybe that becomes more of an area but that would be sort of typical of what are expense adjustments are and loss adjustments are on a post catastrophe on BI claim. So we will see much in that area.","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Styblo with Jefferies.","Dave Styblo","Hi there, good morning, thanks for the question. I just want to come back to Mercer numbers in the third quarter here; I know you guys certainly always fun to looking at a trailing base year to date in that regard I guess the flat growth here is and about the slowest in the quarter that we've seen in quite some time and some of it sounds like it's a slowdown in project based work, I'm curious if there are any other factors that cause it to be flat this quarter? I know you had mentioned your colleagues were affected to some extent so did that, was that a factor in slowing down productivity? But just generally, three of the four businesses were slower year over year and as you look forward, do you guys have visibility on some of those businesses rebounding, coming back on at this point?","Daniel Glaser","Sure, sure. No it's a good question and obviously something that we began to regulate, I would say a couple of things to start and then I will hand over to Julio, I think [indiscernible] heard over there like a comparator to last year because there was a zero in third quarter \u201916 and 4% this time and Julio may have been willing to trade on that one could Mercer was 3% in the third of 2016, so I think that has some factor there and one of the reasons why I mean these are our clients businesses that have long kind of relationships to them and so looking quarter by quarter is really not the right way to look at the business, the way I look at the business is that on a year to date basis, Marsh & McLennan Companies has had a three which is exactly where we were on a year to date basis at the consolidated company last year.","And if you recall going into this year, we sort of said our expectation was that 2017 would look a lot like 2016 and I think that has played itself out including the kind of margin expansion that we've seen in 70 BIPS [ph] year to date same as last year, year to date and when I look at the individual operating companies, I've got three operating companies up from last year and one operating company down on a year to date basis and so that that is just if I look at Marsh is at three versus a two, [indiscernible] four versus two, OW is at six versus three and Mercer is two versus a three, in the overall mix that is not an unusual year from us, we will have a different outcome on that mix each time but ultimately we rarely have all four up goes up at the same time and then there is usually some variability but Julio get, do you want add a little briefly to that?","Julio Portalatin","Yes. Thank you for the question. As I mentioned earlier on any given quarter we can have some adds and flows and puts and takes in the business. As an example when we talk a little bit about a wealth, Mercer had continue to grow earnings and new offerings in wealth business. We also continue to make acquisitions, not just in wealth but in other areas like contents online, [indiscernible] solutions which we think will serve us well on growth a well into the future.","On the wealthy area, you've heard me speak about the continued double digit growth success that we're having in our investment management delegate solutions and in fact we surpass 230 billion of assets under delegated management which further certifies our industry position.","Now in the wealth business, you also have the VB consulting actuarial business, so you have an offset in the total growth trajectory because that is a business which we all know is under pressure and it is mostly to do with the decreasing VB program and then in addition to that impact of less project work around cash out and buy out has impacted this quarter. So things like that again will be adds and flows, puts and take when everything is said and done Marsh has done a pretty good job of being able to get growth both organically and inorganic investments pointing to growth and we expect that to continue with refute.","Since we're on the consulting segment, I just want to take a moment because all of the lining while volatile, having more volatility than the other of course had been able to outgrow the other outgrows over a longer stretch of time and had a decent quarter on the topline this quarter at 7%.","But Scott, do you want to talk a little bit about growth in OW?","Scott McDonald","Sure, thanks Dan. We had a what I describe as a good quarter, with strong growth across most areas of the portfolio. It was particularly strong in the public sector or actuarial business and in our health business. We alternate really strong growth in our growth markets in particular Asia and the Middle East.","And I think we could grow even faster than this. What's held us back in the third quarter from stronger growth is Europe, still remains a little sluggish and it's a overall demand for consultant, our branding business was a little weak given the up level in global branding. And we're still managing out transition in our big financial services business from regulatory to more strategic work.","But in all three of those areas we feel some momentum, if anything market demand is picking up as global growth seems to be picking up at least modestly, and our medium term targets to have growth in mid to high single digits are fully intact.","David Styblo","Thanks, got it. That's great color on that.","Daniel Glaser","Dave, David. Yes, anything else, David?","David Styblo","I did, I don\u2019t want to beat the rates the rates earning to depth here as you guys are talking about how uncertain it is at this point. But I'm wondering maybe as a history lesson, it seems like 2005 is the most common parallel. I'm wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about the parallels or differences that you can draw from a national disaster that impacted your business back then. How they might be different or similar to the one that are affecting it now.","And I'm just trying to think of things we might not be considering such as supply of capital is a lot more robust. But are there other factors that you would point us to say \"Hey, this is what you should be thinking about as you frame the impact of the industry.\"","Daniel Glaser","I think there's just too many moving parts here, David. In fact, in your last comments in terms of the number of capital providers or the supplied capital, you think about where the market was in 2005 versus where it is in 2017. It's a completely different situation. The number of insurance companies that right more than a billion dollars of premium as an example in the United States.","The level of improvement on data and analytics, it really means that any emergent, frankly after things like KRW of alternative capital in the growth in alternative capital and other ways of companies dealing with risk transfer off of primary markets into the reinsurance market.","I mean, there are many moving parts there. I would say that certain insurance companies have been hit pretty hard. Policy holders' surplus getting wacked in the double digits and those insurance companies are going to be seeking rate. And they are going to be seeking rate probably everywhere that they issue a policy. And so, then the question becomes well what will other insurance companies do.","Will they use this opportunity as a way to slot in somewhere beneath the incumbent as a way to grow their share in this time because they may not have been heard as badly. Now, this is a global market. If you look at the top 20 insurance companies, many of them are global but it's also a local market and a regional market.","So, as John was saying earlier, the idea that in some country in Latin America or Asia, the casualty pricing will go up as a result of loss activity in the United States when there is so many regional and local champions to take the account if rates go up too high in those areas. That puts a lot of competitive pressure aware the terms of conditions will ultimately outlines that.","We love to give you more but this is where our market place operates. And the losses are still being developed as we were saying earlier, the model numbers are far higher than what the aggregate reported numbers are. So, either the modelers are incorrect right now or the actual reported numbers are too low and will rise over time which will put more pressure on rating levels.","We'll just have to see how it plays out. Next question please?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Just a couple of little simple questions, I think. I want to ask you about the discreet tax items and sort of the sustainability of those discreet items over time?","Daniel Glaser","Sure, so Mark?","Mark McGivney","Yes, sure. Paul, we've been dealing with all here. There is this required accounting change related to stock based compensation which has big impact in our first quarter which we quantified in less impact and subsequence. So, we did have a few discreet item that affected our adjusted tax rate. But that tax accounting change was the largest and it is unpredictable just based on option exercise activity and when stock based.","So, that will be something going forward. That accounting changes is permanent if you will and we will have option exercises and equity based compensation at best. But the amount of that volume is going to be a little bit volatile, depends on our stock price and when people actually take the action. That was the largest discreet item in the quarter.","Paul Newsome","Well, that makes a lot of sense. And then my second question. Just if there's any update on your thoughts about the revenue accounting change perspectively, how we should be thinking about that when we're thinking about earnings estimates for 2018?","Mark McGivney","Yes, and it's still too early to give you. First, I'd have to give a little bit of color. It is a as you can appreciate beyond our industry of the company dealing with this pretty comprehensive change to revenue recognition. And it is going to have a meaningful impact on the timing of not only our revenue recognition but the earnings pattern as well.","So, I'll give you a little bit but it won't be till later in the year when we can give you a specific. So, there will be an impact on the timing of revenue in RIS for us more so than consulting. Most of the action we expect will be across the quarters, within our year most of our contracts are fairly short term in nature.","In Guy Carpenter for instance, there'll be an acceleration of revenue and a core to share business and some of our trading business. In March we'll have some acceleration, some fee based business and a couple of other areas. But again most of the action among quarters or cross quarters within a year is opposed to the past years.","Both of our segment, there is also the element of this which I'll show you, pretty sure that involves the furl of expenses that will affect both of our segments. And in most of the impact there again would expect cross quarters within the year as opposed to cross there but there will be certain elements or categories with expense that will have amortization periods that will spend a year.","So, it is comprehensive, and as said we get through the last part of the year we'll have more specificity for you. And our goal through all of this, I mean as I said would be a meaningful change our goal be to try to provide a much transparency as possible so you can baseline the results as accurately as you can and at least get a sense of underlying performance.","Paul Newsome","I'm still wondering if this is something what we do talking about in December right before we get into the earnings announcements or if you look come earlier than that. Just from a mechanical perspective and setting expectations for quarters.","Mark McGivney","Yes. I think at this point forward, still uncertain I mean certainly between now in our Q4 earnings call we like we will not say anything.","A - Daniel Glaser","Okay, well. I'd like to draw the call to a close and thank everybody on the call this morning for joining us today. I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication and serving them. Have a good day everyone. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"14261":["Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.

Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, very much. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I would like to thank Peter Zaffino for his many contributions to both Marsh and Guy Carpenter over his 15 plus years with the company. We wish Peter continued success and look forward to working with him as he moves on to the next phase of his career.","Marsh & McLennan has a deep bench of leadership talent. We are constantly looking to invest and add capabilities to our organization. Talent is a key area of focus in this regard, and we were both opportunistic and strategic when we acquired talent. Last year, we added John Doyle and Peter Hearn to our organization, two experienced and highly regarded industry executes.","I've worked with John for almost 20 years, and I can tell you that his transition into the Marsh's CEO role will be seamless. Over the past year, he's been a key part of setting strategy as President of Marsh, as well as being a member of the MMC Executive Committee. John has more than 30 years of insurance industry experience and provides a thoughtful perspective on the future of our industry and potential growth opportunities. He has a proven track record of strong leadership, success in building client relationships, and inspiring colleagues. Since he joined Marsh, John has been heavily focused on client service and retention, and these will continue to be key areas of emphasis going forward.","I'm also happy to have Peter Hearn, the CEO of Guy Carpenter, joined the MMC Executive Committee. Over the past year, his leadership has had a meaningful impact on Guy Carpenter's already strong record of performance. Throughout their carriers, John and Peter have built strong relationships across the insurance value chain. While both have led successful large organizations, I believe their enthusiasm for improving the client experience sets them apart, and will benefit overall growth going forward.","In addition, Julio and Scott continue to demonstrate tremendous leadership and have delivered impressive results at Mercer and Oliver Wyman. With these operating company heads, combined with the rest of our Executive Committee, I believe, we have the strongest leadership team in the industry. That said, the performance of our company goes well beyond senior management. Our success is driven by strong teams throughout the firm executing and making decisions where they matter most, close to our clients.","While we invest for the future, we continue to emphasize the basics, delivering for clients every day, adding value and pursuing new opportunities with the sense of urgency and passion. We continue to invest in technology, digital, data and analytics to drive innovation and faster growth. In this regard, we've had several important announcements since last quarter, Mercer recently launched Mercer Digital an integrated business across health, wealth and career to better leverage the digital capabilities that have been built in the organization. Our data and technology combined with specialized Consulting expertise positions Mercer Digital to help organization's transition to a digital future while ensuring their work force thrives.","As part of this initiative, Mercer announced Rohit Mehrotra will be taking a new role as CEO of Mercer Digital. Rohit came to MMC when we bought his fifth startup CPSG, that acquisition has performed well for us and we are pleased that he is taking a broader role in Mercer. Earlier this month, Mercer also announced an equity investment in PayScale a cloud based provider of compensation management software and real time salary data. Together, we will collaborate on new innovative compensation and workforce data products and solutions.","Another important announcement was Marsh's hire of Sastry Durvasula as Chief Digital Officer and Chief Data and Analytics Officer. Sastry brings an in-depth knowledge of digital technologies and will oversee the strategic design, development and delivery of digital capabilities, data and analytics and client-facing technology. We also continue to broaden our participation in the technology and innovation landscape. For example, we recently added to our relationship with the private equity firm, Aquiline Capital Partners, by participating as one of the anchor investors in a new fund focused on early stage technology companies in insurance, as well as asset management, retirement and benefits.","We will continue to invest capital to shift our mix of business to faster growing segments and geographies. These are just examples of some of the numerous partnerships, investments and strategic initiatives underway across our organization to position ourselves to thrive and shape the future.","We talk about balance in many aspects of our strategy and philosophy. And the events of this quarter highlight another dimension of balance in how we operate MMC. While we continue to innovate and position for future long term growth, we remain focused on delivering today. This requires rigorous attention to the fundamentals and maintaining focus on the client. Technology advancements, increasing complexity and the pace of change in the world, represent significant challenges for our clients to address in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We are uniquely positioned to support them and help them succeed.","Now let's turn to some highlights of our results. Our second quarter performance was solid and in line with our expectations. We produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3% with growth across all four operating companies. Operating income was up 5%, while adjusted operating income increased 7%. EPS was $0.96, up 7% and adjusted EPS rose 10% to $1.","And on a consolidated basis, the adjusted operating margin improved 70 basis points. For the six months, underlying revenue growth was 3% and the consolidated adjusted margin expanded 70 basis points. EPS for the six month period grew 13% on a GAAP basis and 14% on an adjusted basis.","Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $535 million, with our margin expanding 110 basis points to 27.9%, the highest second quarter margin in 30 years. For the six month period, underlying revenue grew 3%, similar to the full year growth rate in 2015 and 2016. Adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion rose 10% and the adjusted margin also improved 110 basis points to 29.1%.","In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 3% in the quarter to $298 million. The margin of 18.7% was flat with the prior year. Similar to the first quarter, recent M&A activity impacted earnings. We anticipate improvement as the year progresses and expect Consulting to deliver solid earnings growth and margin expansion for 2017.","In summary, we are pleased with the results for the first half of the year. For the full year 2017, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past seven years, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark Christopher McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we delivered solid results driven by underlying revenue growth across all four of our operating companies. Overall, revenue was up 4% or 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 5%, while adjusted operating income was up 7% to $788 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 22.5%. GAAP EPS rose 7% to $0.96 and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.","Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $535 million, with our margin expanding 110 basis points to 27.9%. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $3.9 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 10% to $1.1 billion with a margin of 29.1% also up 110 basis points.","At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 4%, with acquisition activity over the last 12 months continuing to contribute to overall growth. As we expected, underlying revenue growth of 2% in second quarter was tempered following the strong underlying growth of 5% in the first quarter.","As we've said in the past, we think it is more appropriate to look at underlying revenue trends over a longer period of time. For the first six months, as well as the trailing 12 months, Marsh's underlying growth was 3%. The international division underlying growth was 1% in the second quarter. EMEA revenue was flat, Asia-Pacific rose 3%, and Latin America grew 4%. For the first six months, international underlying revenue growth was 3%. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 2% in the quarter and was 3% for the first six months. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $293 million, an increase of 3%, or 4% on an underlying basis, representing another strong quarter for Guy Carpenter. It was better we had expected.","Strength in underlying revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based, reflecting growth in North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, as well as increased demand for retrocessional reinsurance. Underlying revenue growth for the first six months was also 4%, while underlying growth over the trailing 12 months was 3%.","In the Consulting segment, revenue of $1.6 billion was up 3%, or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to $298 million, while the margin held constant at 18.7%. Similar to the first quarter, active M&A in Mercer at the end of last year and foreign exchange were headwinds to Consulting earnings growth. However, underlying results remain strong and we continue to expect solid operating earnings improvement and margin expansion in Consulting for the full year 2017.","Mercer's revenue increased 3% in the quarter to $1.1 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis. Within Wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 11%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 3%. Overall Wealth grew 1% in the quarter. Assets under delegated management at quarter end were $191 billion, increasing 8% over the first quarter and 30% year-over-year. Health increased 3%, with solid growth in North America and Latin America. Career underlying growth was 5% with strong growth in surveys and our consulting around workday implementation.","Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 5% in the quarter to $483 million. Underlying growth was 7%, representing another solid performance led by strong growth in the United States, Asia, and the Middle East.","Investment income was $5 million compared with $1 million in the second quarter of last year. We expect the contribution from investment income will be de minimis for the remainder of 2017. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a slight headwind to NOI, with a negative impact in Consulting, partially offset by a small positive in RIS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect minimal impact to NOI from FX for the remainder of the year.","Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 28.6%, compared with 29.1% in the second quarter of last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 25.9%, compared with 28.8% last year. The year-to-date tax rate in 2017 includes the impact of the required change in accounting for equity awards, which had a significant impact on our rate in the first quarter.","We continue to expect a 29% tax rate for the remainder of 2017 excluding any impact from discrete items. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $5.6 billion compared with $5.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, reflecting the repayment of $250 million of senior notes on April 1.","The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt repayment is not until the fourth quarter of 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through six months, the company has repurchased 5.4 million shares for $400 million.","Second quarter marks the 21st consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 36 million or 7%. Our cash position at end of the second quarter was $966 million, with approximately $118 million in the United States. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $442 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $176 million for dividends and $66 million for acquisitions.","For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.3 billion and included $400 million for share repurchases, $351 million for dividends, and $523 million for acquisitions. In May, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.34 to $0.375 per share. For the full year 2017, we expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.","First half of 2017 represents a strong start to the year with 3% underlying revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 14% adjusted EPS growth. As Dan said, for the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS.","With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're ready to go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We're going to go to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning. First, congratulations to John for the new position. I'm wondering, for John, if you could about more, about your strategic focus at Marsh? And how do you tie that with the current market condition in term P&C pricing?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Kai. It's Dan, I'll just start a little bit by saying how thrilled I am that John is part of the team. And as you know, over the last several years, Marsh is doing well, so it's not crying out for massive amounts of change. But having said that, every business can be improved of \u2013 and I'm sure John will put his own mark on the organization and I'm looking forward to seeing the further developments as we go forward. But John, do you want to add a little bit of flavor to that?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC","Sure. Good morning, Kai and thank you. I guess, so I'd start by saying that I spent a lot of time with Dan and Peter to make sure that we were aligned on strategy before I join the team. I would also note that I was quite involved in the plan that we presented to the MMC board of directors last fall, so I wouldn't anticipate any major changes to this strategy. I do want us to operate in a more simple and agile way, so take a look at our org structure and I want us to do with the highest professional standards.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah, thanks, John. So, basically some structural changes, some simplification and some emphasis on the client experience and client initiatives around retention. You have anything else, Kai?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. And just follow-up on that. You talk about the current market condition, because some said that the pricing is stabilizing and some said, it become increasing more competitive. How do you see that from your perspective and then you've had headwind or tailwind to your business and seems like, there is a little bit slowing down in organic growth in brokerage segments for this quarter but if you look at like the first half, probably still in your range. I just wondering, is the pricing \u2013 well, pricing continue to be putting some pressure on the organic growth in brokerage? Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Well, I think that pricing has put pressure on organic growth across the businesses for number of years now. I wouldn't look at the second quarter as being the start of the new trend driven by price or premium reductions. As you were just saying yourself, yeah, looking at the first half of the year, Marsh was at a 3%, which is consistent with where they were last year and the year before and so that's probably a more appropriate way to look at that. But what do you see in rates and premium, Scott?","Scott McDonald - Oliver Wyman Group","So there is no meaningful change in pricing in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of the year, overall rates declined a bit more than 2%.","UK rates under a bit more pressure where the decline was in the 4% range. We did observe some modest increases in some classes of business and at some territories, commercial auto for example. Australia saw some modest increases in the quarter. So we did observe that. But we expect the market to remain competitive overall.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Scott. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, so it seems like there was a bit of an organic revenue shift from the second to the first quarter which is why you guys kind of gearing us towards the half year one numbers. I'm just interested, is this something that we should think about or thinking about the second half of the year and I guess this kind of impacted both your U.S. and international business. Just any more color that you can just kind of give just in terms of the timing shift throughout the different businesses. And if you could also just let us know how the growth within the MMA was in the quarter and for the first half of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. So a couple of things. I wouldn't overemphasize shifts of business, I mean clearly some things move around quarter-by-quarter, I wouldn't take too much into it. As we've said a couple of times and as we've done over the last few years, the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter usually is a bit stronger for us on an overall business basis, so I will look at it that way. We're happy with our first half results in general, not only on a growth basis, but also we're getting growth from acquisitions, some of which we're giving up in FX, but there is growth in acquisitions which is going to benefit us in future years.","We like the fact that our adjusted operating income was reasonably well up given the growth rate and as well as EPS, margin expansion hit our expectations. So overall, we're happy with the first six months and we're looking forward to the next six months. In terms of MMA, we don't breakout MMA other than to say they had a nice quarter and the basic thing that we said all the way starting back in 2009 was that we expected MMA to be able to outgrow Marsh and all I'll say is that, yes, they have been doing that and they did it in the second quarter as well.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question, you guys saw 110 basis points of margin expansion in RIS Q2 and the first half of the year. I know last quarter you guys had said maybe margins would be a bit tempered, just the Q2 was pretty strong in that regard. Can you just comment on without giving exact numbers just your forward outlook on the margin view there and just initiatives that you're working on within both Marsh and Guy Carpenter to continue to be able to manage your expense base and improve your margins there?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. And generally, I mean when I look at the RIS segment, we're in a pretty modest GDP world with basic rate levels in the P&C sector in almost all geographies and in almost all lines of business going down. Now going down may be at pace, it's not quite as steep as it was last year, but it's still going down.","And so when I speak about margins, one way to look at it is, we would have liked to grow Marsh more in the second quarter than we did and operate expense controls throughout the year and recognizing that we are in this kind of lower growth environment and so that's the one of the reasons why the margin may have passed a little bit more than what we originally expected because we would have thought that we could have grown a little bit more than 2%, and we're pretty comfortable that 2% is not the new reality, but that we will have quarters, every once in a while, that look like that. Just like we'll have some quarters every once in a while like last quarter where Marsh grew 5%. It didn't make 5% the new world, 2% is not necessarily the new world either. And so, our expense controls tend to be multi-quarter, right, even a multi-year, and so there is \u2013 that's why the margin may move around a little bit.","Operator","We'll go to our next question with Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, and thank you. Dan, just wondering, if you can talk about \u2013 I don't know, it was mentioned in one of the publications this quarter, that you're starting kind of in an alternative capital backed facility for retail property, casualty, I think the name of it was Alternus, can you just give us some color on that?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I'll do a little and then I'll hand off to John to give you a little bit more. But basically it's not property and casualty, it is property. And basically the way to look at it is, there is a major insurance company Allianz that had always wanted to participate in a more significant way in United States property, but they were \u2013 they felt they had enough cash. And so that was an inhibitor of greater levels of participations.","And Marsh very creatively sought through, well, how can we marry up their appetite with alternative capital, and sought alternative capital using a high degree of Marsh data and Marsh analytics to create more of a portfolio look to the property portfolio that Marsh has. And that was a combination between Allianz and Nephila, which at the end result means that they're willing to write virtually every property account of Marsh and they're willing to write that at a guaranteed discount to the client of 7.5% off of any other markets pricing for the balance of the placement. And so it's clearly a win for the client, it's a win for the market because that certainly bringing a market like Allianz to the forefront with alternative capital backing is a big positive and it's another example of Marsh innovation. Now I haven't checked in lately as to how often this is doing et cetera. But, John, do you want to add something to that?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC","As you mentioned that we announced it in April, so it's still relatively early but the take-up rate so far has been positive. The feedback we've gotten from our clients has been positive as well, so more efficient solution for our large property clients. So we think it's a great way where Marsh can bring better value to our clients than we had before.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Anything else, Larry?","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yeah. Any update on the FSA (sic) [FCA] investigation and I guess, does it mean anything that the PRA is now looking at facilities?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Well, a couple of things. No, there's no update in terms of the FCA that that investigation is ongoing and we're cooperating fully. We imagine it will take quite a while for them to work through their analysis and come to some sort of determinations, but it's really all that I'll say on that at that time. Now in terms of the FCA review of the wholesale market, they do that on a periodic basis. And I don't see any connectivity between the FCA review which may entail a review of facilities as well as \u2013 with the investigation that's going on in the aviation sector.","Operator","And we'll next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a question for Dan, on \u2013 thinking about the relationship between margins and an organic growth. So the emphasis, I hear your views on the stability of organic within Marsh, how it's been 3% pretty much year-to-date. It's been like that in 2015, 2016. And if we would've gone back to 2015 when it was at 3% \u2013 we talked about the headwinds \u2013 we might not have thought it was going to stay at 3%. But I think if we knew it was going to be at 3%, we probably wouldn't have thought you would have expanded margins by 2 to 3 points. So I guess, what I'm wondering is, has kind of the fundamental equation changed about what gets you margin expansion, do you still need well in excess of 3% over time? Or I guess, another way to ask it is, under what conditions would margins not expand going forward what you've been able to deliver with just 3% organic growth?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","It's a good question, and it's something that we wrestle with as a leadership team. I mean, at the end, clearly, we are finding ways to operate the business in a more efficient manner and improve our productivity over time. And we've done that for a number of years. I mean, just to remind everyone, we're in the \u2013 2017 is our 10th year of margin expansion. And this hasn't been a little bit of expansion. This has been significant consistent levels of expansion over time.","We are in a more for less business. Our job is to deliver more value to our clients every year at fundamentally better levels of efficiency within our own organization. So that search for a smarter way, that search for additional operational efficiency, that never ends. And when I look into the future, whether it's robotics, whether it's deep learning, AI, et cetera, I think there'll be all kinds of avenues for us to become a more efficient organization as we go forward. So, I don't think the margin story is different.","Now, do I think the margin will expand typically more when we have a better top line than 3%? Yes. Do I think that 13% adjusted EPS growth over the long term will be far easier to achieve with a better top line? Yes. So, we are doing everything possible to position the company through mix of business, through acquisition strategy, through organic investment on an ongoing basis to spur growth into the future regardless of market conditions, because our anticipation is the market's going to be similar to where it is today. And so, and anything to the upside, I think, would be a benefit to us.","In terms of margins, in general, I can tell you, when we're around the leadership table, margin doesn't come up. Earnings growth comes up, revenue growth comes up, acquisitions come up, but actually, we think that margin expansion is not a strategy per se, it's an outcome of how we run the business properly. And really, one of the core philosophies of the company is that revenue growth should exceed expense growth almost every quarter and certainly every year. And so, when we look at it on that basis, it's just a natural outcome.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much for the answer.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Anything else, Ryan?","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dan, I'd like to come back to sort of the lead in that you came up with in terms of the technology and digital investments and hires that you made. And I'm just curious to hear a little bit more about the genesis of that. I'm sure it's been incubating in your minds for quite some time. But are these strategic initiatives something that you've been hearing clients ask for? And so it's a little bit more a response from that or is it something that you just think can help out with better retention and new wins or maybe some sort of a combination of both or other factors?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And maybe, it's a great question and no, it's not a client response, although it is definitely the clients at the table in our discussions and thinking through it as to how we can improve the client experience. A factor of me being in the business for more than 35 years is I've seen other changes. As an example, I remember when companies thought that email was a proprietary value, or I remember when people were asked about well what is their Internet strategy, or actually in the beginning, what was your world wide web strategy, okay. So, ultimately the way I look at it is, all companies that expect to be successful in the future will be digital on some basis or another.","And so, I don't believe that this is necessarily a next year thing. I think we're positioning the company to be successful long into the future. When we consider digital, we really look across three dimensions. It's not just about growth, it's about growth, operational efficiency and clearly people who work for our organization. And so, in terms of growth, it's really about the client experience and the robustness of our offerings and some of our acquisition strategy. So, you look at Thomsons or PayScale Equity Investment or Torrent or Dovetail. They're one way or the other all digital players. If you look at Mercer 365, it's a technology play, it's a user experience play.","In terms of efficiency, we are beginning to experiment. Now I would emphasize experiment. You're not going to see early term results for bots or robotics, automation, machine learning, that kind of stuff. Although there are parts of our business where we will increasingly look to utilize that kind of capability and see how we can become more efficient. And in terms of people, I mean, Sastry and Rohit are just two examples. There's many others of how we're adding new skills to the organization and we're hiring more data scientists, more developers and this is going to be an ongoing process. But I just wanted to highlight that for us, the battle has been joined.","David Anthony Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Maybe just a little bit more on some of the results for the quarter. So, on reinsurance, you guys had another really strong quarter again, impressive at 4%, and just was trying to get a better sense on the macro conditions right now. Are you guys continuing to see the pricing environment declines become less of a headwind? Let me start there.","And then kind of more forward-looking, and kind of canvassing, it looks like there were a few reinsurance contract losses that I believe mostly start in the second half, couple in Florida with People's Trust and Capitol Preferred and then also with Argo. I think, all three of those went to the same competitor, so that being the case, are you guys starting to see any sort of irrational competitor pricing behavior or are there other reasons you can point to for that? Or again I'm sure there's always pluses and minuses in every quarter and is this just sort of a sample or is this something that seems to be a little bit more pointed this quarter rather than in prior quarters?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure, sure. So I'll start and then I'll hand off to Peter. One, I could say that that we're really as an organization very pleased with Guy Carpenter and that's not a short-term phenomena. Guy Carpenter has grown underlying revenue 25 over the last 26 quarters, best-in-class growth by far. And ultimately has built some share and wins a lot more than it loses. And so from that standpoint, we're proud of the organization. And we're very excited about adding somebody like Peter to the mix, top tier, reinsurance executive, seasoned, smell of the market on them and so I expect if that Guy Carpenter will continue to perform super well relative to its peer group over a long stretch of time of Peter. With that lead up what could you possibly say?","Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC","I think I smell pretty good. David, a couple of things, with regard to pricing, there still remains modest headwinds, we're seeing some flattening of pricing on casualty side, on the property side, and the life side, and accident side, there's still fairly aggressive pricing both in the traditional and in the alternative capital markets. With regards to the loss of business, we have an incredibly high retention ratio within Guy Carpenter. Having said that, it is incumbent upon us to build a very strong robust and disciplined production platform in the event that we do in fact lose business that we can replace it quickly, and we do that.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you. Thank you. Next question, operator.","Operator","We'll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks and good morning.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","With regard to Consulting, the expectation in earnings growth would improve in the back half because of less of a drag from client, merger activity, is double-digit operating growth in the back half, the reasonable expectation?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah, a couple of things, one, it's not the acquisitions of clients that is impacting their top or bottom line, it's really acquisitions that Mercer made really in December that has created a short-term hiccup to earnings and an impact on margins. And so, that will sought itself out as growth begins to come in. And so, it's really \u2013 it's not \u2013 I mean, at the end, we think that there's been pretty consistent strong levels of growth both in our Oliver Wyman and Mercer. And when we look at the back half of the year, we really don't give margin expectations or operating income expectations. We do believe we'll have solid earnings growth in Consulting for the year and we will have margin expansion for the year.","Now, what that is, I mean, at the end, when I look at Consulting's margins, I mean, in the last five years, they're up 680 basis points. And so given the first half of the year, I don't think you can have a dramatic increase in margins consistent with 680 basis points over a five year period. But having said that, we do expect to see margin expansion in the back half.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful, Dan. And then with regard to RIS, it would seem that earnings growth \u2013 the earnings growth rate will probably need to be higher in the back half than it was in the first half for RIS to achieve your full year EPS growth goal. Am I on track for that as well?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I mean, overall, we do \u2013 we expect the company, particularly, building momentum through the back half of the year with usually a stronger fourth and third, but we don't really have an annual goal with regard to adjusted EPS or margin expansion. We expect this to be a good solid year. I mean, when I \u2013 when we started the year, I was asked the question about 2017 versus 2016 in the macro environment and I pretty much said I thought 2017 look a lot like 2016 and still believe that is kind of the case. We're still in that kind of environment.","Generally slow growth around the world at least modest level of growth, some P&C headwinds, low interest rates, business confidence that descent but fluctuates with the geopolitical cycle. So we're in \u2013 we remain in the grinded out years and we expect to have good performance in that. But we don't expect it to be one of these knock your lights out kind of thing, I mean I know that we've grown I think 14% adjusted EPS through the first six months. But really if you back out the accounting benefit of \u2013 on the compensation change is really 9%. And so I think in \u2013 we feel comfortable with that kind of level, at the level of growth that we're performing in the first half. We're expecting a little bit better in the second half and we're happy that we're now in it.","Operator","We'll go to our next question with Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you very much. In the new presentation of segmenting, you've added more disclosure on Consulting segment. And the Defined Benefit segment obviously was a outlier with a negative 3% growth. Can we talk about whether that's a lumpy business in general, whether you're existing low margin businesses or how should we think about that. And can you go a little bit into detail on what's in that Defined Benefit and Administration, Consulting practice?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah, I'll hand over to Julio in a second. But the Defined Benefit business, it's a terrific business, but it's not a growth business. If you think about is there a new Defined Benefit formation with companies and startups, et cetera, no. I mean basically companies today in almost every market not exclusively but certainly in the United States and in other major markets, lean heavily in the favor of Defined Contribution over Defined Benefit. And Mercer has done a really wonderful job over a number of years extracting value from our Defined Benefit practice. And \u2013 but Julio, you want to give us some more on that?","Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Dan. DBA which is the sub-segment that you're referring to is comprised primarily of our advisory and administrative services around Defined Benefit plans. And as Dan mentioned and everyone is very well aware, Defined Benefit plans are on the decreased growth many years. And while a number of plans have contracted over that time period, we have continued to maintain growth by capturing discretionary spend from advising clients to their de-risking journey.","We continued to expect that clients from time-to-time, as we'll make decisions to de-risk further and we'll get some benefit from there because we are certainly leading in that space when you compare us to others in the industry. But quarter-over-quarter variances are going to happen, as we always know and depending about what our (44:20) project demand looks like such as buy-outs, cash-outs or regulatory changes, they will vacillate and that will continue to be the case.","I do want to point to just one additional factor though is that we did do a restructuring that brought the wealth business together that has the Defined now in a continuum that's very important to our clients that can lead to investment consultancy opportunities as well as investment management opportunities and you saw that a little bit displayed already in that quarter when saw an 11% increase in our investment management.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Do you have anything else, Josh?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, and I'm not trying to get guidance, but just to parse your words, would it be wrong for me to think of this over the long term as a sub-zero organic growth business?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Well, okay, define the long term. I mean clearly Defined Benefit and pension plans have a long way to run, right. These are 25 to 50 year programs as people live longer as how they operate. So, it is not a quickly declining business, and we've had many times where we have grown, but largely the growth tends to be project related work as opposed to growth in the basic business. So I would put in a category of low levels of negative growth or low levels of positive growth quarter-by-quarter but on a declining trend.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the education. Appreciate it.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, most of my questions have been addressed. Just one last quick one. Latin America, the growth in the quarter was the slowest you've seen in a long time, I'm wondering what's happening in that market, was there anything unusual in the quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","There were a couple of unusual things, but John, you want to talk about that?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC","Yeah, look I think, Jay, the growth was acceptable given the volatility in the region, so we saw some ups and downs by country, we had strong results in Mexico, and I think solid results in Brazil, especially given the environment there. New business wasn't that strong, I think in part due to some of the volatility and we had some pretty strong prior year comps as well. So, weather impacted a bit of some project starts and that had an impact on new business, but broadly speaking it's \u2013 I think decent results through six months given the overall environment.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Focus more on the six month number as the message has been?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. That's right. I mean the Latin America is still critical market for us, when we look over a multiyear basis, it's been our fastest growing region. We don't break out geographies, but Consulting had a decent quarter in Latin America, so there is nothing fundamentally wrong. There is a \u2013 obviously there is a number of issues that individual countries are working through, but we like our positioning in Latin America, we would expect that it would return to better growth patterns in the future.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","We'll go next to Arash Soleimani with KBW.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks and good morning.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just a quick question on \u2013 we hear a lot on the cyber market, their estimates out there, where premiums would go from $3 billion to $30 billion by 2020, I'm just wondering if broadly you're seeing your clients' appetites increase such that a growth level of that magnitude seems feasible.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I don't think we're going to comment on the growth level, whether it's going to go up 10 times in the next 10 years, I think all you guys have had the experience of the exchanges to think about before we start hitting 10 times growth on any part of any of our Consulting or Risk businesses. Clearly cyber is here to stay, and around the world, tax are becoming more advanced, and therefore defenses have to be more advanced, and insurance is a good \u2013 is basically for a lot of companies, it's a package of yes, you get some risk transferred, but you also get some comparative considerations as capital providers seeking to project their capital are able to advise on best practices and some of the things that they're seeing with otherwise competing markets.","And so, from that standpoint, there is a risk management quality to the insurance offering that is very beneficial to clients. And as you see around the world higher levels of disclosure requirements on breaches, I think you'll end up seeing insurance being one of the mitigants to that, but John, do you want to talk about our cyber practice a bit and what we're seeing?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh LLC","Sure, cyber risk is clearly on top of minds of our clients and has been for a number of years here in the United States and I think given some of the regulatory changes that Dan mentioned, is increasingly on top of mind for our clients outside of the U.S. So we've been adding staff and expertise and developing partnerships with firms that again go beyond insurance procurement and help them manage the risk more broadly. So it's a pretty fast growing part of our business, at a healthy growth rate, of more scale certainly here in the U.S. and relatively small and subscale outside of the United States, but we expect that to change.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah, one thing I was looking at recently and which I find interesting anyway, because you hear a lot about the insurance market, and many companies just sort of dipping their toe into cyber and concerns about accumulation risk and cyber hurricane et cetera. So let's take your $3 billion premium level, and say what's a typical rate online for cyber, it typically is less than 1%. So if you just run the math on that, there are something like $300 billion of limit that has been provided against that $3 billion of premium and in that context there is no dipping the toe in the water. There are many markets in cyber in a significant way and it's probably the growth opportunity in property and casualty.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks for those very thorough responses. Just also one other question maybe for Peter. I know Florida has been a weak spot in terms of rates on the reinsurance side. I'm just wondering, has the assignment of benefits crisis been factored into the pricing conversations at all and do you see reinsurers getting any more pricing power from the assignment of benefits crisis or is it not really a factor?","Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC","It's not really a factor because it's an attritional loss, it's not a catastrophic loss and most of the reinsurance in Florida is catastrophic based and not risk and attritional based.","Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just maybe to follow up a bit on the topic of commercial insurance prices. You had mentioned the pace of commercial P&C insurance price declines have slowed a bit. Do you see any signs that that could turn positive in the next few years?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I mean rates are geared against losses in competitive environment. There is lots of capital providers, lots of insurance companies, so there will always be some downward pressure. There's better management teams, better data and analytics and so there is not na\u00efve underwriting like you may have seen in the 1980s or 1990s. And so there is probably a tighter range of outcomes, but it really depends on loss activity. If the loss activity comes in, it will put pressure on rates.","We are seeing on the reinsurance side some slowing down, or harder to place lines of business and certainly not anything approaching a hard market in any way, shape or form on reinsurance. And usually you see reinsurance tighten before primary tightens. And so we've got a way to go here before we see that. I mean when we look at the last let's say year, maybe even two years, the UK market and the London market in particular has the deepest downdrafts in rating levels and so that is the most competitive market in the world from a price reduction standpoint. And so it's a tough place to do business these days.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Anything else, Sarah?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Two questions here for you. First one, just on the reinsurance side, we've seen a big increase in issues of cat bonds this year. How much of a tailwind has GC Securities been to Guy Carpenter this year? And could that be an issue potentially as we look at next year on comps?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Peter, you want to take that? So basically to rephrase it, it's like, is cat bonds volume fueling 4%.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC","Brian, it helps, but it hasn't been a major contributor. It's been pretty consistent in the amount of issuances that we've been involved with over the past three years.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. So you haven't seen growth like the rest of the cat bond market, because cat bond market is up pretty substantially this year?","Peter C. Hearn - Guy Carpenter & Co. LLC","Well, there have been 25 cat bonds; we've placed 8, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past three years.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, Dan, my next question for you, and I imagine your regulators are pretty busy over in the UK. There's been a lot of press also on the consulting side with respect to investment consultants and the FCA report. How much is that from a revenue perspective for you guys? And any color you can add into that situation.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Well, just a little bit. One, it's an overall review of a marketplace and the dynamics of a marketplace. Then it's started out broadly on asset management including investment consultants and now it's narrowed a little bit to investment consultants in the level of concentration that there are with the largest investment consultants and what that pertains to and the potential conflicts that that could arise from that. And so, we're very much cooperating with the review, and it's obviously an important business to us, both investment consulting and investment management on a delegated basis. But, Julio, you want to talk a little bit about our business?","Julio A. Portalatin - Mercer Investment Management, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, our business has been a flagship business in that part of the world, and we anticipate that it will continue to be. We have great expertise in the space and of course, we are cooperating fully with the FCA, because we share their goals. Their goals are to ensure that we have a competitive marketplace, it's transparency that we avoid any conflicts, and then we overall maintain high standards.","And that's kind of our goals, and that's how we operate in that market. And we'll continue to operate in that market in years to come. And so, now the FCA is in a determination stage, and we'll see how it goes, but wherever it goes we'll continue to cooperate, of course with them. And hopefully, give them the opportunity to also take some of our best practices and apply to the rest of the industry.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Julio. So I think we have time, operator, for one more question.","Operator","Okay. And we'll go to Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. The acquisitions that you did decent amount towards the end of the year, what does the pipeline look like right now?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","The acquisition pipeline is good. I mean we are \u2013 we look at a lot of different things, not from a detailed due diligence basis. So we've got good peripheral vision, we're live in the marketplace, so we'd have a good look across both RIS and Consulting. And I would say when we look at our pipeline, looks pretty good. We over the last three years, have spent about $1 billion in transaction value per year. It's too early to say, it's only through the first six months we've had a pretty active first six months of the year and where we look at our pipeline. And a lot these things take a long time in terms of gestation period. But so when I look at the pipeline now, this year looks pretty good and it even looks pretty good next year. We've I'm sure certain things that we're looking on right now, would take a little bit longer time.","Our focus is generally on faster growing businesses and businesses that can improve our capabilities. Wouldn't mind every once in a while seems something right up the alley of our strong suit where we get some synergy and some decent earnings growth out of it through some expense saves, but our overall acquisition strategy is geared towards faster growing businesses.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","On that P&C side, would you ever go back in the wholesale business?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Well, I don't know if there is a wholesale business anymore. I mean, clearly there is specialty placement businesses that have done quite well and they're good businesses. If you ask me if I would have preferred that we didn't exit that kind of specialty placement business. Yeah, the answer would be, I would prefer that we would have been still in that business, but when we go back in, it's a different kind of question. I mean I think they've done a very nice job, there is some good companies out there, but we're an awfully big company and we would have wanted to do something in a real minor way on an a structural basis like that. But fundamentally, we look at the wholesale business, so called wholesale business and we think they've done a nice job building out their specialties and their capabilities over a long period of time.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Glaser, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, Mindy. And I'd like to just thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning, and I'd especially like to thank our clients for their continued support in our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them.

Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter who is dialing in from London; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell, Head of Investor Relations. The third quarter was eventful for Marsh & McLennan. I am pleased with our overall financial results for the quarter and I will talk about them a bit later. Without a doubt, the major highlight of the third quarter was our agreement to acquire Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group. We are progressing with the regulatory and shareholder approval process.","In the U.S., we recently received antitrust regulatory approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, concluding the competition review of both the FTC and Department of Justice. Also, JLT has announced it will hold a General Meeting of Shareholders on November 7 for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval. As we move forward, the transaction remains subject to additional antitrust and regulatory approvals. At this point, we expect closing sometime in the spring of next year. Our executive committee spent last week in London getting to know the senior leadership of JLT better as well as addressing the broader JLT colleague base through a large town hall meeting. There is tremendous energy and optimism on both sides around the benefits this acquisition will bring to clients, colleagues and shareholders. Following these meetings, I am even more excited about the strategic potential for our combined organization.","The process of planning our future together has begun in earnest. Teams of leaders from both organizations are involved in this effort and decisions will be made from the perspective of bringing the best of both. While JLT is a large transaction for us, we have a strong track record of M&A having executed nearly 160 transactions since the beginning of 2009. Over that time, we have had success in retaining key talent and maintaining the unique qualities of the organizations we acquire. While no integration is seamless, the combined leadership team has the depth of experience and industry knowledge to grasp the challenges ahead and execute successfully. As I have said previously, this is a combination out of strength on both sides. It is about one thing, growth, growth in talent, capabilities, revenues, margins, and earnings.","Dominic Burke and the JLT management team have built a terrific organization that is highly skilled with a strong track record of growth. Together, we'll deliver even more value for clients. It further solidifies our position as the leading global professional services firm providing advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy and people. We will have the broadest and deepest talent in the industry. Marsh McLennan will be the single-best place to work, the employer of choice and the organization where creative and highly-skilled people will optimize their talent. We will have a relentless focus on clients and improving the client experience. The strength of our combined organization and the unmatched capabilities we bring will be the driving force for client and colleague satisfaction.","We will have deeper industry expertise, stronger geographic positioning, and greater capacity for investments in digital, data and analytical capabilities, which will benefit our clients. We will be out in front of their greatest challenges with innovation and thought leadership. In addition to the JLT news, we had an active M&A quarter on other fronts. During the quarter, Mercer announced the acquisitions of Pavilion Financial Group and Summit Strategies Group within the Wealth division. These transactions, which represent approximately $90 million of combined revenues will strengthen Mercer's investment consulting position in the endowment, healthcare and insurance sectors while adding capabilities in alternative investments. Both firms bring high-quality talent as evidenced by their strong scores in the Greenwich Associates Quality Index for investment consulting.","In early October Marsh & McLennan Agency acquired Eustis Insurance & Benefits, a Louisiana based agency with $17 million of revenue. While deleveraging the balance sheet will be a priority over the next couple of years, we have provided for the flexibility to continue to pursue selective acquisitions and MMA will be the primary focus given the significant success of this strategy over the last decade. With MMA, we have built the highest quality middle market brokerage business in the industry and we will continue to support their development. I would also like to highlight some leadership changes in Mercer. Martine Ferland was recently named to the newly created position of Group President reporting to Julio. Martine brings more than 30 years of experience in consulting, leadership strategy and delivering client value, having run businesses in Canada, Europe, Pacific, Asia and the U.S.","Under Martine, we will be further simplifying and combining Mercer's three geographic regions into two, U.S.-Canada and International. This aligns more closely with the regional structures in place across the other businesses of MMC. As part of this change, we also announced that David Anderson will lead the newly established international region and that Louis Gagnon will be the new leader for U.S. Canada. Both David and Louis will report to Martine. Now, let me give some highlights of our performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018. Revenue growth in the quarter was strong. Consolidated revenue was $3.5 billion, up 5% or 7% excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard.","Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 5%. With 5% growth in both RIS and Consulting the first time that both segments have had 5% or better underlying growth since the third quarter of 2011. Marsh had 3% underlying revenue growth driven by strong growth of 5% in U.S.-Canada, a continuation of the momentum we saw in the first half of the year. In Guy Carpenter we saw 11% underlying revenue growth in the quarter, bringing them to 7% underlying growth year-to-date. This reflected strong performance across the business. Mercer's 3% underlying revenue growth was driven by continued strength in investments, health and career. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 11%, which was better than our expectations going into the quarter.","As for our bottom line results, adjusted operating income grew 3% and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% in the quarter, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. NOI growth and margin expansion in RIS were strong, offset by expected softness in Consulting, which was driven by the difficult expense in comparison to 2017 that we mentioned last quarter. For the nine months, our consolidated underlying revenue growth stands at 4% and adjusted EPS increased 10% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. In the aggregate, our results for the first nine months position us well to deliver another solid year. For the full-year, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the third quarter, we delivered 5% underlying revenue growth highlighted by underlying growth of 5% in both RIS and consulting. Overall revenue was up 5% or 7% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard ASC 606. For the first nine months of the year, underlying revenue growth was a solid 4%. Operating income in the quarter was $541 million, while adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $535 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 3%. Overall, our adjusted operating margin declined by 30 basis points, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. GAAP EPS declined to $0.54. Adjusted EPS declined 1% to $0.78. Excluding a $0.07 per share reduction from adopting the new revenue standard adjusted EPS grew 8%.","For the first nine months of 2018, GAAP EPS increased 4%, while our adjusted EPS increased 14% to $3.26. Excluding a $0.10 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS was up 10%. In Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decreased 3% to $283 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income grew 13% and adjusted margin rose 110 basis points. For the nine months, revenue was $6.3 billion, an increase of 11% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standards. Underlying revenue growth was 4%.","Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 15%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income increased 10% and our adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.9%. At March, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion with overall growth of 10% and underlying growth of 3%. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of strong growth, delivering 5% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. International was up 2%. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $5.1 billion, up 8% or 3% on an underlying basis. Marsh incurred restructuring charges of $29 million in the quarter and $87 million through the first nine months of the year. We now expect ultimate charges to be towards the high end of our previous $80 million to $100 million range.","Also, adjusted operating results exclude $46 million gain in the quarter on the sale of our risk management software and services business in Marsh. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $215 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 11%. This is the seventh quarter in a row of 4% or higher underlying revenue growth for Guy Carpenter, and the highest underlying growth since the second quarter of 2009. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $1.2 billion with 7% underlying growth. Year-to-date, Guy Carpenter's performance is strong and they are on track to deliver a terrific year. We anticipate their results will temper in the fourth quarter, given the benefit from the significant reinstatement and back-up activity we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.","In Consulting, third (00:14:11) quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, up 4% both including and excluding the impact of the new revenue standards. Underlying revenue growth was 5%. Adjusted operating income decreased 6% to $293 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income declined 6%, and the adjusted margin declined by 210 basis points. This decline was expected due to a tough expense comparison, primarily driven by variable compensation adjustments at Mercer in the third quarter last year. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first nine months of 2018 was 4% with consolidated revenue of $5 billion. For the first nine months, adjusted operating income was down 2%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income decreased 1%.","Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 3%. Wealth grew 2% on an underlying basis with Investment Management & Related Services up 9%, and Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration down 3%. Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under delegated management of $248 billion at quarter end. Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter and Career grew 5%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.5 billion with 3% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $481 million in the quarter with underlying increase of 11%. This result was solid and reflects strength in most practices offsetting continued softness in bank regulatory work.","For the first nine months of the year, revenue was $1.5 billion with 5% underlying growth. Given the performance of Oliver Wyman in the third quarter, our outlook for revenue growth has improved a bit. We now expect modest growth in Oliver Wyman for the second half of 2018 as opposed to our previous guidance of flat. This would imply a decline in fourth quarter revenue in Oliver Wyman on an underlying basis. As Dan mentioned, we have begun integration planning for JLT and are progressing with the regulatory and shareholder approval process. On balance, the key elements of guidance we provided on our investor call on September 18 have not changed. And I want to reiterate some of the highlights. We expect the deal would be accretive to adjusted EPS in year one, excluding intangible amortization, and will produce a double-digit IRR.","Transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to adjusted GAAP EPS in year one, neutral in year two, and accretive in year three. This is an all-cash transaction that will be funded primarily with debt. The amount of incremental debt will be based on the equity purchase price of $5.6 billion, the amount of JLT debt outstanding and fees and other costs associated with the transaction. We continue to estimate annual after tax intangible amortization of $180 million or $240 million on a pre-tax basis. And from a capital management perspective, we have carefully planned the financing in order to maintain our longstanding capital return commitments and maintain a strong ratings profile. The third quarter also included a couple of noteworthy items related to the JLT acquisition.","In order to protect us from exchange rate volatility between announcement and closing, we entered into a Deal Contingent Foreign Exchange hedging contract. As a result of entering into this contract, we recorded a noncash charge of $100 million reflecting the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument at the end of the quarter. The amount of this item will change as we progress to closing as well as due to exchange rate volatility. Despite the volatility we will see from fair value accounting under GAAP, the full cost of this hedge was contemplated in our estimate of overall transaction cost. We also incurred $3 million of expense from the amortization of fees related to our bridge facilities. This $3 million is included in interest expense in our GAAP income statement.","Lastly, we are pleased that subsequent to our announcement both Moody's and S&P affirmed our current ratings albeit with a change in outlook that was expected. Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis, we had $4 million in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income in the fourth quarter will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $52 million in the quarter and included an $81 million write-down of the value of our investment in Alexander Forbes in order to bring our carrying value in line with the current trading value of their share. This adjustment was partially offset by mark-to-market gains on other equity investments as required by recent accounting changes.","It's important to note that the adjustment to our carrying value of Alexander Forbes was noncash and purely due to their stock's trading value. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we've excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as noteworthy items. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a slight drag in both revenue and overall NOI. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to revenue and NOI for the fourth quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 25.3%, compared with 26.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted tax rate included a net benefit of $4 million from discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%.","Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, compared with 26.1% last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our effective tax rate excluding discrete items will be approximately 26%, consistent with the underlying rate we have seen through the first nine months of the year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $6.2 billion, compared with $5.5 billion at the end of 2017. During the quarter, we amended and extended our committed credit facility for a new five-year period. As part of the renewal, the facility was increased by $300 million to a total of $1.8 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also repaid $250 million of senior notes that were due in October. Our next scheduled debt maturity is $300 million of senior notes due in September 2019. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock for $175 million.","Through nine months, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares for $675 million. As part of our capital planning related to the JLT acquisition, it is unlikely we will repurchase any stock for the remainder of 2018 and into the early part of 2019. In 2019, however, we do anticipate repurchasing enough stock to meet our commitment to reduce our share count each year. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $820 million and included $175 million for share repurchases, $211 million for dividend, and $434 million for acquisition. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2 billion and included $675 million for share repurchases, $594 million for dividend, and $691 million for acquisitions. As you heard in Dan's remarks, 2018 has been another active year for acquisitions. As a result, we expect to deploy $2.6 billion of capital in 2018 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.","And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of addressing questions from as many participants as possible, we would ask that all participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. We will take our first question today from Morgan Stanley, Kai Pan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. So, my first question on JLT, Dan, just follow-up on your comments you have spoken with the clients and employees over the last months. And I just wondered can you give some example to see your comfort levels about a potential revenue opportunity or decent synergy if there's any risk as well as a $250 million cost-saving target? And also if you can confirm \u2013 if you can like discuss if you're going to report cash EPS going forward after the deal close.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. So, let me take the first part of that question, and then I'll take the second part, and hand it over to Mark. So, the \u2013 our entire MMC executive team, leadership team spent last week in London, and we met with many people at JLT, and then we had a town hall which had around 1,500 people, and so it was a great display on both sides of talking about the industry and the business. We didn't get into a lot of specifics in anything. I mean, we're still in a period where there's a shareholder vote, November 7. We're still working through regulatory approval, so it's fairly high-level. And of course, we're not reaching out as Marsh McLennan to any JLT clients. We've obviously been contacted by some of our clients.","And we view on an overall basis. Clients make decisions based upon capabilities not based upon individuals, not based upon what badge the company is carrying. It is the capabilities of the firm. And so that gives me a lot of comfort in thinking that the capabilities of the combined firm will be stronger than how we operate as individual companies. I mean I did get a real sense from the JLT leadership team and the extended leadership team as to what kind of esprit de corps they have and the camaraderie and the chemistry. And so, I'm really looking for JLT to be a jolt of energy within Marsh & McLennan and as I've said on the initial call last month, both organizations are operating in a position of strength right now. We are both stronger than we were three years ago. And bringing us together at this moment in time is really powerful and I think more than anything else, we'll deliver increased value to clients.","Now, I mean obviously we're not going to know until things go on for many more months and even years about the puts and takes of any large acquisition. We're confident that this will work out for both firms and certainly for our clients, our colleagues, and our shareholders. As I said in the first call, Kai, we're a conservative company. So we didn't model this thing in a way that creates a lot of strain in terms of \u2013 will we get this kind of expense synergy and will we get this kind of revenue dyssynergy and what will happen over a longer stretch in time on the revenue side. Time and time again, we went the conservative route. The math still worked and so from that standpoint, I'm quite comfortable that this will turn out to be somewhere between a very good and a spectacular acquisition for Marsh & McLennan.","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Dan, you want me to...?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I did. Sure. Why don't you take the cash EPS question?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Hi, Kai. How are you doing?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good.","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","So, JLT is obviously a large transaction and it's going to have a lot of financial reporting implications, not the least of which as you intimate (00:27:54). There's going to be a lot of noncash intangible amortization coming through our P&L and it's actually common in a lot of large transactions where companies will make a switch to exclude that from their adjusted results. But all of that said we're still working through all. This is a large transaction. We're still working through all of the reporting implications. And we haven't reached any conclusions on that or other implications for how we report and I would expect in our fourth quarter call we'll have a lot more perspective.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very good. Yes. My follow-up is on the margin side. You have a full year guidance on the sort of full year margin expansion. If you look at first nine months, you're probably 30 basis point below last year on old accounting basis, which imply you might have to sort of improve margin about 100 basis point in the fourth quarter to make it up. I just wonder what's your \u2013 what give you comfort that you can see a big margin expansion in the fourth quarter? As well as, can you confirm that the margin expansion year-over-year is on old accounting basis, what about on new accounting basis compared with a year ago?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So certainly, the margin expansion that we're talking about is on the old accounting basis and is comparable to the way that we've always reported to you in the past. And I would like to say, yeah, we're anticipating a pretty good fourth quarter at least on the bottom line side of things And so, I'm comfortable saying that we believe 2018 will be our 11th consecutive year of margin expansion for the overall company, notwithstanding the fact that through nine months we're at 30 bps of contraction. And I would just say to \u2013 on a broader basis, and I've said this many times before, while we do see continued opportunity for operating leverage in both segments, you have to understand that our focus as a leadership team is more on earnings growth than on margin expansion.","We believe that margin expansion is an outcome of running a business properly where revenue growth exceeds expense growth. It's very infrequently that we get upside down and we recognize that the Consulting division has been upside down. We don't expect it to stay upside down. But yes, it's been upside down thus far this year. When we look at this year in general, it's a bit of an odd year, and if another question from somebody else wants us to get back into the details of the things that we talked about last quarter that we would, we'll do that. Now, I answered your question on the old accounting basis. Mark, do you have any comments?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, Kai, when we make the statement about margin expansion for the year, it is on the old basis of accounting. Remember, we didn't restate last year, and so we don't \u2013 we're not really projecting externally that way. Although, you'd expect given that there shouldn't be much year-over-year difference, you'd expect margin lift in either case.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much for all the answers.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We now take our next question from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on Guy Carpenter, pretty strong organic growth, 11% in the quarter, in your opening comments you guys pointed to kind of broad-based growth throughout. If we can just get some more details there and then reinsurance is typically a very high margin business. Was that the driver of the margin improvement within RIS in the quarter? Or was there some margin improvement also coming from Marsh which did see 3% growth? And then, if we can also just get a little bit of an initial view for January 1 renewals next year? I know you're a little tempered for fourth quarter given reinstatements last year, but how is the reinsurance business looking in your minds as we think about 2019.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. So before I hand off to Peter, I would just say that we report margins on a segment basis, so we don't want to go fall into the trap of talking about individual operating businesses and what their margins are. You know a lot about our business more than most and so I'll just leave it at that. But the overall margin on the segment has been pretty good this year and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. But Peter, you want to talk about Guy Carpenter and the growth and how you see things going into January 1.","Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Dan. Elyse, the growth in Q3 was well balanced across all three of our three businesses and our facultative business as well, and we saw particularly strong results from the U.S. and specials \u2013 and our Specialty businesses driven by growth on our health book and good new business growth as well. As I've stated before and I'll state again, we don't make pronouncements on where the market is headed because it will find its own equilibrium. We believe capital is still abundant and demand, well not fundamentally increasing, has increased 2018 over 2017.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Elyse, do you have another question?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, so my second question, in terms of margins. Just a follow-up to Kai's question; do you expect \u2013 you said Consulting should get better over time, would you expect to see some margin improvement there in the fourth quarter? And my second question, since we're modeling on revenue recognition adjusted, it does seem that the impact to EPS on a year-to-date basis was more positive than you would have laid out in your From 8-K earlier this year. Is there going to be a giveback of about that $0.10 in the fourth quarter? Or should we think about there being maybe a positive impact on full-year numbers, just because we're modeling off of that adjusted last year? I just want to make sure we're all setting our expectations correctly.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay, so let me take the margin question and then I'll hand off to Mark to talk about the accounting nature. Your comment about margins, do we expect margins in the Consulting segment to go up in the fourth quarter? Yes, that is our expectation. Do we expect margins in the Consulting segment to be able to go up in the future or will they remain upside down? Looking at Scott and Julio and knowing them and their leadership teams, it's not an expectation, it's knowledge. We will not stay upside down in Consulting. We will improve the business and we will grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses. So Mark, you want to take the accounting question?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. So at least on RevRec, I'll say a few things to this \u2013 it's a dense topic. The first thing I'd say is, this is a major implementation of the standard across the firm and all the assumptions in that implementation with the approaches we had are all performing as designed. And so, any variance that you're seeing from the pro formas to actuals this year is just \u2013 it's a reflection of underlying business performance. And if you think about the impact that standard had is the \u2013 the part of our business that was most significantly impacted was Guy Carpenter and they're up significantly year-over-year. And so, we're happy with the way our implementation is going.","But just remember the directional guidance that those pro formas represent, it's really the standard applied at a high level to our 2017 results and obviously 2018 is turning a little bit better. To your direct point, we are \u2013 so if you had just used that pattern of EPS adjustments across the quarters, we are seeing year-to-date a \u2013 more lift than those pro formas would have suggested. Again, it's primarily as a result of the outperformance in Guy Carpenters. It's real performance. And I would expect to give back a little bit more. So I think the pro formas in Q4 called for $0.05 of giveback in Q4. That's likely to be $0.01 or $0.02 higher. So at this point, there's probably a modest amount of year-over-year lift but we will give back more in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated. And so, that full year-to-date benefit you're seeing, we don't expect that will be the year-to-date benefit for the full year.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","So, Elyse, I'd like to just take a moment because I've made a clear statement that we expect over time our consulting business not to be upside down. And considering I have the two leaders right in front of me, why don't I hand off to Julio to see whether he agrees with that and then we'll go to Scott. So, Julio.","Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks Dan. I appreciate the hand-off on this. We have certainly continued to manage our businesses with a high degree of discipline, looking for opportunities with this investment so that we can invest in other things of higher growth. Some of that is certainly on display when you think about the inorganic and organic investments that we've made over the last quarters. And to remind you of a few of course, our Mercer Marketplace 365, organic; Investment Management business, we built a terrific investment management business, delegated solutions over many years investing organically, absorbing it into the P&L, and continuing to see great results.","Our colleagues has done a terrific job there. Our Mercer Pension, this exchange is really taking off. And of course on the inorganic side, some of them are notable investments, around Thomsons Online, and continuing investment in Workday and CPSG in the digital front, PayScale partnership, and of course, Pavilion, Summit, and most recently our alliance with Morningstar. All of those things, of course, are things that we are investing for \u2013 for short, medium and long-term benefit to continue to be able to drive top-line profitable growth over a long period of time.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you. Scott?","Scott McDonald - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","All I'd add Elyse is that \u2013 like the rest of the MMC businesses, we also have a strong discipline around growing revenues greater than costs over time, and we will continue to do that. We continue to see really strong growth prospects ahead, and that should be possible.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, guys. Elyse, anything else?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, I'm all set. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Perfect. Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We now take our next question from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Within Mercer, between the recent acquisitions you mentioned in the prepared remarks and organic growth trends it looks like Investment Management will eventually be a larger revenue contributor than Defined Benefit Consulting. I'd love to know if those businesses have similar margins but I doubt you want to go down that path. Maybe you can help us size up how you would view the long-term growth rate for Investment Management, maybe how we can better size up the growth which has been phenomenal there?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Thank you for that. First I want to take my hats off to our colleagues in the Investment and our Wealth business who have built a terrific business quite frankly, quarter-after-quarter continuing to outperform and be industry-leading and clients really \u2013 value proposition really resonating with client. So I sort of want to start off there, it's a business where we have been able to build a great brand in this space where we continue to invest organically and continue to invest inorganically as mentioned earlier with Pavilion, Summit, and Morningstar and we'll continue to see great strength there. From time-to-time, just like anything else you have a quarter that that does one thing or the other. But over the long term, this is business that we're pretty bullish on and we're going to continue to invest in and see great prospects for the future.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Now one other thing, just that we won't go down the path, Mike, of your margin question but broadly speaking, and I mentioned it on last quarter's call, the DB business, the Defined Benefit business is a very high margin business, which as we have said before is in a structural long-term decline based upon no new DB information. And that Mercer has done a really a wonderful job building other businesses which will ultimately replace that revenue but at this moment in time as I said last quarter, those businesses don't aggregate to the same level of margin and so you do have this headwind against you as DB is declining and the other businesses are growing, some of those businesses we expect to have similar margins in the future. Not all of those businesses, but some of them. Next question? Mike. Do you have a follow up?","Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. One quick follow up. Maybe you can quickly just touch directionally on the P&C pricing environment, Property & Casualty pricing environment? And also some insurance carriers have been talking about a pickup in claims inflation being a trend. Just curious if any of your data can see that as well? Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Well I'll have both John and Peter comment, John first. So John, the P&C environment?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Price changes in the quarter were pretty consistent with what we observed in the second quarter. Prices were up a little bit more than 1%, about 1.4% overall. Casualty pricing was down almost 2% largely driven by work comp pricing pressure here in the United States. Property was up about 3%, a little bit more than what we observed in the second quarter. Financial lines pricing, primarily D&O-driven, over 3% in the quarter. Roughly the same as what we observed in the second quarter so not a lot changed really in the second quarter.","On a regional basis, Asia and continental Europe, rates overall were down slightly. Other regions were flat to up slightly. Australia is kind of the one outlier, where price increases are north of 10% on average and we've seen that over the course of 2018. Insurers are talking about loss cost inflation on particularly on longer tail lines. It's early to say whether we see that from our data across the board. But we are seeing some evidence of that for sure. But I would add, the industry remains very well-capitalized and with interest rates rising as well, I expect the market to continue to be stable.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Peter, you want to comment on the market from a reinsurance perspective?","Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure, Dan. Thank you. Mike, if I look at it and I bifurcate the rates between loss impacted and non-loss impacted business, on loss impacted business on the property side rates are anywhere between flat and up double-digits. On non-loss impacted property business, they're negative 5% to plus 5%. On Casualty business same thing, loss impacted is anywhere between 2.5% and 5% and non-loss impacted is anywhere from negative 3% to plus 5%. And I think it's fair to say that even with $100 billion of loss last year, reinsurance rates have not moved appreciably in 2018.","Michael Zaremski - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Next question please, operator.","Operator","Thank you. We now like to move to Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Hey. Thanks. I guess my first question just trying to put 2018 in context as a margin year. So, 2016 and 2017 we actually look like \u2013 looks like we had less organic revenue growth. In 2016, it was 140 bps of margin expansion. Last year, that was 70 bps. And this year, it looks like we're running around 4 bps and we're just trying to get to some margin expansion and there's a restructuring going on. So, I'm just trying to understand like is 4% kind of the new bogey in terms of being able to expand margins going forward or is there something special from an investment standpoint that's just made it more challenging this year?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, I would start by saying that we're focused more on earnings growth than anything else. And if I look at earnings growth for the year, NOI year-to-date within RIS is up about 10%. Consulting is having an off year for reasons that we had talked about before. I don't believe 4% is a new bogey and is replacing 3% because our expenses on a continuum are not growing at any faster pace than they were growing over the last couple of years, so we still believe that fundamentally around 3% we should be able to expand margins when we're at that level. This is a bit of an odd year and we signaled it not just last quarter but even the quarter before that.","And if you look at the second quarter of this year, RIS had a really tough comp since the expense growth was zero in the second quarter of 2017, and we always knew that the third quarter was going to be an issue for Consulting since Mercer made an adjustment to its variable comp pool in the third quarter of last year, which resulted in them being down minus 2% in expense growth and obviously that was a really tough expense comparison and that explains virtually all of the drops in the third quarter of 2018 as it relates to the Consulting division. So, in this room we're all looking forward to the fourth quarter and we're all looking forward to 2019.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Got it, understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Mark. The pension credit year-to-date, any \u2013 I think that was flat with last year. Any indication of what that's going to be in 2019 relative to this year?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Ryan, it's too early to tell. Really, whether it comes to cash funding or the expense or credit looking forward, those things really depend on our year-end valuation and that's part of what we're doing now. So, we would typically comment on that in our fourth quarter call early next year.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. But it's fair to say that over the last several years we have materially de-risked pension as a P&L type of issue for the company. The next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We take our next question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I think you've touched on this, but I wanted to dig in a little bit more. Given the overall, I guess, U.S. employment situation, should we expect a higher drift upward in salary and benefits expense excluding major acquisitions in 2019?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I mean, we watch \u2013 obviously, in a consulting brokerage firm, compensation and benefit is the largest cost of operating the business. And so, we watch it. We're a good payer, and we believe that we attract and retain very high quality colleagues. And so, we look at \u2013 across not only our industry but other industries in terms of attracting people in. So, our goal is not necessarily to drive our comp and then (00:48:35) as a percentage of revenue ratios lower. But having said that, we watch them very carefully, and when we look at a rolling 12-months basis over the last couple of years, it's relatively consistent.","It's certainly \u2013 if anything, it's slightly lower than higher. So, we don't feel any inflation pressure on \u2013 with regard to higher levels of employment in the U.S. driving higher costs for us. I think the reality is, Meyer, for the last several years the unemployment rate in the U.S. for skilled positions in the areas in which we operate was zero. And so, from that standpoint, this situation has existed for a long period of time. Now, on the positive front, higher levels of employment creates \u2013 should create higher levels of business confidence, higher levels of payroll, higher levels of exposure units on things like workers' comp and casualty but that \u2013 time will tell on that as we move forward.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. No, that's helpful and yeah, hard to get, worst impact than zero. Mark, you touched on the FX impact overall in the quarter. Was there any observable impact on the individual segment margins from foreign currency?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","No. The impact on margins wasn't terribly significant.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Sure. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. A couple of quick questions here for you. First one, I'm wondering. Is there any way you can quantify what the benefit to kind of the expenses are in the RIS from the restructuring program that's going on or margins, what kind of benefits you're seeing?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I mean at the end, it's mild. As we said, on the call when we talked about the restructuring the first time, we weren't going to quantify the number of bottom line savings. We believe some of the restructuring will drop to the bottom line that would probably be more impactful next year than this year. The other thing would be we are going to be reinvesting some of the savings in areas that we believe we can accelerate in digitization, data and analytics where we've been investing as we go. And in fact, obviously, it's a margin headwind as we build capabilities in those areas. We're not really getting much revenue in those areas now but we are certainly picking up the expense. But ultimately, we believe, revenue will come from that. And as we've done in the past \u2013 we've said in the past, we're sort of a pay-as-you go investment company.","We've had pretty consistent CapEx over a number of years. We don't build up levels of investment, but where we see an opportunity and between digital analytics, AI, ML, RPAs, there's a lot going on in the world and we've got to participate. We've got to take some risks, we've got to innovate, some of that cost money, and we want to free up some money to do that without overly impacting our expense rates. And that's one of the reasons why we're dropping some of the restructuring into reinvestment as opposed to alter the bottom line.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Makes sense, makes sense. And then just quickly, a question on JLT. Of the cost saves these guys anticipate at (52:24) $250 million, does that include or anticipate any type of retention packages you're going to have to have for kind of key producers and executives?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there's a couple of things. One, I never believe you can buy people's loyalty. People work for a company, when they're highly skilled they have choices. They can work in a lot of different firms. We want them to choose the combined company, we want on both sides, Marsh & McLennan people and JLT people. And so we have to create the environment as a combined leadership team that essentially fuses the culture and preserves and celebrates those parts of JLT's culture, which are different from Marsh & McLennan and makes them so unique and special. And I think that's the single most important factor. Now, having said that, within our deal model they are on a go forward basis. We're certainly going to develop some level of appropriate retention mechanism for a select group of very key individuals but it will not be widely applied.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Next question.","Operator","I'll now turn back to Mr. Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Daniel S.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2019 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u2019s website at www.mmc.com.","Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.","For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.","During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of those measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today\u2019s earnings release.","I will now turn the conference over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Holly. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.","2019 was a remarkable year for Marsh & McLennan. We completed the acquisition of JLT. The largest deal in our history, while delivering strong financial results and managing the global integration. MMC is well positioned. Our talent capabilities, expertise and leadership have never been stronger. In addition of world class talented JLT compliments our best in class teams at Marsh & McLennan, and while we still have work to do, we feel good about how the cultures are coming together. ","Nearly all our teams are now sitting together and more and more we are in the market working as one. We finished the year with revenue of $16.7 billion, up 11%. This represents our highest annual topline growth in 20 years and it is a step change for us. On a run rate basis, we now have over $17 billion of annual revenue. We had an excellent year and I\u2019m pleased that in the midst of the integration we generated underlying growth of 4%.","The tenth year in a row where our underlying growth was in the 3% to 5% range. 14% adjusted NOI growth. 110 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7% adjusted EPS growth consistent with our guidance of modest dilution in the first year of the deal. We met our capital management objectives to reduce our share count and increase our dividend by double digits. And we are running ahead of schedule on acquisition related cost savings. We now expect run rate savings of at least 350 million and we will continue to drive for additional operating efficiencies.","Overall, I am pleased with our performance in 2019. We consistently challenge ourselves to balance delivering for today, while positioning for sustained growth in the future even in an exceptional year like 2019. We continue to invest in Marsh & McLennan Agency, our fast-growing U.S. middle market brokers business completing five acquisitions in 2019, resulting in current run rate revenue of 1.7 billion and we have a robust pipeline for 2020.","We made additional investments in digital, technology and analytics. We see further opportunity to leverage technology, to expand in small commercial, as well as streamline and automate our business. We also see increasing opportunity to leverage the collective strength, expertise in relationships across our business to deliver enhanced value to clients and drive growth.","Lastly, 2019 saw the seamless transition of leadership at Mercer with Martine taking over as CEO. Martine was critical to install new leaderships in key areas, energized the workforce and implement changes that streamline the operating model, create more efficiency and enables better execution. As we conclude 2019, we emerge a stronger firm than we started out the year with record revenue record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share.","As we look into the future, there is significant uncertainty in the world given current global issues by geopolitical risk, negative interest rates, trade friction, extreme weather and climate change, pandemic risk, and cyber risk. We come to the four in these dynamic times by providing trusted support to our clients in the areas of risk, strategy, and people.","Marsh & McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues at the World Economic Forum in Davos. This was the 15th consecutive year we produced the annual global risk report together with the World Economic Forum. The report ranked some top global risk and this year climate and weather-related risk created the greatest concern. Climate change was the most prominent issues discussed at Davos, and there is glowing recognition of the urgency at both mitigation and adaptation.","We are engaged with our client across all of our businesses on helping them assess the impact of a change in climate. Mercer and Oliver Wyman had session on general quality, longevity, responsible investment, and AI readiness. Despite all the uncertainty in the world, I am optimistic. Business leader continued to push for growth and investment despite near term risk and fears about the longer-term implications of climate change.","The perspectives and insights we provide on these topics are a reminder of the uniqueness of MMC and the value we bring to our clients. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trends. Pricing is firming across a wide range of geographies and lines. The Marsh Global Insurance Market index saw an increase of nearly 11% in the fourth quarter, compared with 8% in the third quarter, 6% in the second, and 3% in the first.","Global property insurance and financial and professional lines saw the highest average renewal rate increases at 13% and 18% respectively. Casualty rates are up 3% on average, up slightly versus the third quarter. Commercial auto and excess cash we continue to see rates rising while workers comp continues to see rates decline. Note that the Marsh index skews to larger risks, which are seeing higher increases, although middle-market and small commercial insurance rates are up in certain geographies.","Turning to reinsurance, the Guy Carpenter global property catastrophe radar line index rose by 5% at the January 1 renewals. All those dedicated reinsurance capital increased by approximately 2% at year-end. Although renewal outcomes vary widely across individual programs, capacity is tightened in some stress classes like commercial auto, D&O, medical professional, and general liability.","The retrocessional market continues to see meaningful increases in rate at January 1, driven in part by track capital, a lack of new alternative capital entrants and continued redemption from third party investors. The overall global P&C insurance market is challenging and we continue to work hard to deliver the best solutions for our clients. In times like these where our expertise and capabilities shine.","Turning to the fourth quarter, we are pleased with our results. Our overall revenue growth in the quarter was 15%. Underlying revenue grew 3% with growth in both segments. Marsh grew 3% in the quarter on an underlying basis, which is solid, but slower than the prior quarter as expected due to a peak headwind on new business and a tough comparison for the fourth quarter of 2018.","Guy Carpenter finished the year strong with 10% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. Mercer delivered 4% underlying revenue growth in the quarter with strongest growth since the first quarter of 2018, and Oliver Wyman declined by 2% as we expected. The overall fourth quarter saw strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 17%. ","As we consistently say, it is important not to over emphasize a single quarter and rather look at performance over longer periods of time. Looking at the full-year, we are pleased with our results. We generated strong overall revenue growth of 11% for the full-year with 4% underlying growth. We demonstrated topline strength across our businesses, while achieving the initial benefits of the integration.","On an underlying basis, Marsh delivered solid growth of 4% for the second consecutive year. Guy Carpenter had a strong year with 5% growth. Mercer had 2% growth and Oliver Wyman grew 6% for the year, despite the pull back in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted NOI grew 14% with overall margin expansion of 110 basis points for the year, marking the 12th consecutive year we have reported margin expansion. Adjusted EPS grew 7% or 8% on a constant currency basis consistent with our guidance of modest adjusted EPS dilution in the first year of the JLT acquisition.","In sum, 2019 was an example of strong overall execution on multiple levels. As we look at 2020 and beyond, our future is bright. The addition of JLT enhances our competitive position. We are increasingly bringing our collective strength to clients and we expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology. In 2020, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range. Margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark McGivney","Thank Dan. Good morning. We are pleased that our fourth quarter results, which capped a strong year in 2019. Consolidated revenue increased 15% in the quarter to $4.3 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3% and the continued contribution from JLT. Operating income was $592 million, while adjusted operating income rose 17% to $856 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP EPS rose to $0.76 and adjusted EPS increased 90% to $1.19.","Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue grew 24% to 2.4 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis. Good result considering the tough comparison Marsh faced to its strong fourth quarter in 2018 and the fact that Q4 was JLT\u2019s seasonally largest quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 31% to $550 million, and the adjusted margin expanded 200 basis points to 25.7%.","For the year, revenue was $9.6 billion, an increase of 17% and solid underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the year was up an impressive 17% and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 60 basis points to 26.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 23% to $2.2 billion increasing 3% on an underlying basis. The U.S. Canada division underlined growth of 4% for the quarter and 5% for the full-year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of 4% or higher underlying growth for U.S. Canada.","In the quarter, the international division had underlying growth of 1% with Asia Pacific up 7%, Latin America up 2%, and EMEA down 1%. For the full-year, revenue at Marsh was $8 billion, an increase of 17% or 4% on an underlying basis. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was 152 million, an increase of 10% on an underlying basis for the quarter, representing an outstanding finish to a strong year. The growth in the quarter benefited from strong results in North America, as well as growth in retrocessional and an active quarter for GC Security. For the year revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 15% or 5% on an underlying basis.","In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 4% to 1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Consulting adjusted operating income was flat year-over-year at 359 million and the adjusted operating margin of 19.7% declined 60 basis points versus a year ago, but looking to full-year margin expansion is solid. For the year, revenue was 7.1 billion, an increase of 5% with underlying growth of 3%.","Adjusted operating income for the year was up 9% to 1.3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points to 18.6%. Mercer\u2019s revenue increased 8% in the quarter to 1.3 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis with investment management up high single digits and define benefits download single digits.","Our overall access under management continue to grow. At year-end, exceeded 305 billion, up 5% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Health revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong growth in both international and in the U.S., Career grew 4% on an underlying basis with strong growth in serving products and digital implementation.","For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5 billion, an increase of 6% or 2% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter was $559 million, a decline of 2% on an","underlying basis. As we said on our last call, we expected a full backing in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Oliver Wyman produced strong underlying revenue growth of 6%. We made great progress in 2019 on the JLT integration and are on plan or ahead of schedule on key milestones.","We continue to expect the transaction when we modestly diluted to adjusted EPS in the first quarter, mutual in year two, and accretive in year three. We are ahead of schedule on cost savings and restructuring actions. We now estimate run rate savings of at least 350 million. We expect to incur approximately $625 million of cash cost to generate those statements.","In addition, there will be approximately 75 million of non-cash charges, mostly property-related cost as we consolidate our real estate foot print. We achieved approximately 125 million of savings from year-end 2019 and expect to achieve the balance by the end of 2021. We also encouraged 335 million of JLT integration and restructuring cost in 2019 to achieve these savings.","It is our expectation that the bulk of the remaining costs will be incurred in 2020 with a more modest amount extending into 2021. This update reflects the plans we have today, and as we continue to get deeper into the integration there is a possibility for more savings opportunities to emerge. As we look to the first quarter of 2020, keep in mind that the last quarter were our year-over-year comparison is impacted by JLT. Remembering RIS the first quarter is seasonally small for JLT.","In addition, JLT\u2019s employee benefits margins are relatively low in the first quarter and we expect this along with some quarterly volatility will result in decline in first quarter Consulting margin. However, for the full year, as Dan mentioned, we expect strong earnings growth consolidated adjusted operating margin expansion.","Turning back to the fourth quarter, adjusted corporate expense was 53 million in the quarter. Fourth quarter, we recorded 264 million of noteworthy items. The majority of which are related to the JLT acquisition. Included in this total are 143 million of JLT integration cost, largest categories which is severance, 17 million of JLT acquisition-related costs, 56 million of other restricting costs, and 42 million of earnout true-ups relating to prior acquisition.","As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, we will give a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were 122 million in 2019, up slightly from the 112 million in 2018. We expect cash contribution in 2020 will be roughly 160 million. For 2020, we anticipate our other net benefit credit to be slightly lower than in 2019. Based on current expectations we would assume roughly 264 million for this item in 2020.","Investment income was 2 million in the fourth quarter for both GAAP and adjusted results. For the full-year 2019, our GAAP investment income was 22 million and adjusted investment income was approximately 12 million. For 2020, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was a slight headwind for adjusted EPS in the quarter and is up $0.05 per share negative impact for the full year 2029.","[Assuming] exchange rates remain at current levels; we expect FX to be at slight headwind from adjusted EPS for 2020. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.4%, compared with 23.6% in the fourth quarter last year. For the full-year 2019, our adjusted tax rate was 24.1%. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate for the full-year was approximately 26%.","When we give forward guidance and have our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for 185 million. For the full year 2019, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for 485 million.","Total debt at the end of 2019 was 12 billion, compared to 12.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Net debt maturities in March 2020, 500 million of senior notes will mature. During the fourth quarter, we incurred 130 million or interest expense, we expect approximately the same amount in the first quarter of 2020.","As we look to 2020, the frame work for capital management we discussed in the early stages of JLT is still on track. This year, we currently expect to deploy approximately 2.6 billion to 2.9 billion of capital across three broad categories. Debt reduction, dividends in line with our objective of double digit increases annually, and a combination of acquisitions in share repurchases.","Directionally, we currently expect the amount of capital deployed to be roughly equivalent across these three categories. This plan allows us to maintain our dividend growth objective and meet the commitments for deleveraging we laid out when we announced JLT. We also provide flexibility for M&A. We\u2019ve consistently stated that we favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term.","Our track record is good, as evident by our return on invested capital of nearly 20% over the last three years. Given our deleveraging plan and our acquisition pipeline, we currently do not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020. Ultimately, share repurchases later in the year would depend on how the M&A pipeline developed. Our deleveraging should be largely complete by the end of this year and we expect to have substantial flexibility in terms of capital deployment in 2021 and beyond.","Our cash position at the end of the four quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled $444 million and included $24 million for acquisitions, $235 million for dividends and $185 million for share repurchases. For the full year 2019, uses of cash totaled $7.5 billion, and included $6.1 billion for acquisitions, $890 million for dividends and $485 million for share repurchases.","In summary, we are proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in 2019. We\u2019re very much on track with the objectives we set when we announced the JLT acquisition. And if you look forward to 2020, our outlook is for another year of strong performance.","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Mark. Operator we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, my first question, you guys updated the savings program for JLT toady. It also seems like intangibles are coming in a good amount lower than when you guys had announced this deal. So, I\u2019m just trying to, I guess get from that that you have these two tailwinds to your numbers and you still are, you know, reaffirming I guess that the deal will be breakeven in 2020 and accretive in 2021. So, what's the offset relative to your initial expectations that this deal, might not be accretive sooner than you had expected?","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Well, you know, actually it\u2019s going to be at least accretive consistent with our original expectations. And so, a deal of this size has always a number of puts and takes. And as you mentioned, we think the cost savings are higher, we think the amortization in lower, and then we also needed to divest some businesses, principally aerospace, but also some minority interest in other businesses like CRP here in the U.S., which we did not anticipate, you know, going into the transaction. And we also have some revenue headwinds that we had described before whether that was from new business pipeline issues or some staff inspections. Those are things that we're grappling with.","So, you put it all together and the deal is tracking in line with our original expectations, and our original expectations, I\u2019ll just remind everybody, were really good. That was going to be a good solid financial transaction. It was also very strategic in nature for Marsh & McLennan as a company. And when we talk about things like accretion and dilution, you know, it\u2019s always a level of how we\u2019re growing, you know, so it\u2019s \u2013 we expect 2020 to be a strong year in adjusted EPS growth, you know, and that\u2019s what breakeven means to us.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question, on last quarter\u2019s call, you guys had alluded to the overall margin for the company expanding more than the year-to-date level. It seems like the fourth quarter came in a little bit below your expectations. Was that just may be, you know, a little bit weaker consulting margin? Just trying to understand what happened in the fourth quarter as we kind of think about the level of margin improvement going forward.","Dan Glaser","We focused very much on earnings growth and topline growth much more than we do on margin and we certainly don't really pay much attention to any one single quarter. We were satisfied for the year with the 110 bips and the fourth quarter was pretty consistent for the year. There\u2019s always a lot going in all of our businesses, and so, you know, it\u2019s not that we look at one versus the other as in any way coming up short of what our expectations were.","I mean when I look at margins in general for the company, 2019 is going to be our 12th consecutive year of margin expansion and nearly significant levels of margin expansion. When you go back a decade and we\u2019re up by 1300 bips, you go back five years, we\u2019re up, you know, 450 bips plus in both segments and as a company, and so, you know, but just to go back, I wouldn\u2019t look at any one quarter as being indicative, you need to look at longer periods of time.","And margin expansion for us is an outcome of how we run the business, which is revenue growth almost always exceed expense growth and that will give us margin expansion over time. And the only areas that we were really driving for some margin this year was in RIS in parts of the portfolio, particularly, in Guy Carpenter that we felt we needed to adjust JLT to more similar margin levels in what we had normally been operating within as Marsh & McLennan. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Mike Zaremski","Good morning. First question regarding the Risk and Insurance segment, looking at the EMEA segment, you know, growth there has been, let\u2019s call it, a very, very low-single digits for the past couple years. Is that a pace that we should kind of \u2013 you know any color, is [that a patient], maybe, we should expect thinking about it into this year? and then, I guess also LatAm growth also just of a little bit weaker in the second half of the year, anything going on there and just sort of thinking out till 2020?","Dan Glaser","Yes, I\u2019ll take you to a little bit and then I'll hand over to John. You know overall, believe we\u2019re set up well in both EMEA and Latin America for the future growth not even in \u2013 not only in 2020, but beyond. Honestly, EMEA includes UK, which has been our biggest area of overlap with JLT where we knew it was going to be a bit choppy for a while. And so, that\u2019s essentially when we look at the business, we unpack the different component parts of EMEA. But, John, do you want to add more to that?","John Doyle","Sure, Dan, thanks. Big picture, 23% GAAP growth in the quarter, you know, very, very big growth. 17% for the full year, 4% underlying growth for the full year, so I was pleased with the results. As Dan noted, and as we expected, in the UK the underlying growth was impacted by integration related headwinds and some first quarter challenges remain, but, you know, I will say, I\u2019m encouraged by improvements in the underlying performance in the UK. ","We made some leadership changes now about 18 months ago in the UK, and they're really setting the foundation for stronger growth going forward. And in Latin America, as I noted in the last call, as Dan, integration related challenges will persist through the first quarter, but Latin America remains a high growth region for us. So, for the second quarter on, I expect improved results there. And again, I want to say, I\u2019m pleased overall with the growth. I\u2019m quite proud of the team.","We managed through a lot of change throughout all of 2019 and we maintained our focus on serving our clients in what's an increasingly challenging market as well. And you know as Dan noted, we\u2019re a stronger team entering 2020 and JLT is obviously a big part of that, but, you know, we also had more in late 2018 and did a lot of work on integration of more than last year. And we added two Top 100 firms in the United States through the M&A as well. So, I\u2019m quite excited about the team and how we\u2019re positioned as we enter 2020.","Dan Glaser","You have another one, Mike.","Mike Zaremski","That\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s helpful. Yes. Lastly sticking on the brokerage space, you know, Dan, in your prepared remarks you \u2013 I think you said it was a challenging marketplace. I assume you\u2019re referring to what\u2019s, you know, maybe \u2018a hard market\u2019 and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Just curious does the \u2013 does this challenging market also put a little bit pressure on Marsh\u2019s expense space given, you know, your employees are working, you know, potentially even harder to represent their clients in this marketplace?","Dan Glaser","But we are built to operate well across cycles. And, you know, I mean, the \u2013 I wouldn't necessarily classify the entire market as a hard market, its certainly hard in pockets and its certainly true as you noted that Marsh and Guy Carpenter brokers have to run a lot harder to get things done and had to work, you know really hard and creatively in order to serve clients in challenging market conditions. And so, we recognize that. ","We don\u2019t believe that that puts any over pressure on our expense levels, you know, more than the fact that we recognized that our people are working harder than ever before and we appreciate that and we reward them for it, you know, but our teams, you know, are driven by serving client, and so, that\u2019s what their focus is. You know, so they're out there hustling, not in the belief that somehow their compensation or anything else is going to change. It\u2019s actually that they\u2019re focused on delivering for their clients.","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Dan, I guess I was hoping maybe you might be able to quantify perhaps the total drags that you think right now the organic revenue growth rate is failing because of, I want to say, disruption, but because of the JLT integration process. And is that \u2013 you know was that worse this quarter than in the third quarter? Is it still getting worse? Or, you know, is the magnitude of that lessening going forward?","Dan Glaser","Well, let me talk about that broadly because I think it\u2019s a good question. First of all, I\u2019d start with the basis, when I look at our underlying growth, I\u2019m pleased with 3% in the quarter, and I'm nearly pleased with 4% for the year, relative to the quarter and Carpenter had a terrific quarter and a strong year, top and bottom line. Oliver Wyman, as expected, they had a tough quarter with 6% for the year. Mercer, 4%, solid for the fourth quarter and sequentially improving throughout the year. And again Marsh, I'm pleased with the 3% given, as we told you, there were some tough comps both from Marsh\u2019s performance last year in the fourth quarter, but also JLT\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter. And then, the new business hurdle, which was a very big new business quarter for JLT last year. ","We had talked to about the pipeline issues throughout the year. And so, you know, in the context of the largest acquisition in our history, I\u2019m quite happy with the underlying growth levels. Although I \u2013 I just like to take another minute to talk about growth a little bit more because I understand the way you're looking at, it\u2019s not the way I look at it. You know from my perspective; we have had a tremendous growth year on multiple levels and we have significantly outgrown our competitors. We've outgrown our competitors and capabilities. In talent, our headcount is up 10,000 people from this time last year. We\u2019ve outgrown our competitors in revenue and the number of clients and it all starts with GAAP.","You know there is certain time where GAAP is more important than underlying and I think this year was one of those times and our total revenue is up 11% in 2019 and 15% in the fourth quarter. If you look at RIS, RIS grew 24% in the fourth quarter. We've been at it for [148 years], and to grow 24% in the quarter and a firm like ours is something, and as John was alluding to before, we grew specifically in Marsh. Latin America was up 15% in the year, Asia-Pacific 39%, EMEA 16% all in 2019 to allow our base and our trajectory will be better for years and years to come as a result of the remarkable year we had in 2019 on a growth basis. Do you have something else, Ryan?","Ryan Tunis","Yes. just \u2013 I guess just on U.S. Canada organic, a little bit of deceleration there. And I'm just curious for your perspective into 2020. I\u2019m thinking about the market conditions like those have seem to be a tailwind. You know, how are you thinking about how all that comes together?","Dan Glaser","Yes. I mean U.S. Canada performance has been terrific the last couple of years, but, John, do you want to talk about that a little more?","John Doyle","Yes, I\u2019m quite pleased with our team, Ryan, in the U.S. and Canada because we had a terrific year this year. I would also remind you that we had 7% organic growth last year in, you know, the underlying growth in the fourth quarter. Both MMA and Marsh had terrific years. We also had a very good finish to the year in Canada and quite a strong year there as well. Our MGA operations in the U.S. are performing quite well as well. Our private client business did quite well from a growth perspective. And on the specialty front, we had good growth in our credit specialty in the private business, aviation did well and the transaction risk in cyber, are a couple of products that are going nicely as well.","Dan Glaser ","Thank you. Next question please. ","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mike Phillips ","Yes, thank you. Good morning everybody. I was just curious, Dan, on your thoughts on how much, I guess at a very high level, how much do think there\u2019s more room to go on the legs of the PNC overall price environment? I mean is that going to peak? Do you say I guess maybe a peak time for maybe the end of this year? Or how much more room do you think there is to grow on the overall environment for pricing?","Dan Glaser","That\u2019s a $64 question. I mean at the end you\u2019ve got different things that work, I think you\u2019ve got many insurance companies who are just satisfied with the results they have achieved financially over the last several years. And so, there was a factor impact in many companies at the same time then they\u2019ve got a little blood in the eye and they're looking to get back to a better position. You also have the, you know thoughts around social inflation and how real that is and how it's impacting their prior book as it will slower.","You have pressures on the reinsurance side, then I\u2019ll go to John and Peter in a minute to give a little bit more, but, you know, there\u2019s pressure on the reinsurance side, which may build throughout the year. This will put some pressure on primary carriers. And so, you know, ultimately, it\u2019s a matter of what\u2019s the loss activity and the premium levels will over time reflect, you know, it\u2019s a benign environment or whether it's a harsh one.","I mean certainly when I think about this year, I look at the level of catastrophe potential, and you know, if it\u2019s a tough cat year, earlier, we\u2019re into a quite a ride. If it\u2019s a benign year, in the Southeast, particularly, well, maybe some of the window is out of the cell, but I don\u2019t think a lot has to do with how casualty develops, but why don\u2019t we start with the primary in John and then we\u2019ll go to reinsurance just to talk more broadly about market conditions and maybe if we have any prognosis, but John?","John Doyle","For me, it is an earnings driven market change for sure. Dan talked about some of the trends continuing into the first quarter, but there continues to be a very wide range of outcomes in markets built around the world. I don\u2019t consider it a hard market although it certainly becomes more challenging for our clients. You know, and geography base is Australia, U.S., UK wholesale are seeing the largest increases. In the U.S., it\u2019s about 10% and going for the high teens average rate increase in Australia. In Asia, Continental Europe, Middle East, Latin America, UK retail more mid-single digit price increases.","You look at it from product perspective, Dan, their property is up 13% globally. Financial line is up 17%, meaningful increases there. Causality up 3% where we see a real mix, you know, where comp continues to be down. Excess liability, though, particularly in certain classes of business are quite stressed at the moment. And public P&L, particularly in the United States and Australia, are a couple classes that are the most challenging. You know, I would note, Dan is going to talk about this again, but our index skews the large accounts.","The middle market is flat to low single-digit in many markets, most markets throughout the world, but, you know, we're continuing to hear from underwriters. They're concerned about rising loss cost, as Dan noted social inflation or the impact of litigation funding on the claim environment. You know, we\u2019re also observing and working with our clients through some challenging verdicts in large settlements in pharma and chemicals and commercial auto and in P&L. So, you know, there\u2019s no question. There\u2019s some stress, you know, in the loss environment and its difficult to predict where \u2013 you know, where markets will head, but the there are some storms on the underwriting.","Dan Glaser","Peter?","Peter Hearn","Thank you. I think from a reinsurance standpoint, the market is responding \u2013 very responsible, and it's really been a function at 1-1. The pricing and the renewals were largely shaped by, you know, a couple of factors, deterioration loss experience, a lack of new alternative capital and increasing challenges in the environment with regard to primary insurance and retrocessional markets. You know, there\u2019s a wide spend of pricing, some was flat to down in certain geographies, in others it was down significantly.","In the retrocessional market, we saw increases of between 15% and 20%, but I don't believe the market \u2013 the reinsurance business is hard. I think it\u2019s more expensive, but it certainly isn\u2019t a hard market, which we define as at any price, you can't generate traction.","Mike Phillips ","Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Mike, do you have follow-up?","Mike Phillips ","No. thank you all for your thoughts. I appreciate the color.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields ","Great, thanks. Dan you've been very upfront about the fact that when you worked on the merger, you anticipated some level of producer and client outflow and I\u2019m wondering if you look forward to 2020 is there any margin pressure because in 2019, overly simplistically, you had revenues associated with people that had left the firm?","Dan Glaser","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, but, you know, our anticipation \u2013 I mean as I mentioned it before, there\u2019s always a lot puts and takes in a transaction of this size and geographic breadth, and as we look to 2020, we expect to expand margins as Marsh & McLennan. You know, and so, we think that it will be our 13th consecutive year of margin expansion and we think we\u2019re on the strong year in adjusted EPS. You know, I would say, look, when we went into the transaction, you know, big people business combination, we expected some level of defections. And so, when I \u2013 when we sit here today and we look to where we are, even though there are some people who left the firm who we would have preferred not leave the firm, we\u2019re in good shape.","You know, where we\u2019ve had the most significant levels of levers would be, you know, let\u2019s say in London, in the UK market in London, well, we are strong in London. We were strong and we are stronger today and more people by a very, very wide majority stayed rather than left. And so, we're in great shape from that perspective. And so, I mentioned 10,000 additional headcount, you know, and these are smart, hard-working talented people, which will deliver a lot of value for us into the future, and our ability in a place like London to regenerate ourselves using our existing capability, the JLT addition, and then going into the market to the place and people who have left, our ability of regenerating half of the [talents in] London is amongst the highest places in the world. And so, they \u2013 you know, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s anything more than short-term.","John Doyle","And I would also note that the voluntary turnover rate at legacy Marsh was the best it's been. Since we collected data. So, from that perspective, you know, it\u2019s quite stable year from talent perspective.","Dan Glaser ","Meyer, do you have a follow-up?","Meyer Shields ","Yes, just a quick one. So, in the break down by segment, there was an 8%, I guess hit to Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenues from a divesture. Is that going to persist for the next few quarters?","Dan Glaser","Mark, why don\u2019t you take that?","Mark McGivney","Meyer, on that schedule, you'll see that column heading, it's acquisitions and positions and others. So, from time-to-time, we\u2019ll have to do changes in mapping the businesses or other things that we use that column to adjust for expenditure, the year-over-year comparison are, you know, apples-to-apples. There was no divestiture in Guy Carpenter. It really was just comparability adjustments and the fact that Guy Carpenter is revenue base was so small in the quarter, it just magnified that. There should be no ongoing impact from them.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So, just a question first on Oliver Wyman and the weakness there, I think, organic growth slowed the last couple of quarters, how much of that is just normal volatility in the business versus maybe shifts in spending on the part of your clients?","Dan Glaser","Yes. So, a couple of things. I've mentioned in the past that Oliver Wyman has more volatility on the topline than our other business because they have less recurring revenue, but the \u2013 they actually had a strong year through nine months and they had anticipated some slowdown in the fourth quarter, but Scott do you want to give more detail?","Scott McDonald","Sure. We definitely had a weak Q4, but there was really nothing significant that happened and the result was driven by three things. The first was the project movement from quarter-to-quarter, which regularly happens with us and drive some volatility. We could see that coming in Q4 and we signaled a little bit of a pull back on our last call. The second thing was we did have a solid Q4 last year where we grew 7% and the third thing was, we did see a modest, but what feels very much like a temporary slowdown in a couple of markets in Q4.","So broadly, the business was strong across sectors, but both Europe and Asia showed some weakness, primarily in the financial services business, but it feels like it was temporary, and that the Q4 results they haven\u2019t changed on medium term expectations. We continue to plan for mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth over time. And for the time being, as said, we demand for consulting purposes feels solid across sectors and across regions.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thanks, and [indiscernible] on Guy Carpenter and the second \u2013 each of the past couple of quarters, you\u2019ve had double digit growth and those are obviously the lowest quarters of the year in terms of the base. How much of this is driven just by this base versus maybe better momentum in the business that could potentially carry into this year?","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Peter, do you want to\u2026","Peter Hearn","Jim, it is really a combination of both. They are smaller quarters for us, but they are also being driven by good new growth. We\u2019ve had our third year of record new business wins in the United States in our retrocession business and our Asia-Pacific business. Our facultative business, which we very rarely talk about, has grown significantly. All of those can impact a small quarter as you\u2019ve seen in Q\u2019s 3 and 4, but it\u2019s more a function of phasing than it is anything else and a very disciplined approach to sales and growth.","Dan Glaser","We were very pleased with the progress and growth for the year. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning. My first question is on the cost initiatives from the integration programs, do you have any sense how much of that 350 million or greater will actually fall to the bottom line versus reinvested back in the platform?","Dan Glaser","I mean, general sense is that the majority of it will fall right through the bottom line and that is how we projected when we originally put things together. Obviously, earnings will go well. So, some of them will go into bonus pools and that sort of thing, but a lot of the efficiency gains that we have developed is because of the investments that Marsh & McLennan made over a number of years. You know, when you think about things like financial systems where Oracle 12, everywhere in the world. HR systems, we\u2019re Workday everywhere in the world.","We use sales force extensively throughout the world and so we are able to take an organization by JLT and integrate our systems and controls and functions reasonably seamlessly without adding to a lot of our existing cost base in order to do that, and that gives us a lot of benefit and really I should not impact the frontline client facing people all that much. So \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons why most of it will drop.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, understood. And then going back to some of the questions around growth, from this 3% to 5% organic growth target there could be talked about in the past. Just looking one of your peers have been kind of talking about \u2013 kind of mid-single digit or better or with long-term and I\u2019m just trying to square the 3 to 5 to that other guidance, are there structural differences between the two organizations or is it just more conservative guidance on your part? Are there just near-term headwinds just with the integration now that maybe once you got through those you do that to a higher \u2013 a step-up in that organic growth number?","Dan Glaser","I mean, I\u2019m one of those people who are like, you are with your results, say you are from the last 10 years we\u2019ve been in the 3% to 5% organic growth range. I do not believe that we had many competitors. We\u2019re a pretty unique company across the breadth of the things we do. Clearly, we have certainly formidable competitors and parts of our business, but across all of the things that we do including Oliver Wyman and some of the strong businesses we have within Mercer.","We don\u2019t have many direct competitors, but when I look at the competitive landscape, I absolutely believe I wouldn\u2019t change our strategic positioning with anybody, I wouldn\u2019t exchange our capabilities with anybody or our culture and there is no reason under the sun to where our revenue growth performance would not be as good or better than any of our competitors over time. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Thank you. Not much left to ask, but I guess this is for Mark. Just wondering if maybe the trajectory of expense saves has accelerated a bit from earlier from when you initially gave your guidance on that? I mean, it looked like you, you know what you saved in 2019 as a percentage of what you now think of the total is a little bit higher than how you initially walked into this period and so I am just wondering if that is correct?","Mark McGivney","I guess Larry just that a little bit further on savings, as I said, we expect to take most of the actions to generate the full 350 by the end of this year, just what I said with the charges, maybe a little bit is going to 2021. Then the remainder of the savings have come in over the two years. Probably more in 2020 than 2021, but as I said earlier, we expect to realize the full impact of the savings by the end of 2021.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks. That\u2019s it.","Mark McGivney","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Styblo of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Styblo","Hi there. Thanks for the questions. Just want to ask a little bit about capital deployment after 2020, I think you guys are pretty much done with your debt paydown plans, curious how that effects your thinking for M&A after this year? Does that open up on that, possibly doing something a little bit larger or are you guys inclined just to keep things on a more modest basis as you continue to integrate JLT?","Dan Glaser","We have acquisitions that are a core part of our long-term strategy. We\u2019ve done something like 175 plus acquisitions since January 1, 2009 and we tend to be a balance company. When we look about \u2013 we put out our dividend first. It's sacrosanct. We want to grow it double digit every year and that is going to be for the sake of argument looking at the number of circle $1 billion for that, which should leave in most years 2021 and beyond, roughly a couple of billion dollars to deploy between acquisitions and share repurchase.","And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we favor acquisition over share repurchase for the very reason we\u2019re building a great company and our focus as we have showed over time we\u2019ve been able to do that, you look at Marsh & McLennan Agency in 2009 with zero revenue and no position and now we\u2019ve got a terrific platform, $1.7 billion growing well, good EBITDA margin etcetera. We\u2019re in a business that we otherwise would not have been. That was called building a company and we are committed to continuing to do that with all kinds of opportunities across the enterprise not just in Marsh, but across the firm in order to acquire our way to be a better strong more formidable company in the future.","And so, when you look at that 2 billion and our debt to EBITDA at that level will probably be in the [low 2\u2019s] and so we would have the ability to flex as we needed to. So, there is certainly nothing that we\u2019re finding for in terms of a larger or mega acquisition we will see how this strategy develops over time. It\u2019s certainly having, you know $3 billion to deploy year after year after year is going to make us you know one of the great companies of the world.","David Styblo","Alright, got it. And just a quick house-keeping, I think I heard for the first quarter given the business mix and so forth, the consulting margins were expected to be down year-over-year, I don\u2019t know if I heard a comment about RIS?","Dan Glaser","Yes. We did make a comment specifically about RIS. We wanted to point out consulting because of our visibility to it and we recognize that consulting has its own attributes. You know RIS is a different kind of business and so as you know the consulting margins declined in the fourth quarter, even though we had a 90 bips improvement for consulting for the year and so we just wanted to give a heads-up that our expectation is for a decline in the first quarter for a variety of different reasons which our view is temporary and when we look at the full-year 2020, we expect it to be our 13th year of consolidated margin expansion for the entire firm.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Hi, thanks. Two quick ones here. First, just curious on the EMEA organic revenue growth, the slow down we had in the fourth quarter, I know explained it, should we expect that it kind of continued into the first half of 2020 is from this leadership changes go on?","Dan Glaser","John, you want to take that?","John Doyle","Yes, I think, Brian there is still some headwinds in the first quarter for sure, but as I noted earlier I think that underlying performance works the way through or cut through some of the integration level with headwinds, I think we will see improved performance drop for the rest of the year. By the way, in the middle east, terrific growth year on last year, good solid results in continental Europe as well.","So, obviously it was somewhat hopeful that the U.K. economy will continue to pick up now there is more certainty around Brexit, so a number of different factors that will ultimately determine where we are and I\u2019m quite encouraged by our team leading through all this change.","Dan Glaser","And also, just to bear in mind, the new leader in UK, he was a Marsh veteran. You know, he has worked for the firm for more than 30 years and ran Canada for us, had another big job, so it is not like somebody coming in and having to learn the roles. He knows the business very well and that \u2013 as we mentioned in previous calls, when we think about the short and mid-term, we are optimistic about Britain. ","Britain has sort of been through the radar over the last couple of years, but there is now clarity around Brexit and we have got new leadership in the UK where we are in many different businesses from large account and third to small commercial and we believe it is going to be a great business for us over a stretch of time.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then my second question, just hopefully just a quick one here. Could the coronavirus have any impact in your growth in the fourth quarter in your Asia Pacific business you think at all?","Dan Glaser","Yes. I mean we\u2019re monitoring the situation closely like I\u2019m sure everybody is and our primary concern is definitely the health of our colleagues and their families and we are doing everything we can to assist clients as they think through possible scenarios that can impact their business, but it\u2019s just too early to see that as to whether there is going to be any impact on our business, Asia or otherwise. You know, we just have to see how this plays out in the coming weeks.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.","Dan Glaser","I like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and certainly thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication, as well as our clients for their support. Hope everybody has a good day. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That will now conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. Fourth quarter 2011 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on Marsh & McLennan Companies' website at www.mmc.com.","Before we begin, I would like remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies","Brian Duperreault","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Vanessa Wittman, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our Operating Company CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarksi of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Mike Bischoff. ","My remarks will focus primarily on our full year results and Dan will provide more detail on the fourth quarter. Vanessa will then update you on our financial position. Before we begin the discussion of our results, I'd like to welcome Julio to our company. Julio joined us as President and CEO of Mercer 2 weeks ago. He comes to us from AIG, where he held a broad range of senior positions over 19 years. Most recently, he was President and CEO of Chartis Growth Economies. Julio has had a very successful track record of running large global businesses. His strong leadership characteristics and international experience will serve him well as Mercer\u2019s CEO. ","Now let's move to our financial results. I'm very pleased that we continue to deliver revenue and earnings growth across the enterprise. Marsh & McLennan's performance this year was outstanding. In 2011, we generated revenue growth of 9% with 5% growth on an underlying basis. Importantly, we continue to achieve this revenue growth while maintaining control over expenses with adjusted underlying expenses increasing 4%. As a result, we produced 12% growth in adjusted operating income for the year. In fact, this is the second consecutive year that both of our operating segments achieved double-digit growth in operating income. ","You've heard me talk many times since our September 2010 Investor Day about our plans to produce double-digit organic growth in adjusted operating income. Over the past 2 years, we have delivered against that goal, averaging 11% growth. Within Risk and Insurance Services, revenue increased 9%. Importantly, underlying revenue growth of 5% represents a significant increase from the 2% underlying growth in the prior year, and we generated 12% growth in adjusted operating income and margin improvement. ","Marsh produced underlying revenue growth of 4% with all major geographies contributing. This was driven by higher client retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also produced impressive results in 2011. Underlying revenue growth was 5% driven by both ongoing revenue with new business development and higher retention rates. This was a milestone year for Carpenter as well as revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time. ","The Consulting segment also delivered an impressive performance. Revenue grew 9% with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income rose 12% and the segment margin improved as well. Mercer produced underlying revenue growth of 4% and Oliver Wyman's growth was 7% for the second straight year. ","So in summary, throughout Marsh & McLennan last year, we saw revenue increases and higher levels of profitability. We are very pleased with this performance, which confirms the investment case we articulated at Investor Day in September 2010. We generated organic growth and adjusted operating income of 12%. Growth in adjusted EPS was 13%, excluding the early debt retirement and these are the earnings from which we plan to grow this coming year. Our dividend yield averaged 3%. We maintained low capital requirements. We generated high levels of cash and we made progress on lowering the company's risk profile. As we move forward, we remain committed to focusing on profitable growth and prudent deployment of our excess cash flow in order to produce outstanding long-term returns for our shareholders. ","With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our fourth quarter results in more detail.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Marsh & McLennan continued its excellent performance. We generated solid growth in both underlying revenue and adjusted operating income. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we achieved underlying revenue growth at each of our operating companies. Revenue rose 4% to $2.9 billion in the quarter while underlying revenue growth was 3%. ","Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 6% to $1.6 billion with underlying revenue growth of 4% and with ongoing effective expense management, which is now embedded within the culture of the Risk and Insurance Services segment, adjusted operating income increased 11% to $288 million. The segment achieved a 90 basis point increase in margin while continuing its pace of investment in global analytics, client technologies and strategic recruitment and absorbing additional severance costs. The positive momentum continued at Marsh as it produced another strong quarter. Revenue increased 6% to $1.4 billion in the quarter. Underlying revenue rose 4%. Marsh's growth was across all geographies, led by increases of 9% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Latin America, reflecting high retention rates and new business development. In fact, for the year, new business production exceeded $1 billion. ","In the U.S.\/Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2% in the quarter. Last month, we significantly expanded Marsh's operations in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia with the acquisition of the insurance broking business of Alexander Forbes. The completion of the acquisition of Alexander Forbes operations in 5 other African countries is on track, and Marsh continued to build its agency platform with the acquisition of Seitlin Insurance, one of the largest insurance broking firms in South Florida with revenue of $24 million.  Marsh & McLennan Agency now has annual guidance revenue of $330 million. ","Now turning to reinsurance broking, Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue was $193 million, an increase of 5% from both the reported and underlying basis. This growth was led by its international operations, reflecting the successful execution of Carpenter's long-term business strategy. ","Carpenter has now produced underlying revenue growth every quarter over the past 3 years. This growth was accomplished through ongoing strong new business development and high client retention levels. ","Turning to our Consulting segment, we continued to generate revenue growth. More importantly, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to double-digit growth in earnings and higher margins for the year.  At Mercer, fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $940 million and underlying revenue growth was 2% with all geographic regions contributing to this growth. Over the past 10 months, I have had an opportunity to explore Mercer\u2019s businesses and analyze its strengths, opportunities and challenges. Overall, I am very positive about Mercer\u2019s future. My key observations are that Mercer is a global leader in retirement, health and benefits, as well as talent, rewards and communications and Mercer has important capabilities in outsourcing and investments.","Mercer has a committed and talented colleague base and deep client relationships and Mercer is well-positioned to continue to expand both organically and through selective acquisitions. Julio, Mercer\u2019s new CEO, brings a wealth of experience to his new role. At Chartis, he had responsibility for operations in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Central Europe. Previous key leadership roles he held included President of the Worldwide Accident and Health Division at AIU. I'm confident that Julio, with the help of the Mercer leadership team, will drive profitable growth. ","Looking at Mercer\u2019s financial performance for the year, I am generally pleased with the results. Underlying revenue grew 4%, retirement declined 1% and outsourcing was flat. Health and benefits, talent rewards and communications and Investments all showed very strong revenue growth. ","Turning to Oliver Wyman. On the third quarter earnings call, we indicated that it would be difficult for Oliver Wyman to achieve growth in the fourth quarter due to the economic uncertainty in Europe. ","I am pleased to report that Oliver Wyman's results in the quarter came in slightly stronger than we expected with revenue of $406 million, an increase of 2% on both the reported and underlying basis, representing Oliver Wyman's eighth consecutive quarter of underlying growth. For the year, Oliver Wyman's overall results were also strong, including underlying revenue growth of 7%. ","In conclusion, we are very pleased with the 12% growth in adjusted earnings per share the company produced in the fourth quarter. This capped off a very successful year for Marsh & McLennan both financially and operationally. We remain confident regarding our ability to produce double-digit growth in operating income. With that, let me turn it over to Vanessa.","Vanessa A. Wittman","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As you have heard, the strong financial performance of Marsh & McLennan continued in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, net income was $256 million or $0.46 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.46, representing growth of 12% from the prior year. We are proud of the tremendous progress made over the past year to greatly reduce items that are excluded from adjusted operating income. As a result, our GAAP and adjusted earnings for the year are similar. In 2011, on an expense base of $9.9 billion and operating income of $1.6 billion, the net adjustments to GAAP totaled only $23 million.  For the year, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.77. This includes $72 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of debt last July. Excluding this item, the growth in adjusted EPS was 13%. ","Now let me add some color regarding other items. In the fourth quarter, we took advantage of favorable credit market conditions by arranging a new $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility that replaced the 3-year credit facility that was due to expire later in 2012. This new facility increases our financial flexibility with an extended duration and reduces our costs going forward.  In the fourth quarter, we had an investment loss of $4 million. In the first quarter of 2012, we anticipate that investment income will be similar to the first quarter of last year, which was $19 million. Looking at taxes, as you know, the adjusted tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter primarily due to our geographic mix of earnings and discreet items such as audit settlements and valuation allowances. ","For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 30% and we feel a tax rate of between 30% and 31% is reasonable for financial modeling purposes in 2012. Discontinued operations for 2011 of $33 million includes a credit of $50 million relating to the sales of Putnam and Kroll, the bulk of which relates to Putnam. At the time of the sales, we provided certain indemnities primarily related to tax uncertainties and legal contingencies. The credit results from the resolution of tax and legal matters as well as insurance recoveries. Also affecting discontinued operations is the impact of Marsh's decision to sell its life insurance BPO unit. ","This unit provides policy, claims, call center and accounting operations to life insurance companies. Marsh ceased investing in and is selling the BPO business. Capitalized software of $17 million net of tax was written off in 2011. These items are described more fully in the supplemental schedules in our press release. ","Now let me make a few observations regarding pensions. We have seen marked increases in our reported pension expense over the past 3 years, primarily due to declining discount rates as well as the impact of asset losses in 2008. At year end 2011, interest rates for longer debt maturities used to measure pension liabilities were significantly lower than the prior year. The accounting for pensions is extremely complicated. In addition to the effective discount rates and asset returns, annual pension expense reflects the impact of factors such as salary increases over many years, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and cash contributions to name a few.  Based on our year end measurement, which takes all of these factors into account, pension expense in 2012 will increase. Net of bonuses and other mitigating items, operating income will be reduced by approximately $20 million or $0.025 per share for 2012. ","Moving to capital management. Our cash position increased substantially throughout the year, reflecting the strong earnings power of the company. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter included $120 million for dividends and $121 million for acquisitions, including Seitlin and a partial funding of Alexander Forbes. ","For the year, major discretionary uses of cash included $480 million for dividends, $361 million for share repurchases, $258 million for acquisitions, $100 million for the reduction of debt in July and $72 million of expense related to that early extinguishment of debt. Year-end cash was $2.1 billion. In the first quarter, anticipated uses of cash include the annual payment of incentive compensation awards, our regular quarterly dividend of approximately $120 million, about $100 million for acquisitions, including the remaining portion of the insurance broking operations of Alexander Forbes and a $100 million tax-deductible discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan. ","We also have a $250 million senior note maturing in March. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility regarding the funding of this maturity. At the end of the year, our net debt was $815 million. This is our lowest level of net debt at year end since 1996, which speaks to our efforts in strengthening our balance sheet. With that, I'll turn it back to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks, Vanessa. Operator, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Mr. Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question, I guess, Dan in your commentary -- or this question's for Dan or Vanessa, you mentioned absorbing additional severance costs in the brokerage margin. Now, but you do breakout restructuring and Consulting and corporate this quarter. So I guess the question is what's the dollar amount threshold to when this gets excluded from adjusted EPS?","Brian Duperreault","Vanessa, why don't you take that?","Vanessa A. Wittman","Sure. So Keith, the way that we have approached restructuring is that if there are permanent changes to the business, then it meets our threshold for restructuring. And if there are changes that may be temporary or the dollar\u2019s being reinvested, then it runs through earnings. So it isn't really a dollar threshold, but a function of what's being changed.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question's for Alex. A lot of news reports about the 1 1 renewal with some large insurers retaining a lot more coverage and buying less reinsurance. Can you talk a little bit about how, if any, impact that would have on your organic revenues as I believe they were clients of yours?","Alexander S. Moczarksi","First of all, obviously, yes, we have seen rate increases, rate on line on catastrophic property in general somewhere between 5% and 15% on even loss-free contracts. Companies are -- they do have budgets vis-\u00e0-vis what they buy. Also we have fee business. We have cats and remuneration. So we will expect to have some tailwind, but it's not going to be proportional to the rate increases and I'll take that little bit of wind any day.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering more on the Marsh side if you could talk about the impact on pricing -- from pricing on your revenue. It feels as if listening to the company and listening to the dialogue in the industry that things are getting better. It did seem as if your underlying growth slowed basically in every region versus the third quarter. I know quarter-to-quarter, sometimes your comparisons get distorted, but what's happening from a pricing standpoint? Is there more of a benefit now than there was, say, earlier in the year?","Brian Duperreault","I think Peter should take that, Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. There absolutely is a trend of rate improving when you look at earlier in the year as well as year-over-year. We generally speak about a theme of rate stabilization, but you need to really break it down into components. You need to break it down to geography, segment of business and then also size. If you look at the segments of business, property is clearly the one line of business that's having the most rate impact and we saw that in our own portfolio within Q4. Cat-exposed areas like Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Chile and Thailand are having the impacts. And if you go to you geography, it's really the U.S. and Asia-Pacific that are having the biggest impact. There's more lines of business. So, for instance, in the U.S., we've seen property, workers comp, as well as excess casualty and general liability starting to increase, and we'll see that trend probably into 2012. But when looking at the rest of the international geography, there are still headwinds particularly in casualty where rates are stable, improving, but still generally speaking, down year-over-year. So when I look at the U.K., parts of Europe and Asia, there's still a little bit of a headwind. So you really need to look at the overall composite.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just to follow up, given that throughout the year, let's take the U.S., where the rating environment didn't get better, I guess I was a little surprised to see the organic growth rates slow in the fourth quarter. Was anything unusual that impacted the year-over-year comparison at all?","Peter Zaffino","Yes, in the U.S., I think our performance is actually better than the 2% and I'll tell you why, we had for some reason a lot more one-time items in Q4 of 2010 that came off, and so they had a bigger hurdle in terms of growth. And then they also had some impact on rate but in our U.S. business, we have a consumer business, we also have stars and they didn't probably see the composite rate lift that the traditional part of the U.S. did. So I think the performance is actually better than the 2 and again, we just had some one-time items that we had to overcome from 2010.","Operator","And we will go next to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Vanessa, when you give higher tax rate guidance for 2012 compared to 2011, does that reflect optimism in terms of the U.S.?","Vanessa A. Wittman","I'm sorry, Meyer, I didn't hear your- - the last part. You said -- can you just repeat the question? I'm sorry.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. Should we interpret the higher tax rate guidance in 2012 relative to 2011 despite faster growth outside the U.S. as a reflection of greater optimism regarding domestic earnings?","Vanessa A. Wittman","Actually, we're fairly consistent, '11 to '12, Meyer. We just -- we can't pinpoint it precisely for you because we can't predict the exact mix of earnings. So we had guided between 30% and 31% for '11 and we're giving the same guidance for '12.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Shouldn't I expect it to go down as international operations grow a little bit faster than the domestic ones though?","Vanessa A. Wittman","Well, that also is -- yes, except for the fact that if you repatriate earnings back to the U.S., you're subjected to the U.S. tax rate.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, good point. And second question if I can, is there any way of ball parking the impacts of the life insurance BPO business on recent either organic growth or margins?","Vanessa A. Wittman","It was a small revenue business and I would say it has a de minimis impact on either revenue or margin in both the quarter and then the year-over-year.","Operator","And we will go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up on Meyer's question on taxes for next year. Clearly, your peers have now either moved or are in the process of moving to a more favorable tax jurisdiction possibly putting you at a slight disadvantage from that sense. Is that something you're thinking about?","Brian Duperreault","Yaron, this is Brian. You know what? I guess I'm not surprised by the question, but I'm not going to talk about what other companies do or speculate about what we might or might not do, so I'm really not going to comment.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Yes, and then maybe talking about the -- about Julio\u2019s appointment at Mercer. This is now the second CEO appointment that comes from somebody from outside of the industry, outside of the Consulting industry at least. What does that mean about the talent pool or the executive base at Mercer today? How are you thinking about that and with a P&C veteran coming in, how long will it take before Julio is really ready to make some initiatives and changes in the business?","Brian Duperreault","Okay, and I think Dan wants to take this question.","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, first of all, we ran an exhaustive search and we looked at both internal candidates and external candidates and we had several strong internal candidates. So really, the way we phrase this in terms of how we were looking at it, we really wanted to find someone truly exceptional that would be able to not only drive Mercer to better performance, but also contribute at the executive committee level of Marsh & McLennan, and so I'm very happy with where we have landed. I've known Julio for more than 10 years. We've worked together at AIG and Julio brings all -- 5 of our 6 members of our operating company and leadership team with Brian and I have experience both on the insurance company side and on the brokerage side. Julio has that, but also adds an additional dimension in that he has experience in the consumer businesses and in health and benefit, having run one of the largest health and benefits organizations in the world in AIU Accident & Health. So really, the driver for us was getting somebody who had deep experience in running large global businesses, had a lot of experience in running a matrix environment on a global basis, was well-schooled in P&L management and running a business from -- always having revenue exceed expense, and really a track record where every job over the course of a 30-year career was more successful than the one before. So in addition to a lot of inspirational and personal leadership characteristics, I think I'm very comfortable that Julio will be a great addition. Now how long it will take him to be fully up to speed, I would give it another 2 weeks, because he\u2019s hit the ground running and based upon his questions, he's getting there in a fast pace.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to set the baseline for 2012 earnings. Should we be thinking as in terms of $1.77 of adjusted earnings per share plus the $0.09 impact from debt extinguishment cost in 2011, so the baseline, the starting point is more like $1.86 and double-digit earnings growth off that?","Brian Duperreault","Jay, that's the way I'm looking at it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the risk capital holdings, it was -- so you're saying $19 million in the first quarter. It was $9 million for all of 2011. Should we expect a better result in '12?","Vanessa A. Wittman","Jay, that one\u2019s too difficult to call. We've really seen a lot of volatility over the course of 2011 and no reason not to expect the similar volatility. We can -- we give you what we have as we've got it because we report on a one quarter lag. We saw a very low number, a negative number in Q4, which was really on the back of the horrible equity markets in Q3. And then we -- for Q1, we saw the equity markets recover in Q4 and that's reflected in that -- in the $19 million number we gave you.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So I mean, if equity -- let's cross our fingers, if equity market stays strong in 1Q, that should be pretty good for second quarter results then right?","Brian Duperreault","Well, your guess is as good as ours. I don't know. It's hard to speculate, it really is, Jay. I wish we could give more, but it's not something we have control of so...","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I understand. And then for Peter, we had overall modest margin expansion in Risk and Insurance Services for all of 2011, what are the levers you have to generate margin expansion again in 2012?","Peter Zaffino","Well, certainly, we're going to continue on the path of having very strong client retention, very strong new businesses, as Dan said in his comments. We had over $1 billion of new business. We've been investing in 2011 for the future of 2012 and make sure that we're going to position our businesses for strong top line growth while controlling expenses. And we've had a lot of strong growth across the world. Dan gave you the quarter numbers, but for Latin America, we had 14% organic growth for the year. Asia Pac was 9%. EMEA was 4% and so we want to continue to focus on high-growth areas and make sure our investments are yielding that type of benefit on the top line and bottom line. So we're very well-positioned for 2012.","Brian Duperreault","And maintain expense control. Alex is a part of this segment. Well, Alex, why don't you add to that?","Alexander S. Moczarksi","Yes, it's pretty similar to Pete's -- Peter's. We've got a good revenue pipeline. Our expense discipline is good. Again, the overseas, the international piece is exciting. Also on the facultative side, we see good growth. So we're cautiously optimistic we'll continue to improve the margin.","Operator","We'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","I have kind of a Consulting and maybe it's a corporate question combined. We're hearing that some of the retirement annuity companies are offering annuity products as a solution for defined benefit pension plans. And I'm just wondering if from a corporate standpoint, if that's something that you've looked at and maybe from a Consulting standpoint, is that a product that you guys believe in? Is it a product that you recommend? Is it a product that competes with your business? Just curious how that fits into the grand scheme of things.","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, I'll take that, Larry. So it's Dan here. A couple of things, one, clearly, those type of products, the large annuity products and pension buyouts, so to speak, have been around for about 20 years, but they've gone through cycles of when they become more attractive to companies. We're definitely in the mix with regard to not only creating those sorts of products, but also advising clients on when it's appropriate to purchase some of that type of product. And particularly, there's been a fair amount of activity in the U.K. and I would say that we're one of the market leaders in the U.K. on that type of thing. It's a de-risking approach. And so from that standpoint, oftentimes, when a DB plan closes and freezes, then it transfers in terms of responsibility from, say, the HR, Senior HR Officer to the CFO, and the CFO often would look at, well, how can we bring the risk down on a frozen plan, and so we've been very actively engaged in that. We don't think of that as a competitor to our capabilities. We view that as one of the arrows that we have in our quiver to serve clients.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","And is it something that you've considered from a corporate standpoint?","Peter Zaffino","Well, yes, I would answer that. I mean, we certainly -- we look at all the different possibilities for our plan. Our plan is not frozen, and we are constantly looking at it to make sure there's a proper balance of risk. So it might be a product we could look at, but I think the way we're handling the plan now is appropriate for us.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Okay. So Dan, I infer from what you're saying. There's really not something terribly new that\u2019s hit the market in the last year or 2 relative to the things that have been available for a while?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, what you've seen is product innovation, but not new product. And so there's nuance differences between the kinds of products available today and the kinds of products that were available 20 years ago. I think what you're really seeing is the effect of having deep asset reductions and some level of recovery and certain companies staying with that level of recovery that we don't want to have risk of a deep asset reduction again, so let's de-risk our plan.","Operator","And we'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Mercer, it seemed like most segments the underlying revenue growth was down somewhat from the last couple of quarters. Is that being driven by Europe?","Brian Duperreault","Dan, can you do that?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, so as you can appreciate, there is some movement around in all of our segments in particular on the Consulting segment from quarter-to-quarter. So when I look at the full year of 2011, I'll start with the basis that we saw a double-digit growth in earnings in the segment and in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. Specifically, with regard to the fourth quarter, it wasn't abnormal reaction from Europe resulting in the result of it being 2% growth and actually areas that -- for example, retirement, which last year was minus 3% and is minus 1% for the year actually grew 1% in the fourth quarter. So when I look at the drop in sequential growth rate in the fourth quarter, I don't see that as establishing any new kind of trend for Mercer. I would more look at the year, which grew at about 4% as being more indicative of where the business is performing.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And just one quick follow-up. On margins, you showed nice steady progress in both businesses, up 40 basis points. Can we expect nice, steady progress again in 2012?","Brian Duperreault","I would say, Adam, that our primary focus is on growing our net operating income. That's our focus and that's the thesis we put forward at the Investor Day, so that's where we're going. Now, if you look at segments, given our view of 2012, I think that's going to result in margin improvement in both segments. But I got to tell you that to me, the margin is -- it's a result of the work being done to get growth organically in our top line and managing our expenses, and so it's a result, put it that way.  We're primarily focused on increasing our income.","Operator","And we will go next to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","So I guess a question on M&A. Should we expect, I mean, maybe excluding the Marsh & McLennan Agency strategy and sort of the M&A going forward there, should we expect acquisition going forward to reflect sort of non-U.S. acquisitions as opposed to looking at some M&A in the U.S.?","Brian Duperreault","Not necessarily. No, I mean, we're certainly interested in balancing out geographically. We're balancing out our capability and we're looking for great acquisitions. We're looking for really top-notch companies to join us and maybe in the U.S. it would be nice if they were. So we have a nice pipeline and we'll see where they come from. [indiscernible] emphasis on that geography.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then maybe just going back, Brian, to your 4 pillars of success for the company, I mean, you've spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth, controlling expenses and growth in operating income. But I guess could you provide a little bit more color on kind of where the risk profile of the overall organization is? And maybe point to some specific things that you guys have done over the past 1.5 years, 2 years to address sort of the risk profile of the business?","Brian Duperreault","Sure, I'd be happy to. We think the first line of defense is producing a product that's a quality product that's what the client has needed, and then we have agreed to deliver and we deliver that product as promised. And so that means real professionalism in our work. It's attention to detail. It's an operational thing and there's been a lot of work done on both Consulting and Risk and Insurance to improve the way we handle our business processes, our business. It produces efficiencies. It produces better expense levels for us, but it also produces a better-quality product. That's our first line of defense. Our E&O [ph] risks are our largest risks. So a lot of progress there and I think you can -- we'll see it. We can see that in our own results, so without getting into details, we do see that in our levels of activity of issues that we have to deal with. We've de-risked our balance sheet. We've talked a lot about that. That's an important component. We have a lot of cash flexibility, debt flexibility. The other line of defense is really after the fact with the limits of liability and we've -- we were the first to institute limits of liability, and we've got it on both the Consulting and Risk and Insurance now. So I'd say that's been a very successful program for us and I think appropriate for where we are, so -- and there's, I guess, another thing to talk about I probably ought to emphasize is when we're delivering our products, we spend a lot of time in reviewing those, peer reviews to make sure that it is of the highest quality and delivering the promises that we have made to the client. So all of those combined, I think, has delivered a great result and the one thing -- the last thing I want to point out is we redid our code of conduct this year, and that could be a pretty dry thing. We wanted it to be alive, embedded as part of the psyche of the company. We call it The Greater Good. It's something that I'm so proud of and there's a film that we produced around that, I think, is extraordinary. It's won some awards. But most importantly, I think just the way we go about our work now, doing the right thing, producing the business in the best possible way is really part of who we are, part of our culture. So all of those combined, I think, has really taken a big part of the risk of this company out.","Operator","And we will go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Vanessa, one question was on -- you kind of walked through the cash contributions for -- or cash-outs for 2011. I thought that in the K, you\u2019d said you expected to fund $300 million or so in the pension in '11. You didn't mention that. I don't know if that's because those were nondiscretionary contributions or -- if you could help me with that, I'd appreciate it.","Vanessa A. Wittman","Sure, the -- what I called out was specifically the discretionary contributions in 2011. Our contributions to the U.S. and the U.K. plan for the last couple of years have run about $300 million, $320 million. And then on top of that, last year, we had $100 million. I mentioned that we have already committed $100 million of discretionary funding for 2012 and obviously, we'll maintain our flexibility about making further discretionary contributions over time.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then did the pension status factor into your decision not to buy back stock in the fourth quarter? And if it didn't, what drove that decision?","Vanessa A. Wittman","Sure, the pension did not drive the -- have any interplay with the share buyback decision in the fourth quarter. As we've said all along, our share buyback plan and our uses of cash, it will first go to accretive acquisitions. And in the fourth quarter, we had -- we were uncertain of the timing around the closing of the Alexander Forbes transaction, which we had a partial funding of in the fourth quarter, and we'll have the rest of the funding in the first quarter. But that timing was uncertain until very late in the quarter, so we stayed out of the market from a share repurchase perspective.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see, okay. And then just one follow-up if I could. Maybe Dan or maybe Brian, if you could talk a little bit about just the pipeline in Europe both on the brokerage and Consulting side? And I guess more on the Consulting side. How is that looking today versus the end of the third quarter or late last year?","Brian Duperreault","I want to make sure, the pipeline of what?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just business activity, so on the Consulting side project.","Brian Duperreault","Business activity?  Okay, well, why don't we start with John? He can tell us about Oliver Wyman.","John Drzik","Yes, so on the fourth quarter or the previous earnings call, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we had signaled that there was some weakness in our European business, particularly, in financial services. I think we see that continuing a little bit into the first quarter of this coming year in 2012. So looking ahead to the whole of 2012, I think we're seeing a macroeconomic environment that's broadly similar to what we saw in 2010 and 2011, and our expectations for our business growth are similar to the last couple of years that we think we'll stay in general on that similar trajectory. Although for the first quarter, in particular, the carryover -- there will be a little bit of carryover from the weakness in Europe in the fourth quarter into the first.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So your baseline there is for Oliver Wyman is an environment in Europe and economic backdrop in Europe that's similar to 2010 and 2011?","John Drzik","I think the global environment and the developed world environment as a whole we're seeing is similar to 2010 and 2011, probably a little stronger in the U.S., a little weaker in Europe, overall the picture for 2012.","Brian Duperreault","Dan can talk about Mercer.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, it's kind of interesting in that if you look at our fourth quarter as an example and we look at countries, which had greater than 5% organic growth, you might see some surprises on that list. As an example, Portugal, Italy, Finland, Norway, Spain and Ireland all grew more than 5% in the fourth quarter. So oftentimes, the macro environment, while it may have an impact, it may not appear right away and it may it not be something that is a direct result of, say, macro factors or GDP factors in terms of what is actually driving Mercer\u2019s growth.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And they're also your baseline expectation for Europe is similar as John's, kind of a 2010, 2011 sort of backdrop?","Daniel S. Glaser","I mean, basically, what we try to look at country by country is GDP growth and that our goal is to outgrow GDP. And when we're outgrowing GDP, we think we're doing well. And so when we look at -- as we've done this year, where we've had reasonable growth in both the RIS segment and also in Consulting in Europe, we would expect that to continue.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So a little overlap with the prior question, I think. But so for 2012, should we expect outsourcing segment revenue growth to remain weak? And on the other hand, should we expect Talent, Rewards & Communication to remain strong? Any color on those 2 would be helpful.","Daniel S. Glaser","I mean, as we go through our planning and we look forward in the year, bearing in mind we're only in mid-February, and so we're looking out over the whole year. But in terms of what we have seen over the past couple of years, we've seen very strong growth in Talent, Rewards & Communications investments in H&B, some weakness in retirement, which started to abate a little bit by the end of the year, but it's still a tough environment. And with respect to outsourcing, outsourcing was flat in the overall year and as we approach next year, we're hoping to generate low single-digit growth in outsourcing, but it's a competitive environment for a lot of different reasons, and so we're not expecting any kind of significant levels of growth out of outsourcing.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in talent, rewards, is that coming from a specific sector and\/or geography?","Daniel S. Glaser","It's pretty well-spaced geographically. I mean if you take a step back and just think about what are the kinds of concern \"C\" suites around the world, it tends to be the same things, right? It's a macro factor, it's innovation, it's risks and it's also talent management. There -- even though unemployment levels are high in many countries, the reality is for skilled positions and for critical positions, actually, there's a war for talent out there and so we are -- we advise across the human capital spectrum not only on rewards talent management, which includes everything for paper performance kinds of issues, performance appraisals, colleague engagement surveys of -- compensation surveys broadly, et cetera. So when we look at our Talent, Rewards & Communications segment, there are many sub-segments to it and they're all actually doing quite well.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay and lastly for Vanessa, just to clarify in your prepared remarks regarding the pension expense, it's $20 million higher in fiscal year 2012 expected versus 2011?","Vanessa A. Wittman","That was the operating income impact, so it is net of bonus, et cetera. It will roll down to $20 million at the operating income level or $0.025 a share.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","You commented a little bit about the impact of pricing on organic growth. I was wondering if you could just talk about where premium audit sort of stand right now in the comparisons, if there's sort of a flattening out versus a headwind, if they're slightly positive?","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Yes, I think at this point, there's really no trend. We haven't seen many decreases from any economic conditions and we haven't really seen much in terms of increases from inflation. Certainly, insured values are going up in areas where there's high inflation. But generally speaking, on the portfolio, it's neutral.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then could you maybe update us on your growth efforts within the Marsh Agency business, maybe just talk a little bit about deal pipeline, competition for deals, things like that?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. We feel as we've commented in prior quarter's and Dan has in his opening comments that we're very pleased with where we are to date just acquiring Seitlin, again, another geographical expansion with a high-quality agency is another step forward to building out our plans over a 3- to 5-year period. The pipeline is strong, but we're very careful in terms of looking at opportunities that are going to give us a either geographical expansion or a product line expansion. And so I think you can see us continue that pattern over the next 12 to 24 months. Having said all that, we're going to be very careful in terms of what properties we're going to go after. The pipeline is very strong. But again, there's no timeline on when we're going to make these acquisitions.","Brian Duperreault","Good, well, let me wrap this by saying we had an outstanding year last year, an outstanding year. And I want to thank first, take the opportunity to thank our clients for all the business they give us and I very much want to thank all of our talented colleagues out there for your hard work and continued dedication to the company.

Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO Mark McGivney, Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of the Risk and Insurance Services, Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer, Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman and Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The UK vote to exit the EU created immediate uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we\u2019ve seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the UK\u2019s decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty.","MMC\u2019s top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the UK and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advice around key issues such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements, and the need to restructure UK operations in light of negotiations on passporting and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations.","One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global sector of insurance and, in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients, regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the UK, we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU.","We view capital as fungible, and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing, terms and conditions and access to capacity in the market. In the short term, the uncertainty in the UK will likely cause some clients to defer projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the UK and Continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally.","Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassessed their risk and insurance needs as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients will seek Mercer\u2019s assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment and asset allocation strategic advice.","Oliver Wyman will play a key role helping clients with corporate strategy as they consider their competitive positioning throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their UK operations. I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains favorable for clients, as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh global rate index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies, with the steepest declines in the UK and U.S. property.","On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on cat pre-announcements among underwriters. However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets, with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers, as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade a favorable development.","All together, this translates into returns likely below the cost of capital net of reserve releases for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing, though it may take some time. To be clear, we don\u2019t anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments and, in fact, will actually write more new business when rates are falling than when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call.","While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there is an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: service, breadth of products, coverage innovation, contract certainty, claims performance, responsiveness, and, yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet the growing risk needs of our clients. And this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver.","On the healthcare side, we\u2019ve seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block two possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted advisor regardless of the outcome of these proposed mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families.","Now, let me turn to our results. MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all four of our operating companies, margin expansion, and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC\u2019s revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3%, with excellent growth in profitability. Operating income rose 15% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the six-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4% with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share.","Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue increased 6%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double-digits, with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second-quarter margin since 1988. I\u2019m excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the president of Marsh, and Peter Hearn, the president and CEO of Guy Carpenter.","I\u2019m certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC. I would like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past five years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman, MMC International. The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter, with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5%, with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased by double-digits, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment\u2019s highest second-quarter margin in over 30 years.","In summary, we are pleased with our second-quarter results. We are a trusted advisor helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy, and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that has proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins, and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities. Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2015.","For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth to be within 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past six years. Meaningful margin expansion in both segments, and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13% \u2013 all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second-quarter results in more detail.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5%, and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double-digits, and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90, and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91.","Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million, with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisitions such as Jelf in the UK and continued activity in Marsh & McLennan Agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. Underlying growth was 4% in the International division. EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all regions.","Asia-Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 11%. In the U.S,","Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S, largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis, another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia-Pacific, EMEA, and Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth in 28 of the past 30 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion, or 5% on an underlying basis.","Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%. Mercer\u2019s revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 5%; Health increased 5%; and Retirement was up 2%. All major geographic regions contributed, led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $450 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both a reported and underlying basis.","Growth was well distributed, with particular strength in Europe and other international markets. In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the Financial Services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016 we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments, and strong growth in earnings per share. I\u2019d like to take a \u2013 make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the declines in global interest rates, we want to share some thoughts that might be helpful to investors.","We monitor our retirement programs on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that have reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expense as just one component of overall expense, which we actively manage. We have been effective at mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017. Moving to investment income, we recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015.","On our last earnings call we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. Weakening of the pound has a minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting.","Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1%, compared with 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8%, compared with 28.5% in last year\u2019s first half. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.","Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter due to a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility, with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is 250 million of senior notes due next April. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. Through six months we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marked the 70th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding nine quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%.","Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million, with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $155 million for dividends, and $47 million for acquisitions. For the first six months uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends, and $168 million for acquisitions. For the full-year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions, and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per s hare by double-digits.","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we\u2019re ready to turn to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. On the brokerage organic growth, I think you said last quarter the 2% was tempered by the profile of the book that renewed that quarter. This quarter I was a little surprised that it didn\u2019t rebound. Was there anything that was tempering it again?","Dan Glaser","Well, before I hand over to Peter, I would just say that in general when you look at the size of Marsh, it\u2019s in every country which has an insurance profile, many different segments, many different moving parts within the business. So it really gets a very broad array of areas in which they can grow. Wherever there is growth, we\u2019re on the ground to capture it. But I think the reality is, as you\u2019ve seen from a lot of the insurance company reporting, it\u2019s a pretty tough market out there. The P&C rating levels are under a fair amount of pressure. There\u2019s a significant amount of competition amongst brokers, et cetera, which is having an impact. But I do think you have to look at it on a mix basis. International did quite well; U.S.\/Canada was under a bit more pressure. But Peter, you want to give us some more color on this?","Peter Zaffino","Sure, Dan. Just to pick up on what you just said, International I think we had a terrific quarter, strong organic growth in all major geographies. Some of the highlights were: Latin America we had 11% underlying organic growth, but also over 15% new business growth. We had some real strong performances in Asia. And in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter was terrific, and it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If we go and shift into the U.S. and Canada, again each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we\u2019re not pleased with 0% growth in the quarter, but it is just one quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are some of the fundamentals we look at? Certainly the renewal book; and when we look at client retention it was at historic highs. We\u2019ve done really well, strong new business.","The challenge is we had a really tough comparable year-over-year on new business in the U.S. and Canada division. It was a record in the second quarter of 2015; we had a lot more nonrecurring new business than we have had historically. We matched that new business in this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business did have an impact of not having the renewal line grow as much as we\u2019ve seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past: project work which does mute a little bit of the new business. And despite the cats that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind.","And then just one last comment on another variable \u2013 Dan mentioned it in his opening comments \u2013 is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business, and the underlying performance of the fundamentals, and I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year","Dan Glaser","Yes. The other thing I would just say, Sarah, would be this was not a surprise to Peter and the Marsh team, as you see by the expanded margin within RIS. So this has been \u2013 this was planned for in terms of what we saw six months ago as a likely outcome on the top line. Any other questions?","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Yes, and then just following up on the RIS margin, could you just elaborate on what\u2019s driving that strong growth, given the 2% organic?","Dan Glaser","Well, what we said about margins in the past is you really shouldn\u2019t look at any individual quarter; that certainly on a year-to-date basis when we get further along in the year or on a rolling four-quarters basis is the best way to look at margins. The reality is both RIS and Consulting, we have had significant efficiency gains over multiple periods of time. So when we look at the expansion of the margins, it\u2019s been pretty consistent over multiple years. I was just looking the other day in the second quarter over a five-year period: the margin for RIS is up almost 500 basis points, and for Consulting about 600 basis points. So there has been a consistent level of significant margin expansion. We expect 2015 to be a good year for margin expansion, despite the slow growth environment within RIS.","Sarah DeWitt","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg","Hi, good morning. I guess this one\u2019s for Peter, too. It seems like there\u2019s more activity for major quota shares going on. I\u2019m just curious if that impression is correct. And if so, what\u2019s driving it? Is it nothing more than the softness in the reinsurance markets and accommodations being made there?","Dan Glaser","A couple of things and then I\u2019ll hand off to Peter, Larry. The one thing you have to know is that organizations like Marsh and others are always searching for ways of delivering increased value to clients. And that value is both in the advisory side, which probably has had even more increased value to clients over the last several years than any other area; but it also touches the transactional side as well. And clearly, whether it\u2019s quota shares or specific types of facilities, there has been some level of increase in that over the last few years. Whether that is a permanent feature of the landscape or a factor of the current market conditions, time will tell. But, Peter, do you have something to add to that?","Peter Zaffino","Yes, I think, Dan, to add to what you said, our strategy with respect to any facilities, our quota shares is always to lead with client value, put together dedicated capacity where we think there\u2019s a need in the market. The most recent example for us is that we launched a terrorism facility, which is led by five very strong lead markets; we\u2019re able to put together $250 million of capacity for anywhere in the world from the leads, and then we have another $250 million of following capacity. So to be able to have $500 million of capacity for value for clients anywhere in the world really does generate value. And to do that on a syndicated individual basis would be near-on impossible for all of our clients across the world. So we\u2019re always focused on client value and bringing capacity to the market where there is need.","Larry Greenberg","Just \u2013 it seemed like a relatively quiet quarter on the acquisition front. But can you give us the breakdown of the $47 million between RIS and Consulting?","Dan Glaser","Yes. Mark, you want to?","Mark McGivney","Larry, a lot of the activity in the second quarter was actually subsequent payout on acquisitions, so deferred payments. There were just a couple of very minor acquisitions. Most of the activity was subsequent payments on \u2013 and largely MMA acquisitions.","Dan Glaser","But you\u2019re very right to identify that acquisitions through the first half of the year are not at the pace of what they were last year. I\u2019ll just remind everybody that we don\u2019t have any budget with regard to acquisitions. We look at a lot of things. We cultivate a lot of relationships. We have a lot of conversations. We don\u2019t do very much at all. Even over the past years we\u2019ve had a string-of-pearls strategy, and we\u2019re continuing on that basis. So acquisitions by their very nature are going to be lumpy. Some years we\u2019re going to have lots of them and some years we won\u2019t have that much. I can tell you the back half of last year was more active than the first half of last year.","I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good, but we\u2019re a disciplined acquirer. So what I can say is that if acquisitions are lighter than normal in any given year, we are not seeking to build cash on our balance sheet, so we would use that, those funds, in other ways of creating value, whether that\u2019s organic investment through strategic recruitment, whether that is increased share repurchase. That is \u2013 those are essentially avenues that we would take to make sure we\u2019re putting our cash to work.","Larry Greenberg","Appreciate those thoughts. Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Quentin McMillan with KBW.","Quentin McMillan","Hi, good morning. Thanks very much, guys. Just to touch to the other side of the equation, Julio, the margin expansion in the quarter was really pretty phenomenal. So could you just help us qualitatively? Maybe give an example of our programs you\u2019re working on to drive such high margin expansion. Then obviously Dan\u2019s commentary in the press release indicated that you\u2019re expecting meaningful margin expansion to continue. So again, just anything that can help us qualitatively understand what you guys are working on that\u2019s helping to drive that and into the future.","Dan Glaser","Okay, so before I hand over to Julio, I just want to remind you that the margins are for the segment, not for individual operating companies. So the Consulting segment\u2019s margins have expanded pretty dramatically, as I mentioned before, about 700 bps over the last five years, and there\u2019s a lot of factors to do with that. As we\u2019ve said in other calls in the past, the better the top-line performance, the better the opportunities for margin expansion certainly over time, over any stretch of time. But both Julio and Scott have done a number of things over the years to make sure that we\u2019re positioned well to expand margins into the future. Julio, you want to comment in more detail?","Julio Portalatin","Sure. Thank you, and thanks for the question. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, Mercer is a pretty broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. So you see things that we make conscious decisions, like disinvesting in things that don\u2019t give us the margin expansion or sustainability of profit contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest our DC record-keeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we continue to make active decisions like that.","Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really a faucet around, a discipline around higher utilization, use of offshoring as another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also, the evolving mix of our business. There\u2019s no question that as you look at the improvements in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being a more significant part of our mix. And that\u2019s going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. Our continuous portfolio review is also part of our discipline now.","We accelerate those things that give us margin accretiveness and we decelerate those things that don\u2019t. So it\u2019s really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we\u2019re building a business that can have strength both on the top line and the bottom line as we continue to grow. I just also want to mention that, importantly, our overall focus is still to increase and grow earnings. We\u2019re confident that with the actions that we\u2019ve taken and the actions that we continue to take, that we\u2019ll be successful in doing just that.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Julio. I just want to caution everybody not to overly focus on one quarter when it comes to margins. That at the end of the day, look over longer stretches of time. The Consulting segment is up about 50 bps on a year-to-date basis. We expect that to improve over the course of the year, but we certainly don\u2019t look at the 230 bps margin expansion in the quarter as being some sort of new run rate for the Consulting division. Your next question, please?","Quentin McMillan","Understood. Thanks very much for the color. One other quick question. Peter, you mentioned the historically high retention that you had in the quarter; but also talked about nonrecurring business. I know those are two separate things, but can you help us to understand how much of the book is business that you guys view as nonrecurring? And\/or what is the typical type of nonrecurring business versus the rest of the book?","Dan Glaser","I\u2019ll just take that a little bit and then hand over to Peter. I mean the one thing to bear in mind when we talk about client retention is retaining the client. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the income for that client is exactly what it was the year before. But, Peter, I don\u2019t think we want to go into detail about recurring revenues and that sort of thing. But [indiscernible]","Peter Zaffino","No. I\u2019ll just give one example. Construction or surety, there can be some project work; there could be some work within the private equity space that we have a very good business with in the United States. So if there\u2019s more activity on new business in one particular quarter, that is a nonrecurring piece of the business. So we want to be very active in the construction business and private equity and make sure that we\u2019re capturing all the new business opportunities. But that\u2019s not the same as winning a property deal that will go into client retention and then renewal retention the following year. So that was a little bit more color on my comments from earlier. Thanks.","Quentin McMillan","Great; that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. Just want to talk a little bit more about U.S. and Canada. Obviously the organic was flat. But when I look back further, revenue in that geography is up like 30% in the last four years, which is, I think, better than any other subset in your business over that period. I\u2019m guessing, obviously, MMC Agency is a big chunk of that. So I\u2019m just trying to think about margins. Normally we think about margins relative to organic growth. But here, given the trajectory of margins in the segment, I\u2019m guessing margins have expanded in the U.S. and Canada as well over that period. How should we think about the trajectory for the U.S.\/Canada business? How much more important are acquisitions here relative to organic when we think about top line, when we think about bottom line?","Dan Glaser","Well, there\u2019s a couple of things. One, yes, you\u2019re right when you\u2019re looking at the overall revenue growth in U.S. and Canada; that is inclusive of acquisitions. And in fact, Marsh had a strong quarter on overall growth, and that really varies based upon the acquisitions which were done in the prior year. Clearly, one of the core strategic initiatives of the Company since 2009 has been the development of Marsh & McLennan Agency. And you can see through the contingent payments that we\u2019ve made over the last several years that the Agency is \u2013 many parts of the Agency are performing better than what our expectations were when we acquired different agents. So, yes, there is \u2013 where you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly the combination of active acquisitions, performance, and efficiency gains through acquisitions, combined with organic would have an impact on margin.","I think it\u2019s important \u2013 we talk about margins often, and we all recognize around this table that margins are an important feature. Margin expansion is an important feature of us delivering on our long-term CAGR of EPS of 13%. Having said that, I do want to reiterate to everybody that margins are about the last thing we talk about at an executive team level. We spend a lot of time on financial performance, organic growth strategies, acquisition strategies, people issues, risk issues. We believe that margin expansion is an outcome of running our business properly, not a goal in and of itself. So I just want to level-set with that. Peter, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else to add to that.","Peter Zaffino","The only thing I would add is that the acquisition strategy is important to us, but that is not in lieu of growing each of our businesses organically. We focus on what investments we need to make in each of the components of our U.S. and Canada business in terms of how they can grow irrespective of acquisitions. But we have an active acquisition strategy where we have a very strong pipeline and believe that will supplement the organic growth in the U.S. and Canada Division.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it, thanks. I guess, so in thinking about that, the US\/Canada then, is acquisition growth maybe not a driver, but is it an ingredient to margin expansion if you don\u2019t have consistent organic growth? Does it help? Is it a tailwind to margin expansion?","Dan Glaser","Well, certainly, acquisitions done well and quality acquisitions that have higher growth than what your expectations were will create more value. But overall, I\u2019ve got to tell you, Marsh & McLennan Agency has been a headwind to margin expansion for the segment. When you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margin for the greater segment. So from that perspective, over time that will become more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins.","And Peter and his team have proven \u2013 because even if you look over the last number of years \u2013 forgetting about the 2% growth within Marsh the last couple of quarters \u2013 Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But, knowing where we\u2019re going to be, looking out into the future where we\u2019re likely to be, and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where, in virtually every quarter, our revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s purposeful. We know it, we plan for it, and we decide to do it. So we\u2019re not beholden to the fact that that it always have to happen that way. In fact, Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or recruitment-wise, we will always go into the tank expense-wise to build a better business. So that is part of what we\u2019re willing to do. But we\u2019re seeking those opportunities. They don\u2019t avail themselves all that often. So the net effect of running the business on a consistent basis where revenue growth exceeds expense growth means we\u2019ll always have margin expansion.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it, great. And if I could sneak in a quick one just on the Consulting segment. I think, Mark, you mentioned about Oliver Wyman impact from Brexit in the UK. Any impact on Mercer that we should think about, or offsetting impact, just to keep in line with your outlook for mid-single-digit organic growth and margin expansion? Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Let me hand off to Scott a little bit just to talk a \u2013 give you a little bit more flavor on Oliver Wyman, which obviously over the last several years has been our fastest-growing operating company. But we\u2019ve said many times in the past it will be our most volatile operating company as well because of the nature of its business. And then after Scott, we\u2019ll hand over to Julio and just talk a little bit about Brexit and what you\u2019re seeing at Mercer?","Julio Portalatin","Sure. Let me give you some context before I go straight to the third quarter. I mean, Oliver Wyman is a strong business and we\u2019re very confident that over time we can grow it at mid to high single-digits, as we\u2019ve indicated consistently. However, quarter-to-quarter there will be a fair bit of volatility. And the reason for that is that the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth, like you\u2019ve seen in first quarter of this year or through 2014; but we can also have some downside volatility.","In addition to that, we\u2019ve had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman, setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline That comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we\u2019re feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectations, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. We still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness, and the business still feels very sound. So we\u2019re expecting the dip to be short-term, although it may take a quarter or two to work out.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Scott. Julio, you want to talk a little bit about Brexit and what he\u2019s seeing right now within Mercer. So","Julio Portalatin","Yes, sure. I mean, I think there is a lot of continued uncertainty, of course, around Brexit and the short-as well as long-term implications of such. In the early days, as you can imagine, there\u2019s a significant amount of discussions that are taking place with our primary clients around things like workforce planning, what\u2019s going to happen if migrant issues are resolved one way or the other, what potentially could happen in terms of the investment strategy going forward for pensions. And all of that we are actively involved in. Throughout those discussions you can imagine there\u2019s a bit of a slowdown in terms of their discretionary spend until the path is clearer and until we have an opportunity to propose some strategy on how to go forward.","But let me clarify that. Increased uncertainty and market volatility will likely create some opportunities for us and as clients are going to look for advice, of course, to manage in that uncertain world and through the issues. So in the longer term, we look to develop these solutions, to continue to meet these emerging needs. And as I said, examples would be the potential changes in the flow of capital investments as well as in regulations with regard to workforce, benefits, and pension coverage","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Julio. And next question please.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning. Just one follow-up with Mark on the pension expenses. Given if interest rates stay at current levels, what\u2019s the magnitude of the potential impact relative to 2015, the $125 million? And would you be able to fully offset that, like, as you did in 2015?","Dan Glaser","So Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","Yes, Kai. Just a couple things. First on the sensitivity: as we said in our 10-K, roughly 50 basis points of discount rate change will have a $35 million or so impact on earnings. The reason we included the comments on pension is just because it is so topical. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions from investors, and it\u2019s hard to pick up a newspaper without reading something about it, given the low interest rate environment. So we just wanted to share where \u2013 how we\u2019re thinking about it right now and wanted to highlight what I just talked about, that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. If you go back a couple years ago, we closed our largest defined-benefit plan in the UK, we closed our Irish plan, and we made the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans.","So we have less sensitivity, so that\u2019s a factor. And remember what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. So although we\u2019ve seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks rates have come back a little bit. And asset values have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. So how we\u2019re looking at this, we\u2019re at the very beginning of our planning process, and as I said a few minutes ago pension expense is just one element of an overall expense base that we manage very actively. We manage to deliver a great result. So given where we are in the year, we can see this coming, we can plan under a number of scenarios. And based on where we see things today, we expect we\u2019ll be able to limit the impact of pension volatility on earnings just as we have for the last couple of years.","Dan Glaser","Anything else. Kai.","Kai Pan","Yes, another question for Julio probably on the Healthcare Exchange. Any update on that in terms of the clients\u2019 interest as well as your product design, and heading into the renewal season at the end of the year?","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Kai. Julio, you want to just take that one?","Julio Portalatin","Yes. As I said, Kai, in past calls, employers continue to look for solutions for long-term health trend reduction, and our Exchange is certainly one of those that we discuss actively. We\u2019re really focused on that and continue to be extending the platform beyond enrollment experience, so it\u2019s a full-year platform for employees to consult with. As mentioned in recent past, we see a lot of interest and a lot of discussions, but I would say that we\u2019re experiencing a softer conversion to sales than what we had originally anticipated for this selling season. We\u2019ll see how it comes out completely at the end, but certainly a little bit slower than we expected.","Kai Pan","Thank you","Dan Glaser","And we\u2019re going to have things on time. So next question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I just \u2013 going back to the commentary on the U.S. and Canada organic growth, I was particularly interested just how the MMA book performed in the quarter. I know over the past couple quarters you guys highlighted it as performing better than the rest of your business. Was that still the case in the second quarter? And did you also, I guess, see a slowdown within the growth within MMA in the Q2 as well?","Dan Glaser","Okay. We\u2019re not going to break out MMA in any kind of formal way. We have said in the past that our expectation was that it would grow faster than overall Marsh, and that we were comfortable that it was exceeding our expectations on that score. And it did so again in the second quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. Then just in terms of the margins that you saw in both of the segments, I know pension was a benefit \u2013 was a hit last year and a little bit of a benefit this year. Is there a way that we should be thinking about the impact that pension had on the Q2 margins, just in terms of how we think of the level of margin improvement for the balance of the year in both of the segments? Or would you just say it didn\u2019t have as much of an impact that we should really be backing that out?","Dan Glaser","I would look at it this way. That, one, just to reiterate, look over longer periods. So year-to-date and rolling four quarters are more accurate ways of looking at margin expansion. And even though we don\u2019t unpack pension, it\u2019s fair to say pension was a benefit. But we would have had significant margin expansion in both segments even without contemplating the pension credit that we had. So I would just look over longer periods as to where the likely run rate of expansion is.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. Then one last quick one. I noticed the level of capital expenditures slowed down in both quarters of this year. Anything \u2013 any comments on that front?","Dan Glaser","I\u2019ll hand off to Mark in a second, but projects can be lumpy as well. So from that standpoint, our capital expenditure over the last several years has been bounded in a $300 million to $400 million annual kind of spend; we\u2019re probably still in that area. Some projects are complicated, and we always prioritize. The best projects are the ones that are done well, and so that creates a little bit of a gating mechanism which has an impact. But, Mark, do you have anything else to add?","Mark McGivney","Yes, the only thing I would add, Elyse, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the slow start this year. It\u2019s more just timing of starting some big projects, mainly on the technology side. So we had $million of CapEx last year. We\u2019ll probably be a little bit less than that; but I still expect up in the high $200 million, $300 million range for the year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Elyse. Next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies","Dave Styblo","Good morning. Thanks for the questions and also appreciate the color on Brexit and the P&C market early on. Considering the conversation of MMA and so forth, you guys still obviously have a conservative balance sheet with debt-to-EBITDA; I think maybe it\u2019s around 1.6 right now. And my sense is you\u2019d like to maintain that just to be able to seize on opportunities as they arise. Can you give us maybe a little bit more color on \u2013 if you are seeing increased opportunities especially in light of the volatility in Brexit that might be surfacing now, that wouldn\u2019t have been there, say, three, six months ago? Or is it still going to continue to be the string-of-pearls strategy that you\u2019ve been executing in the past?","Dan Glaser","It\u2019s a good question, although we certainly wouldn\u2019t preannounce anything on a quarterly. Yes, but I don\u2019t know if you would or not. But ultimately what you\u2019re saying could very well happen. There could be opportunities in parts of the world based upon uncertainty, whether it\u2019s caused by Brexit or other factors, Clearly macro factors have a role to play in M&A and in continuing M&A. It\u2019s too early in looking at Brexit to see whether there\u2019s truly any new opportunities that are going to result from Brexit. But suffice to say that your basic premise of we\u2019re relatively comfortable at our level of leverage now, and that our level of leverage preserves the capability for us to capitalize on opportunities if they may appear sometime in the future, is accurate. We think we live in a pretty uncertain, volatile world. And in uncertain, volatile world and difficult conditions, they may be the best opportunities that you ever see. And we certainly want to preserve the ability to capitalize if they so appear. Next question, Dave.","Dave Styblo","Yes; so we\u2019ll stay tuned on that. Just coming back to the U.S.\/Canada, I want to look forward a little bit more instead of what\u2019s happened. The tougher comps that happened in the 2Q of last year for the nonrecurring, can you maybe speak to a little bit more of what happened in the second half of last year? If there\u2019s any particularly tough comps that we should just be aware of as we think about the rest of the year. And then what might change in Canada? Or how tough is the drag in Canada right now in regards to the commodity situation? Is this a structurally tough area until things turn around? Or do you see some light at the end of the tunnel where things are starting to improve?","Dan Glaser","Peter, you want to take that?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. Again, we could \u2013 if we spoke about the U.S. and Canada Division, going into each of its components would take a lot of time and we don\u2019t break them out. There\u2019s a lot of businesses. We have an MGA, we have a technology business, we have Canada, we have the core of Marsh. There\u2019s a lot of businesses in MMA that comprise of the Division. I\u2019m not going to really comment too much on the next couple of quarters. Don\u2019t think that we will be in the same situation that we are in the second quarter. Again, each one is different and the prior-year comparables are different. And each component of the U.S. and Canada Division has a bigger percentage of its participation depending on which quarter. So again, I just wouldn\u2019t over-read into what happened in the second quarter as a trend or that you\u2019re going to hear a similar story as we get to the back half of the year.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Peter","Dave Styblo","Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Next question please. Thanks David.","Operator","And we will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","My questions have been answered. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Jay. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. I just had a quick one. Just as it applies to Brexit, was there anything evident in the organic growth results this quarter, I guess just in anticipation of that vote, either clients deferring decisions or accelerating them, that may have in some way contributed to organic growth in either segment?","Dan Glaser","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t think so. Again, I don\u2019t think we have that level of granularity to know what\u2019s in a client\u2019s mind. I do believe that it\u2019s fair to say, Brexit or otherwise, that many of our clients believe that we are living in an age of risk and uncertainty, and that risk and uncertainty creates a dampening enthusiasm for projects and for investments. So that has had an impact over the last number of years, I think, on not only our growth levels but on GDP worldwide. But there was no negative or positive spike that we could actually see as a result of early-stage thoughts about Brexit","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Thanks for sneaking me in.","Dan Glaser","Okay, thanks. Next question, please","And will go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. Thank you. Dan, you made an interesting comment in your prepared remarks that RIS margins are as high as they\u2019ve been since 1988, a hard market year and high interest rates; and shows the operational efficiency gains made over that time. I\u2019m curious looking forward on not a quarter, not a year, what are the biggest levers for you guys to achieve opportunity or efficiency gains in your business on par with that, outside of just a pricing environment?","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Charles. I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s always funny comparing ourselves back into time. We are such a different Company than what we were back in 1988 that I am loath to create those comparisons even though we write them into our script. I would say we\u2019re better than at any time in our history. Because when I look back in 1988, if you look at total RIS it was $1.3 billion of revenue. So we are multiple times larger and more diverse geographically, line of business, quality, etc. So this is the new world. I don\u2019t set margin targets. Peter doesn\u2019t as well. We don\u2019t believe in them. We believe that there\u2019s something about the human brain that looks at a target as something to reach and then draw back from.","So I would not put any hurdle out there as to what this business could do and how it could perform. I do know that I\u2019m quite confident that the leading factor in how we will do over time is organic growth. And if we have good levels of organic growth, we will have good levels of margin expansion, period. If we don\u2019t have that organic growth, then all of our annual and multiyear search for efficiency \u2013 obviously that never ends. We have found different ways of running this business through structure, delayering, through technology, through better levels of client connectivity to create more ability for us to service clients on an efficient basis. And that creates a margin benefit to us go-forward. But do you have any other question, Charles.","Charles Sebaski","That is it. Thank you very much.","Dan Glaser","Okay. I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we will go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you for fitting me in at the end, everyone. I get a question a lot from investors that I don\u2019t have a good answer for, and I don\u2019t know how important it is to you; but the question is: What is the risk of disintermediation for the insurance brokerage industry over the long run? And how are you addressing it?","Dan Glaser","Yes, well, it\u2019s a question that I\u2019m used to. Because when I was joining the business in 1982, I was reading articles about brokerage disintermediation that had been written in 1978 and considering: Should I actually join an industry that looks like it\u2019s going to go the way of the dodo bird? The reality is, in an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. These were once transactional businesses; now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. So I would say the broad level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That\u2019s not saying that there\u2019s not ways of creating distribution that we as a Company have to be very focused on, whether it\u2019s digital, whether it\u2019s online, whether it\u2019s worksite.","There\u2019s different ways of getting to our client base, and we have to be very open to the idea. And clearly in some parts of segments I feel you\u2019ll have multichannels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial, you\u2019ll end up having multichannels, which means brokers, there will be direct, there will be affinity. There will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is: What\u2019s the client experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experience? And a little bit less about what the capital behind it is. It\u2019s more about experience.","I would just end with the thought as well, because I recently took a trip to a country which was always very much a nonbroker market which is beginning to turn more and more to a brokered market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokered, because the terms and conditions and the pricing are better in markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. So I feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re positioned well, but not secure in our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better or else, yes, we will get disintermediated \u2013 perhaps by another intermediary, but we always have to stay on our toes and do things better.","I think that\u2019s it, operator, where we can end the call, because I know we\u2019re beyond our hour. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Specifically thank our clients for their support and the faith they put in us, and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. Thank you very much.","Operator","Again that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank everyone for your participation. Please have a great day."],"14267":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Please go ahead.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Glena. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is, Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.","Our first quarter represents a great start to the year. Before I get into the results, I would like to say how delighted we are to have completed the JLT acquisition earlier this month. There is tremendous energy and optimism around the benefits this combination brings to clients, colleagues and shareholders. We welcomed over 10,000 talented colleagues into the organization, providing us with more capabilities to serve clients. And this is the real power in this combination.","The need for specialist advice has never been greater as clients deal with the increasing size, complexity and range of business challenges. Simply put, we are stronger together. We are the leading global professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. On a combined basis, we place over $100 billion of P&C insurance and reinsurance premiums globally. Our reach extends to more than 130 countries. We are number one in insurance brokerage, including specialty lines, the number one health and benefits broker.","We are neck and neck in reinsurance. We are number one HR consulting firm. And we have leading specialist industry capabilities in management consulting. Size and scale are increasingly important but size isn\u2019t everything. Quality and capability are what really matter to clients and on that score, we are second to none. Creating what is Marsh & McLennan today was no small undertaking. It took decades of steady execution and courageous decisions. I am deeply grateful to the prior leaders of Marsh & McLennan for their significant contributions to our current success. We will continue to build and improve the reach and capabilities of MMC.","With regard to JLT, we worked tirelessly to obtain all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the deal on April 1. At the beginning of March, we announced the agreement to divest JLT\u2019s aerospace business. And during the first quarter, we secured $6.5 billion in debt financing at favorable rates, including our first ever euro bond issuance. With the benefit of the in-house expertise of Oliver Wyman, we moved quickly to establish transition teams to plan the integration. We made several leadership announcements across the organization and named JLT executives to nearly all of our executive committees. We selected leaders without regards which organization they came from.","JLT brings us an influx of talent with complementary capabilities giving us more depth in almost every part of the organization. We are co-locating our colleagues to enhance opportunities for collaboration. We are working hard to keep our organization focused and are encouraged by the strong finish to 2018 at both JLT and Marsh & McLennan and our strong start to 2019. Growth requires hard work and execution. And I have every confidence we will be stronger and better position than either firm was before. To be clear, we are not promising perfection. There will be bumps and we could see an impact on growth during the integration process. That\u2019s fine. We will sort it out and press forward as we work to build something special.","In addition to JLT, we will continue to execute our broader growth strategies. We will not let up on innovating, pressing it to new growth areas and investing. For example, we continue to expand in middle market commercial insurance through Marsh & McLennan Agency. When we first announced the JLT acquisition, we committed to continue to provide MMA financial possibility to pursue further acquisitions. We have stayed true to this plan. Since the start of the year, MMA acquired Bouchard Insurance and Lovitt & Touche, both top 100 U.S. insurance brokers. The combination of strong organic growth and having high-quality agencies through acquisitions has resulted in MMA\u2019s annualized revenues exceeding $1.5 billion, and we still see significant runway.","There is meaningful growth potential in the small commercial segment across our businesses, where we are focused on digital initiatives. We see opportunities to help simplify the client experience and add value at every turn in this large and fragmented market. Major challenges facing society also present opportunities to grow and help our clients. In many markets, actual losses from cyber, flood and other natural perils far exceed insurance coverage. Filling this gap is a growth opportunity for us that also serves a greater good.","Retirement security is a major challenge for society as much of the world is falling short of what today\u2019s aging population will need. Mercer is a leader in this space where actuarial investment in FinTech specialties meet. In Health, the need for advice in the face of healthcare complexities is significant and we are well positioned given the strength of our capabilities across Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman.","Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance pricing trend. Overall pricing is modestly higher. The Marsh global insurance market index, so an increase of 3% in the first quarter, up from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1% in the first quarter of 2018. Global property lines continue to see price increases. Casualty price declines have slowed while professional lines pricing increased approximately 6% in the quarter.","Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpenter\u2019s Global Property Catastrophe Rate on Line index increased 1% for the January 1, 2019, renewals. More recently, the pricing data coming out of the April 1 renewals, which are primarily focused on Japan, were up for loss impacted programs. We are starting to see upward rate pressure in the market in certain pockets and geographies although capital remains abundant.","Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. Marsh & McLennan had a strong start to the year. We generated consolidated underlying revenue growth across both Risk & Insurance Services and Consulting. Consolidated revenue was $4.1 billion, up 2% or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 10% to $1.52.","In Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 3%. Underlying revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying growth of 5% or more in RIS. Marsh had another strong quarter with underlying growth of 5%. Guy Carpenter\u2019s underlying growth was impressive at 6%, given the tough comparable of 7% growth in first quarter 2018. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points versus a year ago.","In Consulting, first quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, in line with the year-ago. Underlying revenue was up 2% for the quarter driven by strong underlying growth at Oliver Wyman of 7%, partially offset by Mercer which was flat. Nevertheless, we had strong growth in Consulting adjusted operating income of 18%, and saw a 270 basis points of adjusted margin expansion.","Martine took over as CEO of Mercer March 1. While Mercer is underlying growth was soft in the quarter, Martine has a firm grasp on the business, and we are confident in Mercer\u2019s long-term growth outlook. Based on the slow start, full your underlying revenue growth in Mercer could be muted. However, full year earnings growth will benefit from Mercer\u2019s recent restructuring initiatives.","In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. For 2019, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS, although with respect to underlying revenue, we are mindful of potential impact from the integration of JLT.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan. Good morning. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year. Overall revenue was up 2%, 4% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 3%, while adjusted operating income was up 11% to a record $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 26.2% and included strong margin expansion in both RIS and Consulting. GAAP EPS rose 4% to $1.40 and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.52.","Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, up 3% compared with the year ago and 5% on an underlying basis. This is a continuation of the strong growth we generated in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 33.6%.","And Marsh revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and helped by strong new business. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of strong growth with 5% underlying revenue growth. In International, underlying growth was also 5%, with EMEA up 3%, Asia Pacific up 8% and Latin America up 11%.","Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $663 million, up 6% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America. Guy Carpenter\u2019s strong first quarter performance builds on the outstanding results delivered in 2018. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, which is flat versus a year ago and up 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth at Oliver Wyman offset by softness at Mercer. Adjusted operating income grew 18% to $291 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 18%.","Mercer\u2019s revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion, with flat underlying revenue growth due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison to the 5% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter of last year. Results this quarter reflected growth in health and career offset by a decline in wealth. Wealth underlying revenue fell 3% in the quarter, reflecting a mid-single digit decline in defined benefits, partially offset by continued growth in investment management.","Our assets under delegated management continue to grow and were approximately $265 billion at the end of the quarter. In early 2017, we established the wealth business by bringing together our retirement and investments businesses. This changed the line more closely with how we serve clients and was designed to simplify the organization and reduce layers.","At this point, given the evolution of these businesses, we will now report wealth is one combined business. Health underlying revenue increased 3% in the quarter despite a tough comparison of 7% growth in the first quarter of last year and Career grew 2%. Mercer incurred $11 million of charges in the quarter related to its ongoing restructuring program, which we expect to be completed by the end of the second quarter. The benefits of the program contributed to the strong earnings growth and margin expansion in Consulting.","As Dan mentioned, we expect this program will benefit full year earnings in Consulting, although we will see moderation in margin expansion from the level in the first quarter as we move through the balance of the year.","Oliver Wyman had a great start to the year, with first quarter revenue of $518 million representing growth of 7% on an underlying basis. Results were strong across most of the portfolio. As you know, we closed our acquisition of JLT on April 1. Due to strict rules regarding sharing of competitively sensitive information prior to closing, we are in the process of reviewing the details of JLT\u2019s 2019 budget, converting their results to U.S. GAAP by quarter and developing a firmer perspective on some of our modeling assumptions.","As a result, we expect to update the elements of our previous guidance on our next call. We continue to expect the JLT acquisition to be modestly dilutive to adjusted GAAP EPS in year one, breakeven in year two, and accretive in year three. In order to help the investment community better assess the combined business, before our next earnings call, we plan to provide JLT\u2019s 2018 results by quarter under U.S. GAAP.","In addition, we will file the SEC required pro forma disclosures showing 2018 pro forma earnings for the combined company. As contemplated in our financing plans, we raised a total of $6.5 billion of senior notes across eight tranches of debt at various maturities. In addition to $5.25 billion of U.S. debt, we also completed our first euro bond offering in March, raising an additional \u20ac1.1 billion. We began incurring interest expense and generating interest income on proceeds from this debt as of January 15. In our GAAP income statement includes $47 million of interest expense and $25 million of interest income as a result.","As we indicated on our last call, both of these items were excluded from adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Following the close of the transaction, we now expect second quarter interest expense will be about $114 million (17:11). We also incurred $7 million of interest expense in the quarter, representing the amortization of fees related to our bridge facility. This $7 million is included in interest expense and our GAAP income statement.","In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $29 million relating to the hedge instruments we put in place as part of the transaction. All of these costs associated with the JLT acquisition have been treated as noteworthy item. With the transaction now completed, our hedge position and our bridge facility have been settled and closed.","Turning to investment income, on a GAAP basis, investment income was $5 million or $1 million on an adjusted basis in the quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was $0.03 per share headwind to EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in each of the second and third quarters.","Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 22.6% compared to 23.5% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete item, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. We expect that most of the tax benefit from equity awards will be recognized in the first quarter of each year, which is when most of our equity awards bet. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. Based on the current environment, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding discrete items in any impact from JLT.","In the first quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard. This result in a minimal impact operating income, but did result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet of $1.9 billion, which is largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets.","In the first quarter, we did not repurchase any stock in line with our guidance that we would not repurchase stock ahead of the close of the JLT acquisition. However, we continue to anticipate repurchasing enough stock in 2019 to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13 billion or $12.3 billion, excluding commercial paper. This compares with $5.8 billion at the end of 2018. Total debt includes the $6.5 billion of debt issued in the first quarter to fund the acquisition of JLT. At closing, JLT had $1 billion of debt outstanding, $450 million of which was repaid shortly after closing, leaving $550 million of JLT debt that is still outstanding. We will likely refinance this debt over the course of the next several months. Post closing, our total debt, excluding commercial paper stood at $12.8 billion.","Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 with 300 million of senior notes will mature. At this point, our expectation is that we will retire the September notes with cash on hand in line with our plan deleveraging over the next couple of years. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 billion.","Note that the cash proceeds from our debt issuance in the quarter were held in escrow as reflected on our balance sheet as opposed to on the cash line. Uses of cash in the first quarter included $210 million for dividend and $288 million for acquisition. While deleveraging will be a priority over the next couple of years, we provided for the flexibility to continue to pursue selective acquisition and MMA will be the primary focus given the significant success of this strategy over the last decade.","For the full year 2019, we continue to expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. As noted on our last call, starting this quarter, we have changed our calculation of adjusted operating margins to exclude transaction amortization, so investors can get a better sense of core margin performance following the JLT acquisitions. This change had no meaningful impact on the increase in margin in Q1 compared with a year ago.","Our press release includes supplemental information that recast our margins in 2017 and 2018 by quarter to exclude transaction amortization. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our strong start to the year.","And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Mark. Glena, we\u2019re ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, Dan, a couple of times in your remarks you alluded to the fact that there could be an impact on growth during the integration of JLT. I mean, I know you guys are only a month into the deal. But could you just expand some comments on that? What part of your businesses you expect \u2013 you could see some headwinds? And then kind of as a supplement to that question, are you guys going to include JLT within the acquired revenue line or is it going to be part of organic revenue starting in the second quarter?","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Elyse. And okay, so MMC\u2019s underlying growth has been in a range of 3% to 5% for the past decade. And I certainly anticipate that sort of range or better over time. So I\u2019m not \u2013 any comment I\u2019d make is really in the near-term as opposed to thinking about mid-term or long-term. And the reality is we expect some near-term choppiness as we go through the integration process.","I mean, some revenue loss, this synergy was modeled in our base case, not that we\u2019re not going to fight every fight, but we are realistic about what big integrations mean in people businesses and so let\u2019s see how this will play out. There will be some short-term noise, but that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s noise. The combination of Marsh & McLennan and JLT will prove to be spectacular.","The greatest collection of talent and capabilities in our space, improved geographic positioning, higher capacity to invest in the future, things like data and analytics and digital. And our data and analytics flywheel, that I\u2019ve talked about before. I mean, the combination will give us more clients. More clients will create more data. More data will allow us to use analytics to create additional insight and gain more clients. And so in that way, it\u2019s self-perpetuating, so very positive overall. In terms of your follow-up, Mark, it\u2019s \u2013 why don\u2019t you handle that?","So we see on smaller acquisitions, our convention has been to exclude them from underlying growth for the first year after a deal. But we won\u2019t do that in this case. So we will \u2013 when we report underlying growth going forward, it will be combined MMC and JLT.","Mark McGivney","Yes, we want to get to, just so we\u2019re clear. We don\u2019t want to be sitting here internally months from now talking about, well, how did Marsh & McLennan do in Asia in the month of July and then how did JLT do. There is no JLT. There is no Marsh & McLennan. There is the combined organization and we are one. So we want to look at the new organization and the results on a combined basis.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And I agree that will be more helpful to analyze. My second question on the margin side, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was anything one-off within Consulting, your other operating expenses declined significantly in the quarter relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. I wasn\u2019t sure, if there was something that was driving that or if it\u2019s just less investments and \u2013 like you said in some of your prepared remarks you\u2019re repaying on some of the benefits from the restructuring actions there?","Dan Glaser","That\u2019s exactly right. I mean as we\u2019ve said before, I wouldn\u2019t look at any one quarter as indicative in terms of the margin trajectory. And I would also reiterate that for us, margin expansion is an outcome of the way we run the business, almost always revenue growth exceeds expense growth and we\u2019re more focused on top line revenue and earnings growth than we are on margin expansion, but we expect continued margin expansion, because of the way we run the business. And 2019, in our view, will be our 12th straight year of margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Phillips","Hi, good morning. Thanks everybody. Just I want to dive in deeper a little bit more on the Oliver Wyman, nice momentum in Oliver Wyman in the quarter. It\u2019s kind of continued in the last couple of quarters. And so maybe you can kind of the talk about where you\u2019re seeing that and the expectations going forward?","Dan Glaser","Sure, sure. And as we\u2019ve said before Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time, will probably be our highest growth operating company but with more volatility because of the nature of the business and the lack of recurring revenue, but Scott you want to add to the comments?","Scott McDonald","Sure, Mike. Despite I think what are pretty regular warnings of doom and gloom from economists in the press these days. We see little evidence across almost all sectors and regions. But there is a slowdown in the initiatives, businesses are pursuing, most of the businesses we work with are still focused heavily on growth or transformation or technology.","And Dan has talked about I think many times on this call just how complex the world is becoming. It\u2019s more global, more political, more technology change, more challenges with data and analytics, more challenges around the workforce and all this bodes pretty well for high-end strategy consulting. So our predictions have remained the same. We continue to target mid to high-single digit revenue growth over time. I think you will have seen over the last few years, our revenue can be pretty volatile, but over any long period. That\u2019s what we think we can achieve.","Dan Glaser","Anything else, Mike?","Michael Phillips","No, thank you very much. I appreciate that, that\u2019s good.","Dan Glaser","Okay. Thank you. Ryan?","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks, good morning, guys. First question, just sort of a $0.03 per share headwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, what was the impact had on the margin?","Dan Glaser","So Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","Ryan, it was a modest benefit to margins, but not anything terribly significant. The biggest driver of margin expansion was operating performance in the quarter.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then I actually wanted to ask about the whole Medicare for all theme. And I\u2019m curious in markets where the impact that that might have on the Healthcare Consulting business. So maybe you could just give us some perspective in countries where there are single-payer systems, Canada, UK. I guess are you able to have a presence in the Healthcare Consulting, when you have that type of system?","Dan Glaser","I\u2019ll take that question broadly and then I\u2019ll hand over to Martine to talk a little bit about what we see in markets like Canada and the UK, et cetera. But I\u2019ll just start by saying, Health is a great business for us. In fact, it\u2019s our largest line of business. We\u2019ve got almost $2.5 billion of revenue and almost half of that is in the United States. And clearly, Medicare for all is a hot topic. But what that means and what form that could conceivably take really depends on who is talking about it.","And for consultants and trusted advisers, uncertainty generally creates opportunities as we \u2013 as clients seek advice. And so we don\u2019t see this in the short-term is any significant headwind or a negative. I mean just to level set for a second, over 180 million Americans receive healthcare benefits through employer-sponsored plans. And generally speaking, those plans are highly subsidized by employers.","So more than of the half of the U.S. population is being served by their employers in that way and significant changes if any. And I would stress if any, would be unlikely until 2021, 2022 and that\u2019s really unclear whether there would be any kind of significant change. But in the mean time, we\u2019re certainly going to work diligently to improve availability and affordability to our clients. And for us, I would stress that it\u2019s a global business. And we\u2019re successful globally. So Martine, you want to add something to that?","Martine Ferland","Yes, certainly. Thank you. And first let me say, I\u2019m excited to taking the helm, and I\u2019m delighted to be here for the first time with you all. So from a Health perspective and you were referring to UK and U.S. in your question, actually I\u2019m very familiar with those being Canadian and having lived in the UK last 8 years. We have striving health businesses in these two countries and in many countries around the world.","Even with universal systems, what we see is there is a need for employer-provided plans where there is supplementary plans, supplementary cover that is being provided. We\u2019re also very active in providing wellness advice, health advise and helping employers manage the cost curve in every country and also helping individuals manage the healthcare system. These are just very often complex system. People in need them at the moment that matters for them, really need help. So as the health becomes more consumerized, we see also opportunities for us to help employees, retirees, individuals manage cost and access the best care they can at the best price.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Martine. Next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. First question is from regarding the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, they published their final report this past February, but the wholesale insurance marketplace. I\u2019m curious if the closure of that study changes Marsh\u2019s game plans at all or maybe the study had changed the game plan prior? Maybe perhaps speed up moving into more of those types of facilities and any color there would be great?","Dan Glaser","Sure. I mean, overall, we were pleased with the outcome only really as a result of any time that there is a level of uncertainty, because a big review is taking place. We\u2019re watching it closely. Our view was, it was largely business as usual. Market functioning it\u2019s very competitive. There is new capital formation. There is great client outcomes. But I\u2019ll hand over to John to talk about if it influences Marsh\u2019s strategy at all. John?","John Doyle","Thanks, Dan. No, I don\u2019t see it changing our strategy going forward at all. We have governance in place and guidelines and philosophies statements around how we get paid, how much we get paid and what that fee income is related to? As Dan said, we were pleased with the outcome. Facilities that we use to place business into in the London market makeup a small, really fraction of our overall placement strategy around the world.","Although, we do think, and it\u2019s a way for us to drive value to our clients ultimately. And as we come together with JLT, we\u2019re learning a little bit more about their approach to it, philosophy to it as well. So we see an opportunity for greater use of facilities, but it won\u2019t be a dominant part of our placement strategy.","Dan Glaser","Anything else Mike?","Mike Zaremski","Yes. One-off last follow-up, Dan to your comments about P&C pricing moving a little bit north. You mentioned abundant capital, curious if you guys have any theories on what\u2019s causing the move up in rates? I guess the million dollar question for all of investors is it \u2013 is where the rates are just moving up as a result of the increase in loss inflation or is something else going on in terms of the competitive dynamics?","Dan Glaser","Pricing is always a lagging indicator and it is geared toward losses. Ultimately, it\u2019s really a supply and demand market, the higher the losses that underwriters suffer, the more that they actually underwrite, reduce their exposures and that creates some level of supply crunch, which raises rating levels and pricing. And so we\u2019re not in a soft market and we\u2019re not in a hard market. We\u2019re sort of in the shoulder market, but I\u2019ll hand off to the experts both John and Peter to add a little bit more color to the pricing commentary. So John, what you see on the primary side?","John Doyle","Okay. So as Dan noted earlier, prices going to average is up 3% in the quarter versus 2% in the fourth quarter. In most regions around the world, prices were up 1% to 2%. So as Dan just said it\u2019s not what I would define as a hard market by any stretch. Australia is probably the one exception where prices are up on average in the low-double digit range across various lines of business.","Financial lines pricing was up about 6% in the first quarter, just shy of 6%, probably P&L pricing really driving that. And to your question about, why there has been an increase in frequency and severity around securities clients, right. That\u2019s persisted over the last several years. I mean, so underwriters are obviously responding to that and trying to push price.","Property pricing largely driven by cat exposed risks and we all know about the cat loss environment for the last couple of years, up about 5% in the quarter. Casualty remains pretty risk, pretty mixed \u2013 excuse me, as you know as longer-tail. Work comp pricing remains down about 5% on average in the U.S. General liability down about 2%, but excess liability pricing is moving up a bit, that was up 3% in the quarter. Auto pricing up 5% in the quarter.","What I would say is that the market is more challenging for buyers than it\u2019s been in sometime. It\u2019s definitely different than it was three months ago and six months ago. Again, having said that, the average isn\u2019t moving all that much. As Dan said, capital remains abundant and while capacity remains stable, the risk appetite for some underwriters is changing. So, at times we\u2019re seeing lower limits being offered, higher attachment points.","In some cases, underwriters are exiting certain classes of business. Now, again, on average we\u2019re getting things done for our clients in the right way. And I don\u2019t see a broad based hard market in front of us. Over time, some risk classes will get mixed price for various reasons. And so I think we\u2019ll see some micro cycles where correction will happen over a short period of time.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, John. So turning to the reinsurance side for some commentary on that, Peter, you want to tell us what\u2019s happening on the reinsurance market?","Peter Hearn","Sure, Dan. Mike, a lot of the comments that John said pertain to reinsurance as well. I mean, you had $200 billion of losses in 2017 and 2018. And they continue to grow. I think that many of those losses were quantitatively different from those as investors expected. And they included deterioration in the 2017 loss and the loss creep we\u2019ve seen from urban in particular. Losses for un-modeled or under-modeled peril such as wildfire and then losses from human causes such as the assignment of benefits issue that we\u2019ve seen in Florida.","So to John\u2019s point, the market has been orderly at 1.1 and 4.1. Yes, we\u2019ve seen increases with loss impacted business, whether it would be Japanese wind. We\u2019re now starting to see the assets of the Florida renewals, where there has been loss impacted layers, there has been rate increase. But I would say overall the market is transitioning. It\u2019s not a hard market. By definition, most people use for hard, but it is certainly transitioning on those lines of business where there have been losses.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Peter. Next question, please?","Operator","Next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Great, thank you. I had two quick questions for Martine. First, obviously the restructuring plan going on and Dan mentioned, the potential for distraction associated with the JLT merger. Is the restructuring itself responsible for some of the weakness in Mercer in the first quarter?","Dan Glaser","Yes. So let me talk about that a little bit and then I\u2019ll hand over to Martine. I mean I think in general and as you\u2019ve seen in the past throughout our company, there are periodic periods where we believe as a very large global organization. We have to look at our structure. We have to approach it in a way that always been looking to simplify delayer, focus more on the client, because large companies by their very nature, grow infrastructure and other accouterments.","So that in my view was more of a normal course type of restructuring effort and whether that has an impact on short-term growth is unlikely. I think the reality is Mercer grew 5% in the first quarter of last year. They had some tough comps and that\u2019s probably at the heart of it. I made the muted comments in my script, because frankly, Martine just got the job. And the last thing I want is for her and her key team to be focused on the next few quarters and delivering some \u2013 what I want them to do is, look at the business, drains out like any new executive team, come up with plans on how to drive sustainable profitable growth over multiple years and that\u2019s really the task at hand.","And in terms of that JLT, I wouldn\u2019t call it a distraction in any way in terms of integration, whether that\u2019s about RIS or Mercer. But I think it\u2019s more of a recognition that there some areas of the business that might have some revenue breakage and the employee benefit side is probably not one of them. But Martine, do you have anything to add? I think you give much room.","Martine Ferland","Thanks for the question. Well, as Dan just said, I think the elm about two months ago, very excited about it. I think Mercer has unmatched global platform and capabilities. The areas in which we play Health, Wealth, Career, really they address topical issues for society, for enterprises, clients, individuals. Our expertise is very strong, recognized. Our brand is strong and we are leaders in all the countries where we operate.","What we offer is needed and value for our client. So I do see growth. And many of our business areas are growing well. As Dan and Mark said, we had tough comparables in some places, Health in particular, some are delegated solution and really strong market a quarter \u2013 a year ago. We had strong \u2013 we had good market movement this quarter, but lesser than a quarter ago. Really it\u2019s \u2013 as you all know, the actuarial defined benefit business within Wealth is one area that has a structural decline.","And that said, I believe we can perform better in this area than we have done recently and I come from this business. I have previous experience in it and we\u2019re in the process of implementing changes there in terms of roles, incentives, technology. That will enhance retention and also we invigorate ourselves on the market. And as you know, we are very strong on the delegated solution side. It is absolutely interlinked with our pension business. We have closed $265 billion of assets under management at the end of the quarter by far the leading market leader in that space.","Meyer Shields","Thanks.","Dan Glaser","So Meyer, I think \u2013 any follow-up, I\u2019ll count your restructuring in JLT distractions. It was stated together that as one query. Do you have anything else?","Meyer Shields","Just a quick one. In terms of whether there is any useful rule of thumb relating the Mercer restructuring expenses and the anticipated annualized savings?","Dan Glaser","No, I mean, ultimately, a lot of the savings will drop to the bottom line. But we\u2019re always looking to invest in the business and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And so \u2013 and there is no rule of thumb associated with that. Next question, please?","Operator","The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. Mike, my questions were really answered. But I guess, maybe I\u2019ll just dig or throw one more out on JLT. I mean, Dan, it seems to me that other large acquisitions in this space. This synergy\u2019s tend to come from people leaving deciding for whatever reason that, they don\u2019t want to continue to be part of the big team and choose to do something else. Is that mostly what we\u2019re talking about here?","Dan Glaser","To me, that is a part of it, but a small part of it. I mean we are getting over 10,000 talented colleagues. Yes, sure, we\u2019ll lose some, who decided they\u2019d rather work in a different environment. But in my view, we were the employer of choice in our industry and our leadership team. Part of their principal job is to create a culture and environment that attracts and retains the top talented people in our space.","And so, I have no doubt that we have a collection of individuals that will form teams that are very solid in the marketplace and really on a top talent basis. I think, when I look over any kind of stretch of time, I imagine, when you think about a mid to long-term time horizon, anything we\u2019re talking about potential revenue breakage will largely be meaningless in the overall scheme of things. But it could create a headwind in the short term.","I\u2019ll just give you a couple of easy examples. You might have a retail client within Marsh and JLT, where the clients themselves always had two brokers and they want two brokers, okay. Some clients choose to do that. Other clients want [indiscernible] (46:03) strength of a very strategic organization to organization relationship. But if you add a client that wants two brokers. And one of those brokers is JLT and one of those brokers is Marsh right now.","Well, then there\u2019s going to be some activity there or you might have some wholesale business where U.S. third-party broker that used JLT in London, because they didn\u2019t view JLT as a competitor in the U.S. All of a sudden, they view Marsh as a competitor in the U.S. And so maybe they\u2019ll have some challenge about whether, okay, how are you guys going into one the business to where you can still service our needs.","And we\u2019re going to do the best we can, best endeavors to try to do that and keep things separate and run businesses in a way that we always put our clients\u2019 interests first even when that client might actually be a competitor in some other part of our organization. But what we are really, like I said, ultimately, I think that this will be a meaningless number when we look over the course of a few years. Ultimately, clients choose best talent. The best talent and capabilities will win, not about any what badges or name is on the building.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning. I know, you guys have shied away from giving any targets around cost saves and the like, but just given the meaningful impact that we\u2019re seeing here in Consulting on the margin front. Is there anything you could say about the cost saves from the current restructuring?","Dan Glaser","I mean, the overall restructuring is in that $70 million to maybe $80 million level. Most of its already been done. So what you\u2019re seeing is some roll forward on that it would be natural have more savings early after restructuring than later because the level of investments are not having \u2013 not necessarily occurring simultaneously with the restructuring. But ultimately, this was not a large restructuring in the overall scheme of things. There will be savings, which dropped to the bottom-line as we\u2019ve always done that, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about that. What I would overall focus on is the fact that our margin has expanded dramatically over many years. I mean, the company\u2019s margin is up something like 700 bps in the last five years. And so, we have continual margin expansion as we run the business properly. And we see margin expansion in 2019 as we said in the script.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I switch over to RIS, I think, MMA now accounts for about a third of your U.S. revenues in Marsh. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s going to get diluted a little bit through JLT, but is there a number or a portion of the business that you would like it to be or that you would not wanted to cross?","Dan Glaser","It is a couple of things. One JLT is quite, quite modest in the U.S., so it won\u2019t have a real overall impact on the various percentages. And no, we want MMA to continue to grow. We think that there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still a very fragmented space. The largest part of the market when you look at the vast middle market, however you define it \u2013 it\u2019s a terrific sweet spot for the company. We\u2019ve built what we believe is the finest national platform in the middle market and we will continue to look at that.","There is no end in sight and we certainly wouldn\u2019t create a constraint on MMA in order to create some percentage between large accounts and national brokerage and MMA. It\u2019s like we will go wherever the market will bear. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, I mean, Marsh, John and his team and Peter before that have done a very good job of maintaining our position and growing our position in the large accounts space, while growing faster in the vast middle market in many countries around the world. And so Marsh is becoming much more like a pyramid as opposed to top-heavy with regard to just in risk management.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","I wanted to touch base a little bit more on the potential [indiscernible] (51:09) with JLT. Is it fair to say that the places that you\u2019re most likely see some organic growth slow are the places with the most combined market share? And if maybe you could \u2013 if that\u2019s the case maybe to sort of give some thoughts on where we might see it or not see it if it all things go well?","Dan Glaser","Yes, I think you guys are all sort of overstating it as an issue. As I just said, over the course of any kind of mid-term basis, we\u2019re looking at something, which would be a meaningless type of number. And we modeled it within our deal costs anyway. I mean, I think the obvious thing would be if you look at RIS, that\u2019s where most of JLT exist, that\u2019s where most of the integration takes place. But, we\u2019re not looking at big numbers. And by the way, we did model any revenue synergy into this deal.","And we\u2019ve expressed before the notion that we absolutely expect some revenue synergy as JLT clients, existing JLT clients have access to things like Oliver Wyman, Mercer Investment, Mercer Career, some of the digital capabilities and data and analytic capabilities within Marsh. But we\u2019re a conservative company the deal model, stood on its own. And so therefore, we didn\u2019t model that, but we\u2019ve been surprised positively about many of the things we have seen within JLT. And I start with the idea that the quality of the people is very high.","And our view about how we go forward is we\u2019re a people business and the greatest degree of high quality, talented, creative, diligent, hardworking people working as a team creates more value for our clients and ultimately for our colleagues in career path and our shareholders as well. There is a few things that we\u2019ve been happy about that we did not expect. As an example, Mercer has extensive operations in India, which support their business.","This is much less so in Marsh and Guy Carpenter, but interestingly, JLT actually has a pretty high degree of integration in their operating model in India. And that gives us mid-term possibilities for Marsh and Guy Carpenter that would be easier to capture than if we just did this on our own in. Other things that we\u2019ve seen, while obviously compensation is always different in organizations and then people business is vitally important.","The methodology in how we look at compensation and the team-based way of how we look at client service and profitability is very similar between the two organizations. And that contrasts with certain other organizations that put the individual producer and individual production at the top of the compensation model. In our company, that\u2019s different, and I\u2019m happy to say the JLT was as well.","So I would just say, there\u2019s tremendous optimism and energy within Marsh & McLennan right now to welcome our JLT colleagues. And we will deliver not we \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re not promising perfection. These are big companies coming together, but any noise will be short-term. And we certainly expect over time that 3% to 5% growth or higher will be delivered. We just wanted to be upfront and say, but don\u2019t forget, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. So next question, please?","Paul Newsome","That makes sense. Obviously, you have a great track record with making acquisitions. It also similarly, as you go through the process. Are there any pieces that might end up being divested or slowdown or they also affect the revenue as we look forward with go buy company?","Dan Glaser","I mean, when we \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say, like I said, there is no JLT anymore. What there is a combined organization that is coming together and forming a new organization. We are the \u2013 we\u2019re the largest start up in the world. And so, when I look at it, we always look at parts of our business. Our entire business, in a way of saying, where the low growth, low-margin business is. And we always create challenge as to whether those businesses are required or not?","And we would do that across our entire organization, the broader organization, which is both Marsh & McLennan and legacy JLT. Put them all together, and we create quadrants, as you know, high-growth, high-margin; high growth, low-margin; low margin, low growth and et cetera. And so ultimately, that\u2019s a continual process and you\u2019ve seen us over the years. Every once in a while, divest in asset almost in all ways, it\u2019s in that low growth or low margin category and you\u2019ll see us continue to do that as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes, maybe questions for Mark, some modeling questions. Mark, you\u2019ve given us the interest expense for the 2Q. Can you talk about the corresponding investment income from the proceeds that you should expect to see?","Mark McGivney","And Jay, as I said, we had $25 million of interest income on the cash that was sitting around in escrow. But at this point, it\u2019s all been deployed. And so going forward, I\u2019d expect minimal amount of interest income, sort of what we\u2019ve seen in the past and whatever corporate cash flow.","Jay Cohen","Go it. That makes sense. Quarterly amortization expense post deal, can you give us a sense of that?","Mark McGivney","As I said in my script, Jay, that along with a number of other elements of our model, we\u2019re really in the process of updating our perspective on. So, at the last guidance we\u2019ve given is $180 million on a post-tax basis. And for now, that\u2019s where the number stands. But as we \u2013 between now and the second quarter that you\u2019ll see some pro forma information come out as required. On June 11, we\u2019ll be required to file a pro forma that will have after JLT for 2018 with pro forma adjustments. Purchase accounting will be one of them. So, you\u2019ll get a little bit more information when that\u2019s filed. And then on our next call, I\u2019d expect to update those elements of guidance that we\u2019ve given in the past.","Operator","The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Styblo","Hi, there. Good morning, thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just come back to JLT for a second and I appreciate the prudently cautious comments about just bumps and being forward about that. I guess, I\u2019m more curious about how the customer experience is and engagement has been about opportunities? You\u2019ve touched on a couple of them to start to go down that path. But I would like to hear more about what the customer response has been and some of the opportunities that you guys would have to cross-sell and provide more services as a deeper share of wallet within the customer base?","Dan Glaser","Sure. I mean, it\u2019s a great question and actually, the initial client response, since the deal announcement has been incredibly positive and RIMS is coming up. So, why don\u2019t I ask John to go into that a little bit more detail? So, what do you seeing John, what are you hearing?","John Doyle","Sure. Initial feedback has been quite positive. I have spoken myself to a couple of dozen clients in the last couple of weeks, including a few yesterday and the feedback has been quite positive. Many of these relationships, of course, overlap. So, wasn\u2019t a first time introduction for me with a number of clients that I engaged with. Obviously, we were competitors just three weeks ago, right. So, we\u2019re still just starting out how the value proposition will change, but there are real opportunities for cross-sell, right.","JLT in a lot of ways, although a big company operated like a specialty boutique and we had a kind of a broader view of the client relationship. And so those relationships are often fitting together quite nicely. And as Dan pointed out earlier, I want to make sure their teams will be in place, right. The people have they\u2019ve hired in the past will continue to serve them.","So, I was in London on day one and for the first week and Lucy Clarke, who comes from JLT and now leads Marsh\u2019s Specialty Operations, Marsh JLT Specialty. She and I worked together most of the week. We are also really quite encouraged literally on the first day. We had teams in the market together, working on accounts. There is nothing more than those kind of experience to accelerate kind of the socialization that needs to happen between the two teams.","And as Dan said, RIMS starts on Sunday. And so the masses will descend upon Boston. We will bring a bit of an army ourselves. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to spend some time with our colleagues, new colleagues from JLT. But we have 1,500 client meetings scheduled from Monday through the end of day, Wednesday. And it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to get feedback, and so we\u2019ve got some systematic ways of doing that, and then, of course, more informal feedback. But at the end of next week, we\u2019ll have a much more data on it but we\u2019re off to a good start.","David Styblo","Great. Thanks. And then real quick, I knew these are smaller businesses within Marsh geographically, but Latin America, Asia Pacific, the organic growth was really quite strong. And I think, Latin America, the 11% was for some in double-digits for a couple of years. So curious to hear about anything particular, driving that broad-based products or services? So\u2026","Dan Glaser","I mean, Latin America \u2013 I mean within Marsh, Latin America has been the highest growth region in the aggregate for the last decade. But, John, anything in particular?","John Doyle","Look, I was pleased with the start to the year for sure. I do think we\u2019re getting a little bit of lift from pricing to be clear. But some of the leadership changes that we\u2019ve made are taking hold in some parts of the world. So I\u2019ve been pleased with that. As you all know, and we underway a simplification effort a year ago and moved some talent to faster growing areas. I think that\u2019s contributing to increased growth. But I\u2019m pleased with our \u2013 the execution of our strategy and the focus on client segmentation. New business is improving and most of the world, last three is improving.","Some of the faster growing kind of specialties if you will, are transaction risks, cyber very good quarter in aviation. Our Energy business has performed well in the first quarter, as did our Credit Specialties. Our MGA business is also growing nicely as well. So, it\u2019s pretty broad-based, good start to the year. Latin America and Asia, I do expect over time to grow faster than the rest of Marsh.","Operator","That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to your host, Mr. Glaser, for any additional or closing remarks.","Dan Glaser","No. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining the call this morning.

They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Glaser","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","Before I turn to the quarter, I would like to take a moment to recognize our Vice Chairman, David Nadler, who will retire at year-end after 13 years with the company. David leaves MMC with my personal appreciation, as well as that of our executive committee and the Board of Directors for a job exceedingly well done. Marsh & McLennan's performance in the third quarter included 15% growth in adjusted operating income. This result underscores our journey to be an elite company, as we successfully execute our 4-pillar strategy to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.","As a global growth company, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow revenue and earnings. We have consistently delivered underlying revenue growth. We have also steadily expanded adjusted EPS in recent years, including increases of 13% in 2011, 16% last year and 17% through 9 months of this year. At the same time, we continued to execute on our other 3 pillars by maintaining low capital requirements, intelligently managing the risk profile of the firm and generating strong free cash flow. Our results reflect significant investment in our businesses that we absorb on an ongoing basis. In addition, an increasing portion of our growing cash flow is available for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. We believe a balanced approach to deployment of capital will contribute to long-term earnings growth and maximize total return to shareholders.","Now let's look at our third quarter results in more detail. Both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting delivered double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and excellent margin improvement, as they have each quarter this year. Our consolidated adjusted margin rose 150 basis points to 14.1%. Underlying revenue growth again exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses as it has for 21 of the past 22 quarters. We expect to continue to achieve operating leverage while making investments across our businesses.","The operational improvements we have embedded over the last several years have led to higher colleague productivity, efficiencies in our global real estate footprint and reduce professional liability costs. At the same time, we are continuously investing in areas that will support future growth and drive additional efficiencies. We are investing in growth markets and new offerings, building sales capacity, expanding distribution, creating innovative analytical platforms and capabilities, and making strategic hires and acquisitions. We are confident we have a powerful engine to generate revenue and earnings growth in both segments.","Risk and Insurance Services produced another quarter of excellent profitability, as adjusted operating income rose 14%. Underlying revenue increased 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. The adjusted margin expanded to 15.2%, the segment's highest third quarter margin in a decade, and an increase of 130 basis points from the prior year. At Marsh, revenue was $1.2 billion, as all major geographic regions contributed to 3% underlying revenue growth. The international division expanded 6%, led by growth of 15% in Latin America, 7% in Asia Pacific; and 3% in EMEA. In the U.S.\/Canada division, underlying growth was 1%. Revenue growth was driven by client revenue retention supported by strong new business, which totaled over $250 million in the third quarter.","Guy Carpenter continued its solid financial performance and long-term trend of underlying revenue growth. Revenue was $262 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. This is an impressive performance in an environment where Guy Carpenter is experiencing higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions. Growth was broad-based across North America, International, Global Specialties and U.K. facultative, led by double-digit gains in Continental Europe, Canada and Global Marine.","Consulting's performance in the third quarter was outstanding. Revenue was $1.4 billion, up 4% on an underlying basis, the segment's best performance in the last 5 quarters. Adjusted underlying expense growth of 1% reflects the benefit of prior actions and expense control. This produced adjusted operating income of $231 million, an increase of 13%, marking the segment's third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And the segment's margin increased 150 basis points to 16%, Consulting's highest third quarter margin in its history. This marked improvement has occurred while navigating challenging macroeconomic conditions.","Mercer had an excellent third quarter. Revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Health and Investments continued to lead the way with increases of 5% and 8%, respectively. Retirement had an increase in project work, resulting in 2% growth and talent grew 2% as well. Growth was achieved across all geographic regions. In October, Mercer announced that it had signed up 52 employers onto its private U.S. health care exchanges. Since that time, Mercer has signed up an additional 4 employers, and now has 34 that will offer benefits through Mercer Marketplace, its active exchange, and 22 employers that are offering Mercer's Medicare retiree exchange solution. In total, Mercer's exchanges will cover over 220,000 employees, retirees and family members for 2014.","Oliver Wyman returned to positive revenue growth in the third quarter, with underlying revenue increasing 2% to $365 million. The revenue increase was driven by Financial Services, Oliver Wyman's largest practice, which represents approximately 40% of its revenue. Oliver Wyman's sequential improvement in revenue performance was broad-based across major regions, including North America and Europe. In summary, MMC's performance in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of the year was excellent. Our results show that the company's strong earnings momentum continues. We will host an Investor Day in New York on March 11, where we will provide more insight into MMC's operational and financial strategies. We hope you will join us.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, MMC's revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 15%. The consolidated margin increased 150 basis points to 14.1%, and adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.46. These results are on top of 18% growth in adjusted EPS in the third quarter of last year. With investment income was $0.01 higher than anticipated in the quarter, this was more than offset by a higher tax rate that negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.02. For the 9 months of this year, MMC's revenue was $9.1 billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 15%, with the margin increasing 190 basis points from 15.8% to 17.7%. GAAP EPS for the 9 months increased 14% to $1.89, and adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.91.","Investment income. The recognition of carried interest from Trident III led to investment income of $14 million this quarter. While it is difficult to forecast, we anticipate approximately $10 million of investment income in the fourth quarter.","Taxes. The corporate tax rate in the U.K. was reduced in July. While this will benefit us going forward, the value of our U.K. deferred tax asset was reduced, which is the main reason for the increase in this quarter's tax rate to 32.4%. MMC's tax rate for the first 9 months of this year was 30.2%, which is more representative of our underlying tax rate.","Interest expense in the third quarter decreased from $44 million last year to $40 million this quarter. When we funded our $250 million debt maturity in February from available cash, we indicated that we planned to enter the debt markets later in the year. In September, the company issued $500 million of debt, comprised of $250 million of 5-year senior notes and $250 million of 10-year maturities. Additionally, proceeds from the new debt issuance were used in October to redeem $250 million of our existing senior notes due in 2015. This new funding allowed us to refinance at lower interest rates, while at the same time extending the average maturity of our debt portfolio. The cost of the early extinguishment of the 2015 debt was $24 million or $0.03 per share. This expense will be included in both GAAP and adjusted fourth quarter results.","Cash utilization. Cash on the balance sheet at quarter end was $2.2 billion. The increase from last quarter reflects strong operating cash flows in the $500 million debt financing. Our cash utilization in the third quarter included $150 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares of stock, marking 6 consecutive quarters of share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have purchased 10 million shares of our stock for $400 million. Also, in the quarter, approximately $140 million of cash was used for dividends, which reflects the recent 9% dividend increase and $20 million related to acquisitions.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Mike. So operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In Risk and Insurance Services, U.S. and Canadian organic growth has been trending very, very low single digits on an organic basis. Could you talk to the market dynamics and outlook, and also how Marsh & McLennan agencies middle markets strategy has been impacting the segment's growth rate?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, so first of all, I'll just say that in the RIS segment, we have Marsh and we have Guy Carpenter and your question is really pertaining more to Marsh than it is to the entire segment. So I'll hand off to Peter who can give us a little bit more detail.","Peter Zaffino","Sure. Thanks, Dan. First, I'd like to highlight some of the real strong performance we had in the quarter and year-to-date. Latin America, as Dan said in his opening, we had 15% growth. Asia-Pac was 7%, and despite economic headwinds in EMEA, we had 3%. We recognize in the U.S. \/Canada division, we have had modest growth at 1% in the quarter. It's a seasonably low quarter for Marsh and the U.S.\/Canada division. We have had in the quarter some negative variability from some of the programs we have within the segment, and we would expect growth to be higher in the future than what we have reported in this particular quarter. Some of the fundamentals are quite strong. New business through the 9 months is up year-over-year, and as we mentioned, we had record new business when we look at the comparables year-over-year. So overall, again, it's been a little bit lumpy. If you look at our comparisons to competitors, you have to remember we don't report Latin America in our U.S.\/Canada division, and also employee Health & Benefits for the core brokerage in the U.S. is reported in Mercer. To answer the second part of your question on agency, they've had good organic growth, where we would expect them to be in line with their comparables in the middle market in the U.S. So they've been growing organically, have been making a contribution, and exactly where we thought they would be on the revenue and margins at this point in time.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Lastly, this is probably for Mike Bischoff. Is there any kind of sensitivity or you can give us around the pension-related expenses and cash contributions? If the assumptions are changed at the end of the year. I believe since the plans are open, there could be a material impact to the expense level, as well, running to the income statement?","Daniel S. Glaser","So Mike, you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Sure, I'd be happy to. You're absolutely right on 2 categories. First, pension expense and second, contributions into our pension plans. Let me deal with the pension expense first to put it into context. The main driver of the change in pension expense on a GAAP basis year-over-year is interest rates, and over the last 5 years, we've seen interest rates go down dramatically. I should say, this is more in the immediate -- intermediate and longer-term rates, where the discount rate is calculated. And we've absorbed through our P&L approximately $250 million of additional pension expense during that time period. So your question is very appropriate. What's the outlook going forward? Well, the irony of pension expense accounting is that you do a measurement at year-end, and so you don't take the average where interest rates or the discount rate would be over the course of the year. You do it at year-end. And for that reason, it's very hard to anticipate where pension expense would be. I would just point you to -- say that there's 2 interest rates that you should track. One is obviously the U.S. rate and the other one is the U.K. rate because we have a very large U.K. pension plan. The second part of your question deals with cash contributions into the plan, and you can see that we're on track, including the pre-funding of some of our obligations to fund about $650 million into our global pension plans this year. We would think that, that would be markedly reduced for 2 reasons. At this point in time, we do not plan to make any discretionary contributions into our global plans. And as we've indicated, $250 million of the funding for this year was dedicated to pre-funding of future obligations in the U.K. that would cover the '14, '15 and '16 time period.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the -- your healthcare exchange initiative. Really 2 questions around that. First, your large competitor has -- is guiding to a lot of seasonality in their Consulting segment, and partially due to the way the revenues flow in, revenues and costs flow due to health care exchanges. Do you have similar seasonality as they do? Therefore, it might be a big fourth quarter. And where will we see that, which division should we be modeling that in? And then the other question in healthcare exchange just could you compare and contrast your initiative relative to others in the marketplace?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, Julio, so the first question first.","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay, thank you. I'm going to start off by saying that we have a large business, of course, in total Mercer. That's right over $4 billion of revenue. Any movement in the exchange in 1 quarter or the other would have some impact, but not significant impact in the overall results in Mercer. It's a very large organization. But specific to your question about whether or not you're going to see a fourth quarter bump or not in revenue, so let me just say, simply, no. Even though a lot of the work and a fair amount of work is done in all of our H&B business that we work on in the third and fourth quarter of this year, the actual exchange contracts themselves incept on January 1, in this case, 2014. So the revenue will be earned throughout the 2014 year, and so there will be little -- in fact, there'll be no revenue in fourth quarter 2013, and then there will be an appropriate revenue throughout the year in 2014.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Julio. And the second question was, if I paraphrase, Greg, how would you compare Mercer Marketplace with the competitive offerings in the market?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, great question, Greg. Because I know with everything that's going on, sometimes, it's difficult to see whether there's distinctive factors. I want to really focus on a couple of things that I think has been out there, and first, allow me to level-set a bit. Mercer Marketplace supports both a fully-insured and self-insured funding model and funding models. Mercer Marketplace also offers a panel of carriers for either structure. Mercer Marketplace offers core medical. And in addition to core medical, also voluntary and ancillary products. Of our clients on the platform to date, roughly about 75% of them have chosen fully-insured model, and the remainder have chosen self-insured model. This is a reflection of the more middle market representation in our book. Generally, mid-market companies have fully-insured, and they've chosen to continue that fully-insured under the Mercer Marketplace model. Our larger clients, again, determined that they are most advantaged by staying in self-funded options, and they continue to use those under Mercer Marketplace. Even in an active exchange, no matter what the model, each employer group is rated separately. So in our exchange, we ensure that competitive pricing is taking place for each one of our clients, as we work with carriers to design programs for them and their group. A self-insurance funding model tends to be lower cost overall for larger groups due to savings on risks, changes, as well as premium taxes. And so these advantages don't necessarily go away when you go on to the exchange. So overall, when you combine what we believe is a very large availability of choice, we have up to -- we have 30 carriers, as an example on our particular exchange. Some of them, of course, work just in the core medical space, and some of them in the ancillary and voluntary space. When you compare all those advantages, we think we're very well-positioned as we look at the competition and the future.","Daniel S. Glaser","Perfect. Thank you, Julio.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, thanks, and then one quick follow-up on that is just can you remind us what the economic model is around the exchanges, both from a revenues and a margins perspective?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay. Thank you, Dan. We have had a -- there's a lot of discussion going on and speculation about how big this market is going to be in time, and certainly, and how quickly it's going to develop. I'm not going to get too crazy about the speculation of that. I'll leave that for others. But based on what we have seen in our own book and through this sales season, I think we know that there's significant interest by our clients. I think the concept is obviously something that generates that interest, and the trend is certainly here to stay. That said, it's anyone's guess as to how big this also will become, and no matter what the outcome, we think we're very well-positioned. So as Dan mentioned earlier, we're very pleased with the clients that we've sold in the first year so far. And we're pleased with the pipeline that's developing, not only for '15, but also for mid-year '14 and we've been pretty consistent in saying that while we expect these changes to be a contributor to revenue and earnings, in the medium term, in the short-term, the impact will be modest.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Julio.","Operator","And we'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about the turnaround in the organic at Oliver Wyman? And how much of that might be Europe coming back? And then, just to stay with Julio, you're driving a really strong margin improvement, and we know you're spending money on investment initiatives and we're all fixated on the health care exchanges, but just wondering if you might be able to comment on some of the other initiatives you have in place that may be pretty specifically directed towards margin improvement.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, Larry. So let's start with John on the turnaround. I'm not sure we would use that same word in terms of a full turnaround, but we're happy to see positive growth return. And I only say that because when we think about turnaround, we generally think about profitability as well, and John and his team have done a really superb job of fighting through some struggles on the top line and maintained it on the bottom line. And so from that standpoint, it's hats off to John and his team. But John, you want to talk about the return to growth?","John P. Drzik","Sure. As Dan said, Larry, in his opening comments, our performance has been steadily improving through the year, and business has actually been strengthening in all of our major regions. So to your question, Europe has contributed to that growth, and we do see improved conditions in Europe and expect that to be sustained. North America has also contributed, as has our international market. So overall, we're seeing growth -- or improvement across-the-board, and we expect that improvement to sustain. So looking ahead, based on the pipeline we're seeing, we expect to sustain positive revenue growth in Q4, and have good momentum going into 2014 in all of our major markets.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, and then turning to Julio, and I'd just start by saying that we've been really pleased with both of our segments. I mean, with Marsh and Guy Carpenter, we started margin improvements several years ago, and that has created its own momentum and has sustained itself and we have every expectation that the Consulting segment, albeit in its second year of significant margin improvement, will sustain margin improvements in the future. So Julio, do you want to take that?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks, Dan. The third quarter represented another quarter of solid performance for Mercer. We continue to execute on our growth initiatives. We're delivering against our strategic priorities, and we're generating increasing earnings and margins just as we have, really, over the last several quarters. Our revenue, as you know, is up 4%. The areas that we continue to see improvement in are the ones we're investing in. Of course, the health area and investment business overall. We're also seeing some good growth coming from our growth markets initiatives to expand internationally, and we're seeing the beginning fruits of that labor. And we're also seeing good margin improvement as well in those same areas, where we traditionally had done some investments in different ways in the past. We continue to carefully manage expenses as you can imagine. I mean, you go in an organization, you have opportunity to really take a bird's eye view on what's going on. You make assessments where you need to disinvest. And at the same time, you make assessments where you need to invest more, and we've been doing that and calibrating that over the last couple of years, and that's also going to be a discipline that we'll continue to do as time goes on. As far as specific areas of investment that we're making in our business, we continue to be very focused on ensuring that when we think about investments, we think about them in short, medium and long-term ways, and so exchanges obviously is one thing that we've talked about, and I'm sure we'll continue to talk about as time goes on. But talent, client -- talent and client-facing technology is very important to us, as well, and we've put a lot of breadth of improvement, especially in an area that's like data and surveys. We see good margins there, and obviously, we're investing in those areas to bring that to be a larger portion of our portfolio. We're taking legacy systems, and we're obviously retiring some, investing in new generation systems. Salesforce.com was a big investment for us. We think that we'll be able to enhance our broadening of client relationships through having a good CRM tool, which also will continue to improve margin, and hopefully top line overtime. Retirement Studio, which is an enabling vehicle for us to be able to do some additional actuarial work for retirement. Strategic hires, expansion and geographic growth areas like emerging markets that I mentioned earlier. And platforms to expand our delegated Investment Solutions, and you see that continuing to move in the right direction, profitably. So all these things, I think, are things that we continue to look at, continue to invest. We continue to calibrate appropriately, again, disinvestment and investment. We'll continue to do that and run the company in a disciplined manner.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, thanks Julio. Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Of the roughly $2.2 billion of free cash in the balance sheet, can you give us the mix of international versus U.S. cash currently? And then could you also talk about the outlook for getting cash from the international subs to the U.S. as we move through the rest of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Mike, do you want to handle that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, the $2.2 million of cash at the end of the quarter -- I'm sorry, $2.2 billion. Yes, where'd that extra money go, anyway? Of that $2.2 billion, there's actually $2,174,000,000. $250 million of it, as I indicated, was paid down in October for funding the 2015 debt. And so when you look at our remaining cash, what we typically do during this time period is you see it grow because we're working towards the first quarter with regard to bonus payments. So it's very typical for us to have higher levels of cash, not only at the end of the third quarter, but at the end of the fourth quarter. But going to the heart of your question, you'll also notice on a year-over-year basis, our cash is down when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, not sequentially. And the reason for that is that we are and have had a strategy to bring back in a tax-efficient manner our international cash for U.S. funding purposes, and those funding purposes are acquisitions in the U.S., dividends and share repurchase. And so we're the process of moving more of our international funds, even as I'm speaking now, into the U.S. for share repurchase and for looking at bonus payments in the first quarter. So overall, we're working down our excess cash. We're bringing it into the U.S. in a tax-efficient manner, and it's a very good story with regard to returning capital to shareholders.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you give the mix of how much is U.S. now or is it more appropriate to wait till fourth quarter, given you're in the process?","J. Michael Bischoff","I think it's probably more appropriate to wait. I have right in front of me the Treasury sheet that gives me on a daily basis what our mix is between the U.S. and global. So I have that information, but I think it's probably just best to wait.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Mike. Any other questions, Dan?","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just also just on your -- just with regard to Guy Carpenter, I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for growth going forward. I mean, you've had continued nice organic there. And I think your competitors have as well, maybe better than I would've thought, given some potential headwinds there that we're seeing on pricing. But maybe if you could talk about the outlook, and then also maybe other revenue opportunities that could emerge because of some of the changes in the marketplace.","Daniel S. Glaser","Alex, you want to take that?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Sure. As you say, we've been on a good run of organic growth for quite a while. And despite, I would say, headwinds during all that, and I think that stands to the quality of our people, the quality of our offering and the fact that we have good discipline. We've widened our net. We've segmented our client base, and we're coming up with discreet value propositions for each of those areas. I would point out a mutual segment that's very successful and E&S segment that we've just opened up. We've invested in Accident and Health, which we see as a growth area, of course, and areas such as agriculture, as well as overseas. So we think that there is room to grow. We think that we're the employer of choice. We've got the best people. We're investing, and we will continue to grow, we believe.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I can follow up on that question. Does the -- I guess, recent merger of 2 slightly smaller reinsurance brokerages, does that change the competitive dynamics in your reinsurance markets?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Clearly there's a change because something just happened, but we'll continue to -- we respect our competitors, but we're focused on our clients and focused on growing, focused on having the best people investing right, and that's what we'll continue to do. So we're not blind, we keep our eyes open, but we move ahead.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough.","Daniel S. Glaser","And we generally -- Meyer, we generally think competition is a good thing. Competition keeps us on our toes, and makes sure that we're always innovating and creating additional value for clients. And so we have a lot of respect for our competitors, but we believe our proposition is unique.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, and the results have certainly been there. One quick numbers question, can we get a sense of how many shares are typically issued over the course of the year for compensation?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, absolutely. And I would just say in a broader sense, we're now in passing our sixth consecutive quarter of share repurchase. When we were talking with you, I guess about 18 months ago, we committed to meaningful share repurchase, and we're following through on that. And our view is that, as we go forward, our uses of cash would very much remain continuing to invest in our business, although that's usually not lumpy because we've been doing it on a pretty consistent basis, our dividend, and growing our dividend year-by-year as we grow our earnings on some basis, maybe not fully aligned with that, but certainly in the ballpark, acquisitions, and then share repurchase. And so Mike, do you want to take the specific question about the actual share count?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, Dan. I'd be happy to do that. But I think it probably is good to put into context what you were describing, which is really what's the aggregate level of shares outstanding that we had with regard to our stock options and the restricted stock unit, so essentially, what was the overhang. And if you go back on -- and look at as recently as the end of '09. When you combine those 2, the overhang that we were dealing with or looking at was 69 million shares that would, we think, eventually come into the market, and we would deal with that. And if you look at it at the end of the third quarter, which is more specific to your question, the number is 31 million shares. So over the course of the last few years, we've really been absorbing and catching up with this overhang. So when we look at it, not only for this year -- and I'll give you a little bit of a projection on it, but going forward, we really feel that, in aggregate, we have to make up -- we're looking at about 15 million of shares issuance this year for the restricted stock. But predominantly a stock option exercise, dealing with, for many years, we had very limited exercise of stock options. But now, it's fairly high. And we think that for this year, it will be about 10 million. So specifically answering. Your question, the 14 million or 15 million shares that we're going to be dealing with this year. About 10 million of it is just with regard to stock options that are being exercised, and the rest is just restricted stock, so really not a large number. And then we think after this year, and like I said, a little bit of projection, but we think after this year, the heavy overhang is behind us, and the uses or requirements for restricted stock and option exercise will decline significantly. So now just completing what Dan was saying, we think we're through the most of the catch-up. And if we continue meaningful share repurchase, which is our intent, we'll flatten out the share count, and perhaps even turn it downward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First one for Mike, just to isolate the one-time items in 4Q. So the Trident -- if I could just get those numbers again, the Trident benefit in 4Q, the new run rate interest expense, and the impact of redeeming the, debt because my sense is that will all flow through adjusted, correct?","Daniel S. Glaser","That's correct. Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Okay. Dealing with interest expense, the run rate, I think, for the last couple of quarters is about $40 million. We did just issue debt. The average cost of that debt, though, is 3.3%. And so the calculation, when you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, won't be much of an increase. With regard to the extinguishment of the debt, it's already occurred. We know it's $24 million. That's $0.03. The third part of your question, I think, dealt with investment income, predominantly, the carried interest with regard to Trident III, and we do not do the calculations. That calculation is done by the private equity firm that manages and oversees Trident III. It's a fairly complex calculation that they have to go through every one of the investments that they have because it has to do with regard to the partner interest, and what part of that partner interest no longer can be clawed back. And so I do have some sympathy for them when they're going through the calculation and giving us that information, trying to give it to us on a timely fashion. That's why we say it's very difficult to forecast because it has to do with the harvesting of their profits and how it impacts the specific part of the carried interest that could not be clawed back. So that's a long way of saying, we don't know for sure, but we would put it in the $10 million range for the fourth quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. And then my separate broader question is on the opportunity for Risk and Insurance Services margin expansion. That spread between organic revenue growth and underlying expense growth seems to be widening over the past 8 quarters, and perhaps, you can just give us a bit more perspective on what you're doing on the expense front to keep that low.","J. Michael Bischoff","Sure, sure. And so let's just start by saying that if you look at our expenses in total, our comp and benefit expenses have actually been rising over the last several years. And it's not just salary inflation, which runs about 30% a year for the people who are still at the company, but it's also pension expense, as we've mentioned before, and some other areas of benefits. And so the comp and ben line has been rising. So the real story is the great job that we've been doing on all other expenses. And so from that standpoint, it's everything from premises to T&E, to meetings, and there's literally about 30 categories of expense that we've been pretty focused on and relentless to make sure that everything is on a need-to-have basis, as opposed to a nice-to-have basis. And so a big part of the story, frankly, over the last 4 years that you have seen in the RIS segment and that which you have begun to see in the Consulting segment is the ability during a year to do things which will benefit you in future years and so -- and to wear that within your P&L. And so what you're seeing here is not a 1-year story. It's basically a couple of years that roll forward as a benefit and in with the things that we're doing with respect to comp and ben. Now let me just say, our expectation is for some pretty reasonable growth in margin in the coming couple of years. The way we look at it, though, we actually put margin third on our hit parade. We look at growth in revenues first, both organic and through acquisition, then we look at earnings. And our focus really is driving earnings, and in particular, EPS. And we've said, you stick with us over a 10-year period, we'll give you a CAGR of EPS of 13% or so. We've been delivering on that basis. We're not saying it's every year or every quarter, but we certainly think we will do it over the long term. And the last point is margin, and we seek margin expansion and we'll always have margin expansion if we continue to have expense growth less than revenue growth. Now to be sure, as the margin gets higher and higher in either segment, the ability to deliver margin expansion of significant levels reduces because the air that you would need between expense growth and revenue growth gets wider and wider as the margin goes up. And it would be bad leadership and management if we look at those businesses and said, \"Now that the margin is terrific, we want more air. So we want you to be investing less in day-to-day in those businesses.\" And so we're very open. We don't see it in front of us now, but certainly, over the years, we would expect that if these margins keep improving that at some point in time, we won't be as focused on double-digit operating income growth. We would remain very focused on double-digit EPS growth, but it would shift slightly. But we don't see that in front of us today.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So essentially, you're saying next couple of years, pretty clear go wide path to continued margin improvement and EPS growth and -- I'm sorry, earnings growth in the RIS segment?","Daniel S. Glaser","Correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Two quick questions. One, just back on the exchanges, just quickly, of the new clients that you've got, I guess, 56, I'm just curious, how many of those were actually existing benefits administration clients for Mercer? So what's the actual new business that you're actually getting versus just putting somebody in the exchange?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, and so here's one thing, Brian. As you recall, if you go back a quarter or 2, we were saying that any time you're in a business where it has some real innovation going forward, the focus is on existing clients, explaining to current clients what the alternatives are. And so I'll hand over to Julio to give you the details. But certainly, our belief was very much that this was going to be in the first iterations existing clients, as opposed to new clients. But Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Right. Thanks, Dan. Of H&B clients, of the 34 clients in the active space, one of them is actually new to Mercer. And again, this was expected. As Dan mentioned, we expected to have a lot of discussions with our clients as we were trying to design responses to different changes that were happening in the marketplace, under ACA and others. We have a really solid pipeline, though, I want to say again, for both mid-year enrollments and also 2015. And I also want to make sure it's very clear that on our existing clients, we still see opportunity for expanding because we have a great breadth of additional ancillary and voluntary products that we traditionally have not worked with clients on. So that gives us a potential for opportunity on the upside. And of course, in most cases, we are brokering additional lines of coverage as we expand these relationships and adding new services such as a full plan administration that we may or may not have had in the past. And also we get the opportunity, as I said, for ancillary products which tend to have higher commission in core medical. So there are a lot of opportunity even with our current clients to expand our relationship with them and broaden it even further.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So there is going to be a revenue pickup from putting existing clients in exchanges because of the other services, plus it's just a different revenue model? Is that correct?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, I mean, we expect it. Time will tell because we're just launching now, right? So 2014 clients are launching as we speak. They're obviously coming in and looking at what we have to offer, and time will tell in the near future as to how the revenue -- average revenue per client actually behaves.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then one quick one on the reinsurance, if I may. Wonder if you could chat a little bit about the supply of kind of alternative capital right now coming in for one more renewals? And is there still reasonable amount of demand from pension funds and stuff to actually invest in this business, and then what impact do you think it has on 1, 1?","Daniel S. Glaser","Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Clearly, it's the big subject in the reinsurance world, and we also made around $45 billion and growing of interest looking to be deployed, because not that much is -- that amount is deployed. I think the insurance companies are taking a balanced look. They're going to use traditional reinsurance. They're going to use this new capital. The effect on us, clearly, it's a bit of a headwind. But on the other hand, we're seeing that because of the way we have our revenues, either from just a fee structure or capped commission, the effect is being mitigated somewhat. And we're actually doing a lot of cap -- new cap business, so we're doing -- I think our revenues are probably double what they were last year, year-to-date. So it's providing a lot of options to our clients and where there are options there's need for advice, and that's what we're doing. We're making sure we understand the appetite of the suppliers of capital and the appetite or demand of those who need it, and try to match that. So we're kind of excited about this so we recognize that it just makes life more interesting.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. How much of your business right now is fees or cap commissions so you're not going to see the impact?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Well, I would rather not give you that indication right now...","Daniel S. Glaser","It's actually a relatively small fee.","J. Michael Bischoff","It's a relatively small amount, given...","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, it's a relatively small fee.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I had a question on the exchange. I'm trying to understand, I think, if someone moves to an exchange, I'm guessing part of the reason they do that is to kind of divorce themselves from rising health care costs. Can you talk about why a company would move to an exchange to self-insured? Is it really from a -- just to outsource the management of the benefits or is there another aspect to that decision that I'm missing?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio, you want to take that question?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, there are several reasons why companies considers exchanges. Certainly, to give their employees the opportunity to have a wider range of choice as to how they design their specific benefits in relation to their needs, and that's a big impetus. Second impetus, of course, is, yes, clients are looking for the opportunity to understand how they might be able to structure programs for better cost control as time goes on and time goes into the future. Now that's usually as a result of moving from a defined benefit type of a health offer to defined contribution. But we actually saw many of our clients convert, at least for this time period, and stay under the defined benefit piece, which means that they would continue to be potentially vulnerable to increases in medical inflation. But over time, I'm sure they'll make decisions as to how best to be able to do that, might move to a defined contribution. Thirdly, yes, there are a lot of requirements under the new ACA for administration and considerable cost associated with that. And they want to make sure that they can put themselves in a position where they can rely on someone who already has the experience to do that, and hopefully, more efficiently and more effectively, for them and their employees. And then there are several other reasons as well as each individual circumstance is evaluated, and we design programs to address those needs.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, one of the benefits in bending the cost curve is not about necessarily clients moving from defined benefit to defined contribution, but it's using the services of Mercer to bend the cost curve through wellness programs and comparison shopping between different medical providers, and so it's a very broad subject. I would just remind everyone that the health benefit is one of the core benefits that people look at when they're deciding which company to give their services and time to, and so companies will have to be relatively cautious because there is a war for talent out there, and it would take a very brave company, and perhaps, even to go very quickly to say, \"We want to get out of health care. Because if your competitors don't, then you may be opening yourself up to some talent vulnerability.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess, I mean, on that point, I mean, how do you weigh the decision, Dan, to move or not move to an exchange with your employee base? And I'm guessing you -- to the extent you did, you probably already know which exchange you would go with.","Daniel S. Glaser","I pretty much have that one down, and Julio is sitting right next to me on my right. So I mean, for us, is that -- when we first looked at Mercer Marketplace, the first thing that we said was we want in because it created greater flexibility to individual colleagues to make choices which are relevant to them and their family sizes and a whole slew of other things, and so to me, it was very flexible. What we didn't want to do was crowd-out existing Mercer clients, and put ourselves in front of the queue, so to speak. And so just to be clear, the Marsh & McLennan Companies will be joining Mercer Marketplace at the point in time the Mercer Marketplace says, we'll make the catch without impacting any other clients.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. The first is, on the Consulting business, do you see a natural limit to the margins you've given? That business has gone up because, clearly, you need to be investing in the business as you do. So is there a natural limit to the margin ceiling, if you will? And then secondly just to make sure I got the numbers, when you talked about the number of lives in Mercer Marketplace, I think you said 220,000. Is that in both the active and retiree exchanges?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, so let me take the first question first. The 220,000 lives are both in the active and the retiree space and count both existing employees and their families. That takes care of that one. In terms of the Consulting segment's margin overall, I would say there's no natural cap to those businesses, but recognize that the Consulting segment is different than RIS. It has lower levels of aggregated recurring revenue streams and so it's more about the mechanics of the business in terms of how the P&L is arrived at. And so, naturally, there's higher levels of acquisition cost because you always have to find the next project, the next account in some parts of the business. Now both Julio and John are working to find ways of making the business stickier with clients and more recurring. But I would doubt that it would ever be at the levels of RIS, where, in insurance, people just say \"Hey, I'd buy an insurance policy year-after-year, and it's not as cyclical and I don't really care about what economic conditions are. I might change my deductible or terms and conditions, but I'm buying that policy.\" It's different on the Consulting side. So while there's no natural cap, I think the idea that there's 2 elements to it: one, the P&L construction is less recurring revenue; and two, on the people side, the Consulting segment, in general, has some of our most highly-educated, world-renowned experts and you pay for those experts. And so from that standpoint, there's a bit of a constraint just on the comp and ben side.","Operator","So we'll take our final question from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Have a final wrap up here on the healthcare exchange and margin accretion. I guess, Julio, when you talked about the breakdown of sort of the 25% that are still using a self-insured model within the exchange, within the Mercer Marketplace, if I was to think of a current Mercer benefit client that's a self-insured client, a larger, corporate America client, and was going to transition to a Mercer Marketplace exchange on a -- continue on a self-insured basis, is there any margin change in that client? Outside of ancillary, I understand all that different, but just on the core service, is there a margin difference?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","It's difficult to discount the impact ancillary and voluntary products will have on that margin and relationship we have with our client. So if you were to take an apples-to-apples client situation, it usually ends up when they go on the actual marketplace, there's a potential, even under self-insured, for that margin to hopefully improve, to be quite honest with you. Because over time, they will continue to sell, like I said, via voluntary and ancillary. We made a conscious decision when we went in, unlike potentially others, that we wanted to have that as a very important platform, a part of the platform. And so it's difficult to distinguish it when we made it as part of our major strategy and part -- a strong part of the platform and value proposition for all of our clients that come onto Mercer Marketplace.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I think I understand. The other question I have, quickly, is on the brokerage side of the business, on the risk side and the Marsh Agency business. I guess, when I look at the revenue base, and I know recently you said at a presentation that Marsh Agency's got about $450 million of revenue. I guess I would have thought the risk business would have had more growth? And so I guess my question would be is, on the traditional Marsh client, pre-agency, what is the retention both on number of clients and fee basis been on that piece of the business?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Let me just start by speaking broadly, and then I'll hand it over to Peter. First of all, the RIS segment, we're very happy with the level of growth and the consistency over many quarters. We've grown organically 14 quarters in a row within RIS. And when we look at the overall Marsh business in total, there's been a good mixture of high levels of revenue retention, as well as new business. So we look at that business, and we're pretty comfortable. As Peter was mentioning earlier, and we have an ethos in this shop of not calling out individual small items and trying to make everything an exception, we wear our results. But to give Peter a little bit of a pat, what he was alluding to earlier was that there was a little bit of timing in the U.S. and Canada. And there was one particular program within the agency, which is nonrecurring, which used to be a pretty big program, and a government agency decided not to buy it. And so that has had an impact in a quarter where we don't expect to be a recurring impact, and -- but I'll hand over to Peter and see if he wants to elaborate at all.","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Dan. That's very thorough, and what I would add is that I want to emphasize, again, that the fundamentals of the core business are strong. New business is strong. Client retention is very strong, and so overall, the performance, looking at it in 1 quarter, you can draw conclusions. But I try to take a look at it over a longer period of time, and I'm very confident that we're going to perform very well. And just a reminder that the 6 different businesses that we report in that segment, so it's U.S.\/Canada, Marsh & McLennan Agency, we have an MGA, we have a STARS, which is our RMS platform technology business, we have programs, we have private clients. So when you take that all in the mix, they don't all move in the same direction in a particular quarter. So again, Dan had highlighted some of the anomalies. There are a few more, but overall, I can assure you that the fundamentals are quite strong.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, I mean, I wasn't talking about this quarter, and I probably should have said that, per se. It's just sort of, if I look at Marsh, ex-Guy Carpenter, ex-fiduciary, look at Marsh revenue, I've got about $5.5 billion for 2013 and just over $5.2 billion in 2011. And I look over that time period and go, okay, we've got $400 million of agency revenue build-up, and go, I would have thought that $5.2 million plus $400 million plus some organic growth from the traditional business would have had overall Marsh level, just higher, just on a theoretical basis, not like this quarter and anything like that.","Daniel S. Glaser","That's fair enough, and I just want to draw it to a close. But I would, as a reminder, just go back into the notes and have a look at the consumer business, which we pulled out of Marsh, the couple hundred million dollars, and now it's counted within Mercer. And so in those numbers that you were citing, you would have to restate it for that consumer business.","Okay. So thanks, Charles, and thank you, everybody. I'm very happy everybody was able to join us on the call this morning. I would also like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results. So have a good day, everybody.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"14296":["Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.

Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Shelan, and good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. I'm very pleased to welcome our new CFO, Mark McGivney. In addition to having a very strong operational background, Mark becomes the first MMC Chief Financial Officer to have served both Marsh and Mercer as CFO. Welcome, Mark.","Joining me on the call today are the operating company CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","It is difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I recently return from Davos, where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our clients face the challenges of the day, many of which revolve around risk, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the Annual Global Risk Report produced by the World Economic Forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This Report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes as well as government entities and individuals.","Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risks to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the UN, 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions in commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks given the limited tools at their disposal in a near zero interest rate environment.","Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to post modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates. And the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remains strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape.","Our fundamentals are rock solid. We are stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance and we deliver on our commitments.","So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and consulting segments. In terms of our full-year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and consulting segments.","This expansion was balanced across the segments, with Risk and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3% and Consulting up 80 basis points to 17.3%. On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05, while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010 and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this six-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share.","Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring at many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting appetite at several companies, as well as a willingness at some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility.","These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients, since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC, such as volatile markets could result in a flight to quality, as clients seek brokers who have a depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more toward their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call; it is just as likely to create more competition in the short term. And high quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged, healthy, competitive market, with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service.","Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Starting with organic revenue growth, one of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer term, owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, under-penetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices.","While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and UK continued to perform relatively well. These two countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue.","On a consolidated basis over the last six years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low-single digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world, with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low-single digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the effects of rate reductions.","Turning to margins, we have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings.","We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter, we would not expect this to occur for a full year. So, as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year.","Moving to EPS growth, 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth, or 14.5% on a constant currency basis. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target.","Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitments to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits, and we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint.","I also want to spend a few moments on our investment philosophy. We believe in balance and, in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress.","Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increase in our head count of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last eight years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion.","Acquisitions are a core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies; we develop relationships over time. We see chemistry and a cultural fit. And we invest in growth, not just geographically, but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion.","Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions. And, in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitments seriously and we have delivered year after year.","In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, as we continued to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well-positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance.","Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion.","GAAP EPS rose 31% including a $37 million pre-tax gain from Mercer's sale of a U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain has been excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company.","On an adjusted basis, for the quarter EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4% with solid growth at all four operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1%, with both segments contributing.","GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high-single digit guidance we provided throughout the year. For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3% and the margin increased to 21.1%. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion and the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade.","Adjusted operating margins in RIS have improved every year since 2007. Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion, with underlying growth of 4% driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. The U.S. Canada division grew 3% led by Marsh & McLennan Agency. In the international division, underlying revenue grew 5% with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the UK, 4% growth in Asia-Pacific and 13% in Latin America.","In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of UK-based Jelf Group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S. Canada and International division. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry.","Moving to Consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase.","For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5% and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Consulting has built a track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points.","Mercer's revenue was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all three of Mercer's major geographies: North America, EuroPac and Growth Markets. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%, and talent, up 7%. Investments rose 2% and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well.","In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including CPSG Partners, a provider of Workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer successfully completed the sale of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years, investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not meet our return requirements or are not core to its business. For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%, health up 6% and talent up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last five years.","Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by Financial Services, Lippincott and the Actuarial business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014.","As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you regarding our Global Retirement Plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015 we recognized a non-recurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. Post-65 Retiree Medical Plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in annual retiring (23:05) expense we faced last year due to declines in global interest rates. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only through 2016, but beyond.","As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan, where it was divided into two separate plans. This structure better positions the company to take advantage of derisking opportunity. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plan. This lowers annual pension expense. As a result of these changes coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016, or $0.04 per share.","Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should essentially offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense.","As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impact will be felt in the first half of the year.","Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7% and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016.","Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility with few near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last three years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pulled forward a portion of the share repurchases we had plans for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned, this year we expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchase, acquisitions and dividends.","In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends, a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital included our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash.","Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. For the year, uses of cash included $632 million per dividend, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments and $1.4 billion for share repurchases.","For the fourth quarter, we deployed $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisitions and $75 million for share repurchases. Cash on our balance sheet at year-end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. Once again, in 2015 we delivered on our capital return commitments. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividends per share by over 11%.","With that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. We'll have our first question from Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I think my first question is for Dan. I think it's in response to talking about 2016 growth. And I think you said that hoping it approaches the longer term target, which is 13%. And I guess thinking about the currency headwind, that would seem to imply a pretty decent chunk of either organic growth or margin expansion. So I'm just wondering if there's anything outside of those segments \u2013 I don't know if it's tax rate or anything along those lines that might help push that growth rate upward.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Actually, in terms of how we get close to our long-term target and, in fact, achieve it over the long term, there's no magic formula. It has basically, obviously, top-line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow the top line, the easier it is to expand margins. Although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth.","We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for 2016, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range and we will have margin expansion in both segments and, therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So, there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera.","The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong and we would expect that to continue in 2016.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up for Mark. I think, first of all, how should we think about just cash pension contributions next year relative to this year? And then also just wanted to make sure I understand these changes correctly. Is it such that \u2013 that's on the U.S. benefit plans. Is it such that if interest rates do remain low that you will not need to continue to come up with new mitigating factors in the coming years? Is it such that over the next few years that this is sort of a permanent offset if interest rates remain low? Am I thinking about that right?","Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer","That's right, Ryan. The change to the U.S. plan is sort of baked into the base, so that will persist. In terms of cash contribution, in 2015 we contributed $195 million and we expect only a modest uptick in 2016, around $217 million.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's all. Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks a lot. Next question, please?","Operator","Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on MMA and thoughts on the organic growth, where it stands in size now, if there's any disparity between that and the more traditional Marsh book in terms of growth of profile or margin contribution. Anything you provide, I'd appreciate.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll take that to begin with and then hand it over to Peter to give more commentary. But the MMA is a core strategy of the firm and really was approved by the company's board in July of 2008. And I point that out just to say we've not only had changes of CEO at the parent company level, we've also had changes of CEO at the Marsh subsidiary level. But the strategy itself we've stuck to it, we've done the hard yards and we've built the business over multi years that we're incredibly proud of and we think well positioned for throughout future.","We always said in the past that we expected MMA to be able to deliver organic growth which was stronger than Marsh U.S. over time at an EBITDA margin which would be similar to Marsh's overall margins.","And so, Peter, do you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC","Thanks, Dan. As Dan said, that this has always been a well thought-out strategy. We like the segment in the middle market and it has been one that we wanted to grow in through acquisition and through organic growth. We've been able to attract the highest quality agencies in building MMA. And attributes of high-quality agencies are terrific people, track records of strong organic growth and they've been able to do that once we've acquired them. Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality.","A big part of the organic growth, though, is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot of in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA and that makes a very big difference.","And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So, not only are we growing the segment that's strategically where we wanted to be in, attracting the highest quality agencies, we're also investing in executing on sales capacity. And so the growth has been balanced across the U.S. and balanced between the H&V (34:57) and Property and Casualty.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Could you let us let us know what the revenue is for 2015 for MMA?","Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC","Well, the estimated annualized revenue is around $900 million.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Excellent. I appreciate that. I guess just another for overall business on the P&C side and regarding the growth for 2016. What's the pricing expectation do you have kind of baked in for the P&C market? And I guess, overall, how much of the business today is commission versus fee-based? So I'm trying to get some understanding or appreciation of the sensitivity to changes in P&C pricing.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'll take that to start and hand over to Peter. First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fees, I would bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a prolonged, long-term soft market, it puts downward pressure on fees as well in a competitive environment. So it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company, over long stretches of time because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect there to generally be a downward trend on rating levels.","Now, insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to an insurance company. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels.","But, Peter, you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC","There's not a lot to add, Dan. I think you captured a lot of it. I think what we've seen in the pricing has been \u2013 we've seen more falloff in 2015 compared to 2014. But the sequential from quarter to quarter we have not seen accelerate. So, we have seen more rate come off in 2015 in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And so we would expect that in 2016, it will be modest. I don't see it significantly accelerating. We've seen property come off a little bit more, but it's been very orderly, very measured, and we think it would be a balance.","In terms of how you should think about commission versus fee, we've mentioned that we're growing a lot in MMA, and so the commission we'll book is growing as a overall percentage of the book, not only from organic growth but as we're making more acquisitions, and then the international is driven more by commission.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So thank you, Charles.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please? Thank you, Charles. Next question.","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to...","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","...to spend some time on the outlook for Guy Carpenter. The growth picked up in the fourth quarter. So, first of all, was there anything kind of one time in there? And then also as you think about 2016 and the outlook for the rating environment as well as new business there, how do you see the growth within Guy Carpenter for the coming year?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and so first I just like to say about Guy Carpenter, it's been some tough sledding over the last couple of years of market conditions. But when we look over a long period of time, Guy Carpenter has grown its underlying revenue 22 out of the last 24 quarters. So, we feel very good about how they're positioned and what they're delivering to the firm, truly one of our crown jewels.","But, Alex, you want to add to this?","Alexander S. Moczarski - President and CEO, Guy Carpenter & Co., LLC","Thanks, Dan. So, let's bear in mind that the fourth quarter is our smallest quarter. But obviously we're very pleased with the 5%, and that came from good client retention. We had strong new facultative business in Latin America and the UK. And Marine Specialty, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative all outperformed. In addition, we got a maximum performance bonus from a major global client. So there's nothing one-off about it, but bear in mind it is our smallest quarter.","We remain innovative and we remain relevant to our different segments. We've added new resources to our existing highly talented pool. We made investments in leading-edge client-facing technologies, and these are being recognized by our clients. And we're harnessing the alternative capital. We were top of the leagues in the cat bond space last year and we've got a good pipeline coming on.","And the good news I think is that some of our major clients have signaled their interests in returning to the reinsurance markets to meet their capital needs. So we can seek and expect revenue growth for this year. I'm not sure how much it's going to be. It may be bumpy. But we're a growth company and that's the way. We lean forward.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, I think, from where we sit today, I mean, we'll know more as the year progresses. But from where we sit today, if you look at Guy Carpenter's performance in 2015, it's probably the best indication of the full-year performance as to what we would expect in 2016 as well.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And then in terms of the acquisition pipeline, you, in your remarks, said that it was in good shape. Have you guys seen any change in multiples on transactions? And then also, as you think about 2016 and your capital plan, you did end the year with a sizeable transaction with the Jelf Group. How do you think about the size of potential transactions that are in the pipeline and what you might consider going forward?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question. A complicated question. It's got several parts to it. So let me talk about it broadly for a second. First of all, we do have a good pipeline. both in RIS and in consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline, though, we generally look at a lot of different things or at least cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few for a variety of reasons. So even last year, which was a very active year for us where we had 27 acquisitions and investments, we actually reviewed more than 10 times the amount of what we actually did. And so that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it.","And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year I can tell you even though we did $1.2 billion of transaction in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value and generally we walked away because of either concerns about growth, the difference between our view of what the potential growth could be in the future rather than the seller's view of what the potential growth could be, or price expectations.","And so we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number years we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for mid-size, smaller, folding, tuck-in type of acquisitions, the multiples, while they may be a bit more than they were five years ago, we still think are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think you would see Jelf was a bit of an outlier size-wise, not much of an outlier, but a bit. You look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last five years. The average acquisition transaction value has been a bit about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a string of pearls than chunkier than that. They'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way.","Now, in terms of capital plan, Mark, do you have some comments on that?","Mark Christopher McGivney - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think, overall, we maintained a balanced approach to a lot of elements of our strategy, and capital is no exception. As Dan said, we firmly believe that to drive value over the long term, we're going to consistently and continue to invest or reinvest in the business through M&A to extend our business, build our business. As he talked about, we maintain high standards in terms of discipline and expected returns. We expect to maintain this balance going forward. But it is balanced. And if you refer back to what we did in 2015, we deployed $1.2 billion of capital to acquisitions, but $2 billion of capital was returned to shareholders.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so if you look at our overall, we've been talking about returning capital of about $2.3 billion-ish for 2016. And if you think in terms of dividend, that probably is a number like $650 million to $700 million with a double-digit increase that we would deliver in 2016, which leaves you $1.6 billion maybe $1.7 billion between acquisitions and share repurchase. And the acquisition number is a question mark because we have no budget around acquisitions. But that level of return would exist and generally we would prefer if it was close to being balanced. But we'll work through that.","Any other questions, Elyse?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No. That was great. Thank you very much.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Perfect. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Quentin McMillan, KBW.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks very much, guys. I wanted to first ask just about the global growth in the RIS segment, particularly Latin America was obviously really strong this quarter. Wanting to understand if that was a little bit more chunky one-off because it was obviously a fairly challenged macro down there. And then more largely, what you're seeing in the developing markets and what you look for for 2016.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll hand over to Peter in a second, but I just can't resist celebrating our business in Latin America a little bit. So, Peter, I'm sorry if take some of the thunder on it. But I just want to say the fourth quarter and also the year, it's not at an anomaly at all for Marsh in Latin America. Marsh Latin America has grown underlying revenue 8% or more for six straight years. So, a tremendously strong performance through good times and tough times.","So, Peter, do you want to add?","Peter Zaffino - President & Chief Executive Officer, Marsh LLC","We had a terrific fourth quarter. 13% was led by Peru, Mexico and Colombia. So, those are three out of the four top countries in terms of size in Latin America. We did have a weaker fourth quarter in 2014. So perhaps the growth is a little bit more than perhaps the run rate. We did 8% for the year. But if I look at the fundamentals, we had really strong client retention, very good renewal growth from the rollover of new business in the prior year. But, again, strong client retention, and we grew through new business. So, they really executed on a balanced basis and really pleased with the recovery for the year. And as Dan said, it's been six straight years with 8% or greater. And we just have a terrific business there.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks so much. And then just following up on the M&A question, 2hat we've seen in the high-yield markets of spreads really starting to widen seems like it's going to make it harder for some of those private equity competitors who have been bidding up these deals, as you previously alluded to, to continue to try to maybe outbid you, guys or pay economic values that are just not sustainable. A, is that a trend that you have seen in any way in the marketplace so far? And, B, is that something that you guys are monitoring and think could be a potential positive going down the line?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So it's certainly a potential positive. It takes a while to turn up, I would say. So, we haven't seen anything and we very rarely actually compete with PE. I know plenty of people do, but ultimately our general attitude with regard to acquisitions is we very rarely, if at all, participate in auctions and, if PE is involved, we almost always take a pass because we want the owners to have made up their mind as to whether they want to be part of Marsh & McLennan Companies, part of a strategic long-term viable operation or whether they're looking to optimize compensation in the short term and they're willing to roll the dice as to what the ultimate outcome and the ultimate owner someday down the road would be. And so we don't bump up against PE as much as you would think.","Quentin McMillan - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Next question, please?","Operator","We have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, that's fine. That's probably a record. But I would just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and thank our colleagues specifically for their support and our clients for all the good things that we do together and wish everybody a good day. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"14295":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2016 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They're available on the company's Web site at www.mmc.com.","Please note the remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site.","During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release.","I'll now turn the call over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Daniel Glaser","Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and our operating company CEOs \u2013 Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, I would like to highlight a recent addition to our management team. Earlier this month, John Doyle joined Marsh as President, reporting to Peter Zaffino. John is also a member of the Executive Committee of MMC. Many of you know John, a highly regarded insurance industry leader. Most recently, he was CEO of AIG's Commercial Insurance business worldwide. John's appointment illustrates our continuing commitment to retain and attract talented professionals to Marsh & McLennan.","Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few moments talking about Brexit. It is a timely issue with the upcoming June vote. We have a significant presence in the UK and in Europe. And London is important as a major global insurance center. As you would expect, we have considered the potential ramifications for MMC. As I have said previously, we are supportive of the EU and believe Britain's inclusion makes both Britain and the EU stronger economically, politically, and strategically. On a macro level, while difficult to predict what the ultimate effects might be, Brexit would likely create an environment of uncertainty and volatility for the UK and the entire EU. This could last for last several years with potentially significant economic and political outcomes. The EU would be a weaker institution without the UK, which is its second largest economy and third largest population. And Britain's exit from the EU could jeopardize London's position as a major financial center.","From a business perspective, we think Brexit will provide opportunities as well as challenges for MMC. Frankly, there are too many variables to predict the revenue impact, positive or negative, at this time. The immediate impact to MMC will be increased FX volatility as our exposure to the pound is relatively high. That said, we think the impact of the significant weakening of the pound on MMC will be negligible. The RIS segment would have a positive impact, owing to its natural hedge of having some US dollar revenue on international placements in London, while the foreign-exchange effect on consulting would be negative.","Brexit is just one of many issues the global economy has faced during the last six years. Our clients rely on us even more during uncertain times. And we've done well for many years in a variety of challenging market environments. We've seen volatility around oil prices and FX, declining interest rates, political instability, and lower P&C insurance pricing. Over that time, the MMC team has consistently delivered strong performance. Despite headwinds, we've grown underlying revenue in a range of of 3% to 5% annually for six years in a row and we expect to do so in 2016.","Our vast geographic footprint allows us to weather regional growth pressures and provides us balance. While there is growth somewhere in the world, we'll be on the ground to find it and capture it.","We're also in growth businesses as a trusted advisor helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Our greatest resource is our people. We generate ideas and solutions and can pivot for opportunities for growth anywhere across our businesses.","Periods of stress also present opportunities. An important part of our strategy is to preserve flexibility to capitalize on market dislocations when they occur. We will continue to invest regardless of any near-term volatility. We believe in the long term and have built the firm to achieve sustained growth in earnings. We believe in balance between delivering strong financial performance today, while investing for our future.","Now, let me turn to our results. I'm pleased with MMC's operating performance in the first quarter. We had a strong start to the year and results were consistent with our plan to generate strong EPS growth for 2016 with underlying revenue growth and margin expansion in both segments. MMC generated underlying revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter with growth across all four of our operating companies. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter that we've increased underlying revenue by at least 3%.","We're pleased with our profitability in the quarter. You will remember that last year's first quarter results included a significant credit resulting from changes to our retiree medical benefit in the United States. If you normalize the impact from retirement expense, we produce double-digit EPS growth with margin expansion in both segments. Mark will walk you through the details.","Looking at our Risk & Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $543 million. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion. Underlying growth was 2% with all major geographic regions contributing.","In the US\/Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, led by continuing strong performance of Marsh & McLennan Agency, partially offset by weakness in Canada.","The international division also expanded 2%. EMEA rose 1%. Asia-Pacific grew 3% and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $374 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Strong new business growth in global specialties, primarily in marine and EMEA led the way.","In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $238 million. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3%. On a geographic basis, the revenue increase was led by growth markets and North America.","By line of business, health was the biggest driver of growth, contributing 6%. Investments was up 1%, which follows 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Talent was up 1% and retirement was flat.","Oliver Wyman had an excellent first quarter. Revenue was $439 million, reflecting exceptional underlying growth of 15% with all regions contributing. The increase was led by strong performance in the financial services practice. We expect Oliver Wyman's rate of growth to moderate over the balance of the year as comparisons to the prior year get more difficult.","In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter results, which provide a good start to the year. For the full year 2016, we expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range, meaningful margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%, all this while continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies, while maintaining control of operating expense. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91. And adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.92.","As Dan mentioned, I will walk you through the retirement related items that make our earnings comparisons to last year's first quarter challenging and give you more clarity around our underlying results.","You will recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a non-recurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our US retiree medical plan. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit not only for 2016, but beyond. As discussed on our last two earnings calls, the most impactful of these changes was to divide our US defined benefit plan into two separate plans.","As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into the measurement of our annual pension expense, we expect the year-over-year decline in retirement expense for 2016 of approximately $30 million or $0.04 per share. Although retirement expense will decline for the full year, it increased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year ago because of the significant credit we recorded in last year's first quarter. The increase in retirement expense in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015 was roughly $0.10 per share.","Eliminating this impact, in the first quarter of 2016, MMC produced double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, high-single-digit growth in adjusted operating income, and meaningful margin expansion in both segments. For the year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments, and strong growth in earnings per share, with improving growth in the second half of the year.","Moving to investment income, we had a loss of $3 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million from a year ago. As we said on our last call, going forward, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with the $38 million we reported in 2015. This anticipated reduction for 2016 will likely offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense I mentioned earlier. It is worth reiterating that the full year benefit from lower retirement expense is essentially offset by investment income -- our reduced investment income. This means that the financial performance we are expecting for 2016 will continue to come from strong underlying operating performance.","We reported last year that we expected foreign exchange to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016, with the majority occurring in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the impact in the quarter was $0.03. However, the dollar has weakened over the past several weeks against many of our key currencies. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, which was a big assumption given FX volatility in recent periods, we now expect the impact from FX to be de minimis for the remainder of the year.","Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter to quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, changes in international and local tax rates and other discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 28.5% compared with 29.4% in last year's first quarter. Our rate in the quarter was slightly below the 29% we guided to for 2016 due to discrete items recorded in the period. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.","Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at year-end. In addition to the $350 million of senior notes we issued in March, total debt includes 250 million of commercial paper outstanding. ","As we discussed in the past, we utilized the commercial paper market throughout the year for short-term liquidity and greater cash management flexibility. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 27.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $918 million, with approximately $190 million in the US. ","Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past seven years; $200 million for share repurchases; $161 million for dividends; and $121 million for acquisitions and investments.","For the full year 2016, we plan to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, and acquisition. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments, to reduce our share count, and increase our dividends per share by double-digit.","And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks, Mark. Matt, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Jay Gelb with Barclays. ","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. It would be helpful, Mark, for us if you could just give us what your view is of baseline 2015 adjusted EPS as there are a lot of moving parts last year, especially around the retirement plan?","Daniel Glaser","So, Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","Yeah. Sure, Jay. I think the best way to think about this is 2016 reflects a good baseline. It\u2019s really the one-time nature of the credit we had in the first quarter of last year, which I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at year-over-year retirement expense, the impact was roughly $0.10 a share in the first quarter. But I think 2016 is a good baseline.","Jay Gelb","In terms of the outlook for close to the 13% EPS growth for 2016, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what 2015 baseline was\u2026?","Mark McGivney","Remember, when we talked about last year, we encouraged people to think about our full year results. So I think if you look at our results for the full year, our $3.05 last year is a good number for us for baseline for 2015.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s what I thought. Just wanted to make sure. My second question is on the share buybacks. The $2.3 billion of capital deployment in dividends, share buybacks, and acquisitions was the same, as you said, at the end of the year. The buyback pace is a little faster than I would\u2019ve anticipated in the first quarter, so I just wanted to get a sense of whether $1 billion of share buybacks in 2016 is still a reasonable assumption?","Daniel Glaser","Jay, we\u2019ve never outlined a number of $1 billion. We actually said a couple of times in previous calls that we expect the return of capital to shareholders to look more similar to 2014, which was a number of like $2.3 billion. And so, if you look at that, and you say, \u2018well, dividends are going to be $650 million to $700 million,\u2019 it leaves you about $1.6 billion, maybe $1.7 billion between acquisitions and share repurchase.","Just to be clear, share repurchase for us is an important commitment, and our commitment is to reduce the share count each year. We actually favor organic investments in our business, our dividend strategy, and our acquisition strategy over share repurchase. But if we favor share repurchase over building cash on our balance sheet, and I think that\u2019s the way to look at it.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. Then my final question, I\u2019m certain my estimates are not as important, based on the actual results, the RIS margin for this quarter is a lot higher than I would\u2019ve thought and Consultings margin was lower than I would\u2019ve expected. Is there anything we should keep in mind on that mix of margin, especially relative to the year-over-year comparisons?","Daniel Glaser","No, I think when you look at \u2013 and I\u2019ll hand over to Mark in a second because he can go through a little bit about what was in the first quarter of last year versus what\u2019s not. In our view, both RIS and Consulting have been on a multi-year expansion of margin track, and that\u2019s continuing. And the noise in terms of the big credit that we had in the first quarter of last year, what we said last year was that, it did not impact Consulting all that much, but it was really weighted toward RIS. And that maybe is one of the reasons why you were talking about your estimates a second ago. But, Mark, what would you say about that?","Mark McGivney","Just a couple of things. I would say the first quarter 2016 represents a fair baseline. And when you look back to last year, remember that the two headwinds we were dealing with \u2013 both a significant increase in pension expense and FX and the one-time credit, so \u2013 and I know it\u2019s a little tough to compare year-over-year. If you think about what a good baseline is, I think our results this year are fair \u2013 a fair baseline.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much.","Daniel Glaser","Okay, take care, Jay. Next question?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Quentin McMillan with KBW.","Quentin McMillan","Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to touch on the strong growth that you had out of the US and Canada. You put up 10% growth overall. The 2% organic was maybe just a touch below what I would\u2019ve expected, but the 9% M&A growth, can you talk about where the growth \u2013 how the growth is working for Marsh & McLennan Agency, maybe where Marsh & McLennan Agency\u2019s overall revenue base is currently, and any expectations that you sort of have for that business and related to the M&A growth?","Daniel Glaser","So, basically, I\u2019ll start it off and then I\u2019ll hand over to Peter to talk a little bit about MMA and MMA strategy. And, first of all, we\u2019ve always been a company that is built upon underlying growth and growing our existing businesses on a same office, same line of business basis and making sure that we never become reliant on acquisitions for growth. Having said that, we have an acquisition strategy. And over the last couple of years, we have acquired more firms and committed to more capital to acquisitions because of the opportunities that we saw. None bigger than Marsh & McLennan Agency. But, Peter, you want to talk about where MMA is currently?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. Thank you, Dan. The answer is going to be very similar to some of my commentary in some of the prior quarters. The premise behind MMA has been that the middle market in the United States provides an opportunity for higher growth in the large accounts base, and that has largely proven to be true. We think it\u2019s a very good segment. We\u2019ve acquired the highest quality agencies, just adding Celedinas in the first quarter which is a high net worth personal lines agency, best-in-class, out of Palm Beach. We\u2019ve shared best practices. We\u2019ve been heavily investing in sales capacity. And we have a very balanced business between employee health and benefits and property and casualty. So we\u2019re very pleased with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made. Strong organic growth.","And I think the last part of your question was just roughly what the size is. And we think, by year-end, with no more acquisitions, if we weren\u2019t to do any \u2013 we do have a very strong pipeline \u2013 but as of today, the annualized revenue is approximately $950 million.","Quentin McMillan","Thanks very much. And then secondly, just a slightly bigger picture question, a couple of the underwriters have talked about a little bit of a back-and-forth with the brokers in terms of commission percentage and what\u2019s going on with the weaker rate environment. Can you guys just comment in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in working with your underwriter partners and the give-and-take between what your commission rates have been and where that stands now?","Daniel Glaser","I guess that\u2019s confirmation that prices \u2013 or at least waiting levels are under pressure when you get some of the tit-for-tat between the brokerage community and the underwriting community. The people around this stable have been on both sides of that aisle and have been involved in the market for a long time. So we\u2019ve seen many cycles. And so, I would say right of the back, this, to me, doesn\u2019t strike us as unusual in any way. The market itself, over the last 30 years, has almost always been highly competitive with bouts of reactionary, episodic tightening. But, in general terms, it\u2019s usually always very competitive. And so, we have built our business around the capability of operating in highly competitive insurance market cycles, not around operating when the market is tightening.","I can\u2019t really explain to you in depth. I\u2019ll leave it up to them as to why underwriters write more new business when rates are declining than when rates are rising or why they are willing to provide higher levels of retail commissions when rates are reducing versus when rates are rising. I\u2019ll leave that over to them to talk through. But we are operating in our strategy. We don\u2019t think anything untoward. Our relationships with our carrier partners are very close, perhaps closer than at any time in my career. We work on a lot of strategic projects together, showing how we can build our business and grow the pie to the mutual benefit of our clients.","Do you have any other questions?","Quentin McMillan","No, that\u2019s great. Thanks very much, guys. And congrats on the quarter.","Daniel Glaser","Okay, next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. Just to pick up on that a little bit on the MMC Agency side, what is organic growth \u2013 the organic and inorganic growth look like as far as that subset, MMC Agency? Is that something you could just give us some indication of what that\u2019s tracking right now?","Daniel Glaser","No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to break out the Agency as a subset. We haven\u2019t done that before. And I know if we do it once, we\u2019ll do it forevermore. So I think we\u2019re going to keep that to ourselves. I would say what to refer to is the strategy that we laid out all the way back in late 2009. Our basic premise was, we believe we could create the highest quality agency in the United States and end up with a SMEs and middle market and upper middle market company which was well balanced between property and casualty, employee benefits, and personal lines, and that that would grow faster organically than overall Marsh at a similar or higher level of EBITDA margin. And that strategy is holding. But we\u2019re not going to break out the subset.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. I guess it\u2019s getting close to Guy Carpenter size. Does there comes a point in terms of just thinking about standalone, where you\u2019ll consider that or it is what it is?","Daniel Glaser","We are currently in the it-is-what-it-is phase of development of MMA. But it still has a tremendous amount of runway. And I imagine, at some point in time, we will consider whether that should be broken out and shown separately. But it certainly won\u2019t be anytime in the near future.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it, okay. And then, just quickly on the Consulting side, with Oliver Wyman growing as fast as it has, with all due respect, you guys have been talking about slowing growth there for a long time. It just keeps going. How should we think about the margin impact in Consulting if Oliver Wyman continues to run ahead of the rest of the business from a growth perspective? Was that a net headwind or a tailwind for margins of that segment if that continues to happen?","Daniel Glaser","Couple of things. I think it\u2019s important for us to have an overall view of the Consulting segment. One, you have to just start with looking at the size of Mercer relative to the size of Oliver Wyman and recognize that if Mercer isn\u2019t generating margin improvement, it would be very hard for the segment to show margin improvement regardless of where the top line is for Oliver Wyman at any point in time.","Clearly, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue performance over the past two years. But I would just caution everybody that the vast majority of Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue is non-recurring project work. And so, new projects have to be added continuously for us to even maintain levels of revenue, let alone grow it. So we know, as a leadership team, that Oliver Wyman will have a more \u2013 higher level of volatility on the top line than any of the other three opcos. And that is one of the reasons why we have built a model where Oliver Wyman\u2019s compensation model is very performance-sensitive. So their expense base naturally \u2013 their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefit, naturally flexes with their revenue line, and so \u2013 up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact. ","Michael Nannizzi","Perfect. Thanks so much. ","Daniel Glaser","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on Guy Carpenter. The growth was stronger than you saw within Marsh in the quarter. I know that\u2019s an area that you guys have been making some new hires. Are you going to just talk about the new business and the growth that you are seeing there, as well as just provide an outlook on based on the current market conditions for the balance of the year?","Daniel Glaser","Sure. Alex?","Alexander Moczarski","Okay. We\u2019re very pleased with the 3% underlying growth. That\u2019s probably stronger than we had expected and we had strong new business and the pipeline remains good. Tailwinds, we\u2019ve been facing for the last five years, but we still achieved organic growth in 27 of the last 29 quarters. So we are a sort of forward-leaning company and we know how to grow it. New business was very good in the specialties area, in EMEA. The other regions were strong, particularly on the retention side.","The new hires that we brought in have had some effect so far, but actually we\u2019re expecting to see more of that effect coming through the following months, particularly as we increase our participation with the larger companies, with a very nicely balanced organization, and we think that we\u2019ll be able to continue with moderate growth for the rest of the year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. And then just a little bit on the growth within Marsh, I know you mentioned strong growth still within MMA, but, overall, Marsh did slow a little bit in the Q1. How do you think about the next three quarters of the year? Any growth trends that might cause you to change that outlook or you might think that the number might come in a little bit higher during the back half of the year?","Daniel Glaser","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Elyse. In a business the size of Marsh, there\u2019s always a lot going on. As you said, the 2% underlying growth, if you compare it to the fourth quarter, I would encourage just to take a look at the full year. The first quarter 2016 does represent the 24th consecutive quarter of underlying revenue growth. So I\u2019m very proud of Marsh that we\u2019ve been able to build an organization that can generate organic growth in the short, medium and long-term.","As Dan mentioned and I reiterated, we have very strong performance in MMA, but we also had solid growth across our emerging markets and very good growth in employee health and benefits.","Having said that, there were few things that tempered growth in the quarter. The first quarter is highly dependent on the mature markets within Marsh, particularly Continental Europe, which renews about half of its book in the first quarter. And we have a terrific business in Continental Europe. But just based on the macros and insurance conditions, it has historically grown in the low-single-digits and that\u2019s what happened in this quarter as well.","We are facing some headwinds in the insurance market. We know there is an abundance of capacity. We\u2019ve had a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter. It did temper, but it is \u2013 it\u2019s been happening for the better part of the last few years. And we continue to weather the slowdown in some of the commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil. Great businesses, but just a little bit of tempered on the growth.","So if I step back and take a broader view, I\u2019m really pleased with the key fundamentals, meaning the clients that we\u2019re retaining, strong new business, continue to expand into new products, had a terrific progress we\u2019ve made on cyber. We\u2019re about up 80% year-over-year on brokerage and in premium and expect to see a very strong trend continue. And our investments are highly driven by delivering superior value to clients and I feel really good where we are.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks, Peter. Elyse, anything is?","Elyse Greenspan","Just one quick question, in terms of \u2013 you guys did mention on the leverage increase modestly, building up in the first quarter. How do you think about your leverage ratio for the balance of the year and just in terms of how that might impact your capital return? Thank you.","Daniel Glaser","I think the way to look at it is is that the leverage ratio will move around a little bit with EBITDA and with the timing of when we raise debt and that sort of thing. But we ended last year at about 1.6. And whether we were at 1.5 or 1.8, we\u2019re in a range of debt-to-equity type of \u2013 debt-to-EBITDA type of leverage. I would say we\u2019ll just remain in that range for the foreseeable future.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you.","Daniel Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Larry Greenberg with Janney.","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. Just going to try one more on M&A. So the contribution in the quarter for Marsh was higher than it\u2019s been in a long time. I\u2019m just wondering, given the transactions that you\u2019ve done to-date, is that a reasonable run rate contribution for the next quarter too?","Daniel Glaser","I think I\u2019ll start with that. But I would say it really depends on the timing of when the larger acquisitions come in. I don\u2019t have the schedule right in front of me, but my guess is that that kind of run rate only lasts for a short period of time until we start laughing when we pull in other acquisitions from previous years. And so, from that standpoint, it\u2019s dependent in large part as to whether we do anything in the short term now either in terms of what kind of acquisitions we put on. But, basically, when we look at acquisitions\u2019 overall impact on revenue, it\u2019s been between 2% and 3% over the last several years. And I think that\u2019s probably, as a total company, a better way of looking at what acquisitions are doing to our revenues, 2% to 3%.","Larry Greenberg","Okay. And then, Mark, I know you said FX de minimis over the balance of the year, but will we still see a negative impact in the second quarter and then maybe that offset over the second half?","Daniel Glaser","Mark, do you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","I think, Larry, and as I said in my prepared remarks, this change \u2013 and I just want to emphasize that the outlook that we\u2019ve given is based on rates \u2013 spot rates this week. We\u2019re at the point where the euro is now up 5% from where it was a year ago, the yen is up 9%, and the Aussie dollar is flat. But if we had gone back a month ago, the guidance would have been different. So just take it all with a grain of salt. But that de minimis comment would carry for the next three quarters, so second quarter as well.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks.","Daniel Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. So first question for Mark. And thank you for the detail about the EPS impact year-over-year. I just want to drill down to the margin impact because looks like, by my calculation, if you take out $125 million margin benefit in the first quarter 2015, so the year-over-year margin actually improved about 170 basis points. I just want to confirm that.","And also, if that\u2019s the case, so it\u2019s very strong compared with the margin expansion for the past few quarters. So I just wonder, given the current 3% to 5% organic growth, you can still deliver that strong margin expansion going forward.","Daniel Glaser","Yeah, Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","As I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks, the net impact is about $0.10. If you do the math, it\u2019s roughly $75 million. So, remember, the $125 million one-time in the first quarter of last year, so pension expense is also down this year somewhat as well. So you really have to take out both pieces. So we did say we had \u2013 when you make this adjustment, meaningful margin expansion overall and in both segments. But I think if you use $75 million, not the $125 million, you get closer to the right ZIP code.","Kai Pan","Okay. And then the larger picture question is that a lot of carriers talking about market disruption from both M&A as well as some reorganizations. I just wondered, from a brokers\u2019 perspective, where do you see opportunities?","Daniel Glaser","So I\u2019ll take that broadly and then I\u2019ll other hand over to Peter to talk a little bit more about the impact of re-underwriting and acquisitions and consolidation. Generally, when we look at it, I think we said it in a couple of calls ago, with all the consolidation, there\u2019s actually more insurance companies in our space in the United States than there were 10 or 15 years ago. And so, it\u2019s still a very fragmented, competitive marketplace. And we see very little \u2013 there used to be \u2013 when I look earlier in my career, say, 25 years ago or so, there was this huge qualitative difference between the larger carriers and midsize carriers. Because the midsize carriers, in large part, are staffed in leadership teams with people who came from the larger carriers, that qualitative distance between the two doesn\u2019t play out quite as readily. And so, there\u2019s ample companies for us to talk to and have meaningful relationships with and discussions with our clients with in a tripartite way. We have really core relationships.","If anything, this level of refocus from some of the larger carriers has created a deeper closeness between the working teams at Marsh and their counterparts in the underwriting companies to make sure that \u2013 we want our clients to be with people who want to write that account. And so, we want to make sure we know clearly what the underwriting appetite is and what the commitment to the future is. And so, therefore, there\u2019s been a lot of dialogue and a lot of interaction at a strategic level. So we feel pretty good about where we are. But, Peter, you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to add, Dan. I think you covered most of the key points. We want to make sure that we are focusing on providing the best advice to our clients, with all the changing dynamics that are happening in the industry. While there\u2019s been a decent amount of changes, perhaps through acquisitions and some of the leadership changes, by and large, across the world, the risk appetites have not changed that much. We are trying to find ways in which we can create more product, whether it\u2019s in cyber or in terrorism or making sure that we simplify the insurance product. And so, I would add, as Dan said, we have such a close relationship with so many of the insurance companies and trading partners that we\u2019re always trying to improve the experience for our clients and making sure that we are anticipating the changes that are happening around the corner and not just being stagnant in today\u2019s market. But by and large, we don\u2019t see anything that is a major dislocation for clients and I think it\u2019s \u2013 we will continue to trade as we have in the past.","Kai Pan","Thank you.","Daniel Glaser","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Sarah DeWitt with JP Morgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. On the brokerage organic growth of 2%, is that a level where you think you can expand margins over the long-term?","Daniel Glaser","Peter, you want to take that? And why don\u2019t you talk about a little bit more broadly because we don\u2019t do margins for individual opcos? But if you just look at that kind of level in RIS overall, what would your comments be?","Peter Zaffino","The 2% long-term growth, it\u2019s hard to make significant investments as well as expand margin. But we\u2019ve been making a lot of investments over the past five to seven years. And we are in a place where if we had 2% over the short, medium term, I think there are opportunities to expand margin because we built in a lot of efficiencies within Marsh. An example would be, in the United States, something called a Qualified Solutions Group. It\u2019s an investment we made three or four years ago to streamline the process of placement, working with insurance companies to get more contract certainty, using technology to make it more efficient for our client experience, and just getting a better product with some of our largest trading partners. That is something that, I think, will yield deficiencies and opportunities for margin expansion through top line growth and lower expense. So we\u2019ve made a lot of investments over time. But if you\u2019re in a multi-year 2%, it is hard to expand margins. But don\u2019t think that\u2019s the world we are in.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay.","Daniel Glaser","Any other questions, Sarah?","Sarah DeWitt","And just to clarify, the 3% to 5% organic growth this year, is that for each segment or just the company overall?","Daniel Glaser","No, that\u2019s when we look at the company overall.","Sarah DeWitt","Could brokerage, risk and insurance services be in that range as well?","Daniel Glaser","It\u2019s hard to tell. Certainly, our expectation is not that we have any kind of long period where brokerage is operating below 3% organic growth. But there could be periodic periods where that happens and we\u2019ll manage the business accordingly.","If I look at my brokerage segment and you effect for the pension credits we were talking about before and eliminate those from last year and this year in terms of the way you look at the business, both segments increased their margins. So RIS increased their margins in the first quarter despite the level of growth. And so, I\u2019m pretty comfortable we could manage the business. But we\u2019ve said several times in the past, as a company, we believe we drive for margin when the company grows at 3% or better. And if the company grows less than that, our margins may improve because of the efficiency gains et cetera. But our view is, generally, we are more comfortable growing margins when our organic growth is 3% or better.","Sarah DeWitt","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Daniel Glaser","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.","Dave Styblo","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. First one was, just a little bit on the competitive landscape, and one of your peers earlier reported about retention levels that just weren\u2019t as high as they had wanted. Curious to hear or see, are you guys continuing to track along what you\u2019d expect for your given market share, your pro rata growth of the end market or has this been a period where you\u2019ve maybe been able to pick up a few lives \u2013 excuse me, some additional membership to \u2013 from the employer base to help offset the pressures that we\u2019re talking about in Continental Europe and so forth?","Daniel Glaser","Yeah, I would say, overall, throughout, whether you\u2019re looking at Consulting or RIS, our account and revenue retentions are very consistent with where they\u2019ve been in the past. And so, there has been no impact. We absolutely do believe in each of our segments that there is a potential future benefit from flight to quality in times of uncertainty and volatility, which we would pick up in the future. But, today, it\u2019s very competitive. We\u2019ve been maintaining our positions on accounts and our client level of retention and revenue retention on those clients is very consistent with how it\u2019s been over the last several years.","Dave Styblo","Very good, okay. If I could drill into the margins a little bit more, starting in RIS, so I know in the first quarter of 2015, I think you guys talked about a normalized margin of 27.6%. So off that, we\u2019re up 150 basis points, so maybe some of the pension changes here helped that a little bit. But can you bridge us to the increase, especially in light of the organic growth being maybe at the lower end of your range? I know, obviously, you\u2019ve made these investments you\u2019ve talked about over the last five to seven years, maybe that\u2019s paying dividends. But was there any sort of one-off activity that helped margins or what is driving that margin increase?","Daniel Glaser","I\u2019ll just repeat some of the things that I\u2019ve said earlier in previous years. Margins are important, obviously, and they are part of how we drive to get to our long-term CAGR of 13% on EPS. But when we run our business and we create our own strategies, margins are one of the financial metrics that we care about least. We look at organic growth. We look at operating income and earnings growth and we look about the air between our revenue growth and our expense growth. And so, margins are a natural outcome of us managing the business properly, right? So that is the fundamental strategic view.","I can tell you, I really don\u2019t give a hoot about margins in any one quarter. We run our business in a way of, how did we do over the course of year \u2013 one year and multiyear basis. Our margins have been on a track. We\u2019ve been talking about margins with the investment community for a lot of years now. And I just have to say that 2016 is going to be the ninth consecutive year of margin expansion and the seventh consecutive year of margin expansion in both segments. And so, our margins are going to go up as an outcome of the way we run the business. But in terms of the inside baseball of margin in one quarter versus margin in another quarter is not meaningful to us.","Dave Styblo","Fair enough. Fair enough. Thanks.","Daniel Glaser","Okay, thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Hate to follow this up with another question on margins, but just curious, thinking about the currency, that\u2019s clearly been a headwind for so long. How should we think about that? Is that \u2013 does it flip to a tailwind? What\u2019s been the headwind for margins, if any, and what type of positive impact could that have if the dollar is no longer a headwind?","Daniel Glaser","If you look over the past several years, we\u2019ve talked, for example, how constant currency last year, we would have produced something like 14% or 14.5% EPS growth rather than the 8% or 8.2% or so that we posted. So, clearly, it\u2019s been a headwind for, like, five years. I should say, over a 20-year period, it\u2019s been a wash. But in shorter periods, it, obviously, has an impact. If we get a tailwind on FX, boy, will we be happy? And it would translate into easier ability to make our typical long-term 13% CAGR on EPS. And so, we view that as an absolute positive development if it happens. But I\u2019m not sure if there is anything more I can say on that. Mark, do you have anything?","Mark McGivney","2015 was such an unusual year for FX. But, generally, FX has kind of gone plus and minus in a range and it has generally a modest impact on margins that we really haven\u2019t talked about. And the impact even in the early part of this year has been relatively modest. So we really don\u2019t think about it all that deeply in a normal year. ","Ryan Tunis","Okay. So modest impact on margins. And then, I guess, just shifting gears over to Mercer. And, I guess, looking at the organic growth in investments and just trying to parse through how much of that is just difficult comps, the new business environment, or to the extent to which the macro environment or just the investing environment in general could drive what organic growth could end up being for 2016?","Daniel Glaser","Ryan, I want to give you a pat on the back because I was worried about Julio napping at the end of the table. So, Julio, you want to take that?","Julio Portalatin","Yeah, Ryan. Thanks for waking me up. Very appreciated.","Let me see if I can do a little level-setting and then I\u2019ll get into the investments business. The Mercer portfolio, as you know, is a pretty diversified and balanced portfolio, whether you speak of it in terms of geography or line of business or any kind of portfolio or client segment. And as you can imagine, there can be puts and takes across a portfolio in any one quarter. But we have consistently now delivered growth for several quarters in a row.","More importantly, we are well-positioned to continue to produce short, medium and long-term profitable growth. As you\u2019ve heard me speak about before, we\u2019re very disciplined in disinvesting in areas where we cannot achieve that profitable growth and investing in areas that we can on a consistent basis. A good example of that is the way we repositioned the portfolio around growth strategies; investments being one of them; health exchanges; workday implementation, you\u2019ve seen us invest there; Alexander Forbes, improving our geographic footprint; while disinvesting, for example, in the recent decision be made on DC admin recordkeeping business. So we continue to do that as a dynamic and discipline in the organization that\u2019s now built into our culture.","As it relates to the investments business, I think you already mentioned that we had a tough comparison in the quarter to the first quarter 2015, in which we had exceptional growth of 13%. I must tell you, though, that overall, though, investment pipeline is strong. It\u2019s looking good. There will be some, again, gyrations because of external environment on occasion. But the investments we\u2019ve made and the kind of client organic growth that we are experiencing continues to give us great confidence that they will contribute to profitable growth.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then I just had one really quick one for Mark. Just thinking about the pensions stuff, I don\u2019t want to call it the offset, but the lower pension expense this year, is that more disproportionately located in Risk Services versus Consulting? Thanks.","Daniel Glaser","Mark, do you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","No, I would think about it sort of distributed \u2013 there are many ways to get at it. But, no, it is something \u2013 our employee populations participate across our operating companies in our plan. So I think you can think about it, if you use revenue as a base or employees as a base or comp and benefits, I think you\u2019ll be fine. But it affects the whole company.","Daniel Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. Thank you for getting me in. I know there\u2019s been a lot of talk about margins and I don\u2019t want to talk about them from the basis of this quarter or quarter-over-quarter. But I\u2019d appreciate you guys\u2019 thought on a multi-year basis. What can the business get assuming you keep your 3% organic growth, right? There\u2019s margin. Is there an upward bound, I guess, is what I\u2019m thinking? If you think about \u2013 if I think of the RIS business, it was 22.5% operating margin last year. Can this be a 26% or 27% business in the future? Is there headwinds where you get \u2013 a point where you reach where it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s as far as it goes at the compensation levels or other parts that there is just some natural impediment? Where is the upward bound in a normal operating environment for the business?","Daniel Glaser","Yeah. There\u2019s a couple of things. One, you\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t actually like creating target numbers on things like margin because I think targets have a way of people trying to get there or touch it as being, \u2018okay, target achieved,\u2019 and then you see it shrink back again. At the end of the day, I do not want to create boundaries on how either of our segments could perform in the future. We have all kinds of advantages in terms of efficiency, technology, expense synergies, revenue synergies that we\u2019re capturing within the company. So comparisons to how the company operated in a decade or 15 years ago are not really that relevant for us. So I keep it very open in terms of \u2013 what I do say and what I know Peter and Julio and Alex and Scott say when we\u2019re talking to our teams is do not drive for margin at the expense of investing for the business or for organic growth. And so, from that perspective, I just think it\u2019s important for you to know the way we look at it.","Having said all of that, we\u2019ve been talking about margins essentially for the last eight years. And the story for us has been pretty consistent. We expect to be able to grow margins because we run our business in a way that expenses almost always grow at a slower pace than revenue. We expect to continue to do that. Clearly, that level of difference varies based upon when our margins get up to, let\u2019s say, very high levels sometime into the future. Then we\u2019ll be very happy to grow expenses at the same pace as revenue because we would have such a fantastic business. We already have market-leading margins relative to the mega brokers, and so we feel pretty good about where they are.","And I\u2019ll just remind everybody that when we look at margins and talk about it, we look on a multiyear basis. As I look over the last four or five years, both segments have grown margins between 400 and 500 basis points. And so, I could\u2019ve easily set a target or some sort of threshold number four of five years ago because I remember conversations where people would say, \u2018well, do you think you can grow your margins 200 to 250 basis points from where they are today?\u2019 And, boy, am I glad that we didn\u2019t say yes to that and create some sort of hurdle to where we\u2019ve now felt we\u2019ve achieved it, so now we won\u2019t grow them anymore. We\u2019re just going to let the businesses run and see where that takes us. But we\u2019re quite confident that 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that you see expansion in both segments.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And I guess into the business and I think one of the things that might be helping that, I\u2019d be interested in any kind of color on the Marsh ClearSight, on the data and analytics. I guess I\u2019m curious, at this point, how prevalent that is within the book of business, if you could give any kind of example on how that might be helping to lead organic growth or just improving the business or retention as that part of the business seems to be gaining importance and recognition?","Daniel Glaser","Yeah. I\u2019ll just start by saying data analytics as a way for us to capture value from the scale advantages that we have in both of our segments is an important part of our future. And so, there is a significant amount of activity in each operating company in these fields of data analytics. ClearSight specifically is a unit within Marsh and, obviously, it has a focus on data and analytics, but Marsh\u2019s focus goes far beyond ClearSight. But, Peter, you want to add to that?","Peter Zaffino","Yeah. We\u2019ve started this journey many years ago in terms of trying to harness and capture the rich amount of data that exist within Marsh to the benefit of our clients. We have expanded our analytics platforms to be able to give our clients much more insight in terms of volatility, any catastrophe exposure, predictive modeling and really tying it all together. One great example of that is, as we rolled out an IMAP technology \u2013 and we think it\u2019s the industry\u2019s only mobile real-time analytics platform \u2013 that allows our clients to have interactive discussions with us based on market conditions, based on overlaying a rich database to show them benchmarking and peer reviews and we do measure RFP statistics where we have a full comprehensive analytics approach versus a more traditional, and our win ratio is significantly higher. And I think we will continue to make investments on the data analytics side. We have a significant amount of claims data and want to be very focused on the SME segment as well in terms of providing insight.","Charles Sebaski","Okay, thank you.","Daniel Glaser","No, go ahead, Charles.","Charles Sebaski","I was just wondering, is that data and analytics pushing down into MMA as well or is that product and service only within the more traditional Marsh side?","Peter Zaffino","It is pushing into MMA as well. There is just a different value proposition for middle market clients than there is for large clients. So the actual delivery of that is a bit different. But, yes, it is going into the mid-market and providing insight.","Daniel Glaser","Charles, and to other people on the call as well, I just want to make the point that data analytics and innovation in general is really across the piece. And there\u2019s a lot of activity within RIS, but there\u2019s certainly a lot of activity within Mercer and Oliver Wyman as well. Julio, you have a couple of things to say about that?","Julio Portalatin","Yeah. We\u2019ve been, of course, focusing on being able to understand more about behaviors of our clients and being able to apply it to some of our solutions. Health would be a very good example of that. As we continue to build, as an example, Mercer Marketplace, we\u2019re building our own database that we can be able to continue to look at and analyze and be able to make solutions tied to the relevant outcomes of that data analysis. And so, we have a lot of work going on around that.","The rest of our health portfolio, same thing. We\u2019ve also introduced all sorts of different ways to be able to attract the demands that are necessary to be served for clients. For example, Mercer Match is a new innovation that we put together that\u2019s based on collecting neuroscience data and also matching it with gamification, so that assessment of potential pools of candidates could be made much more easily with higher outcomes, positive outcomes for our clients.","In addition to that, another example would be Harmonise which we have launched in the UK, which is database-driven analytics that allows us to, in one-fell-swoop tool, deliver push information for individual employees to make decisions about \u2013 informed decisions about their benefit choices. And that\u2019s now been launched in the UK and also in Ireland. So the data is a very strong foundational base that is driving our innovations and our future solutions matching to our clients\u2019 needs.","Daniel Glaser","I think we have time for one more question, Operator.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee. ","Vinay Misquith","Hi. Can we just stick with one question? Given the 2% organic growth in the brokerage operations, if you could just help me understand the puts and takes on two fronts. Number one, the economy and \u2013 the stabilizing economy and how it has had an impact on organic growth? And, two, pricing, because, historically, we've seen when pricing was weak in the industry, the economy has been much stronger. Thank you.","Daniel Glaser","I\u2019d just say a couple of things and then, hopefully, I\u2019ll leave a little room for Peter. But just, overall, let\u2019s not get too technical here, it\u2019s one quarter. And if you look at the economic impact of one quarter, there\u2019s usually a significant lag factor between what GDP is doing and what\u2019s happening in the insurance arena. Peter, you want to talk a little bit about, let\u2019s say, exposure units versus rates and where we end up on that, whether it\u2019s positive or negative?","Peter Zaffino","Yeah. Dan, thank you. And we didn\u2019t talk a lot about pricing. But we did see pricing temper both sequentially and year-over-year in the quarter. So international business has a little bit more rate decrease when compared to the US and Canada. Property still leads the rate decreases, although it is tempering. And we have seen modest increases in exposure in total insured values, sales and payroll. And we\u2019ve also had a number of yield initiatives across the world. So when we aggregate everything, it really does amount to a modest headwind.","Daniel Glaser","Is that okay, Vinay?","Vinay Misquith","Yes, thank you.","Daniel Glaser","Okay, thanks a lot. And I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning. Even though he did not get a question, I\u2019d like to thank Scott and the Oliver Wyman team for growing 15% in the first quarter. So thank you very much.","I\u2019d like to thank our shareholders for their investment in our company, our clients for their support, and our colleagues for their dedication.","A core priority for us is to foster a culture of integrity, accountability and performance in everything we do. We are proud of the progress we have made and we\u2019re excited about the path before us. Have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's call.

Please go ahead sir.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO and our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","We had another year of outstanding performance in 2014 capped by a strong fourth quarter. We are a global growth company with many enduring qualities; talented colleagues, deep client relationships, a vast global footprint, depth of intellectual capital, a collaborative culture which seeks to harness our collective intelligence, a proven leadership team known for keeping its commitments and delivering results. At Marsh & McLennan we do important work enabling our client success by helping them address the challenges and opportunities of our time. The current global landscape is one brisling with increasing risks, but also opportunities. Cyber security, political and economic uncertainty in the euro zone, slowing economic growth in developing economies, plunging oil prices, historically low interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar all of these trends have gained momentum in the past six months illustrating not only the issues governments, multinational corporations and most organizations face but how the speed of change presents its own set of challenges. In an increasingly complex and dynamic world, C-suite needs answers and Marsh & McLennan Companies is ready to provide solutions around the globe. ","We made a distinctly positive impact on the businesses, people and societies we serve by providing guidance and support during critical moments. Our competitive positioning as a trusted advisor to our clients has never been stronger. We are at the forefront of industry innovation and thought leadership around important issues such as advising in aging population how to save for retirement, managing global healthcare cost, developing and supporting client growth strategies, assisting our clients and anticipating and managing risks, navigating a new regulatory landscape in financial services and helping our clients capture opportunities in this world of risk. ","Moving to our financial results, we had an excellent fourth quarter posting our strongest organic revenue growth of the year at 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. The RIS margin rose 100 basis points to 21% and the consulting margin increased 120 basis points to 16.1%. We are proud of our strong financial and operating performance in recent years including our record of consistently higher earnings per share. Over the past five years, we have grown adjusted EPS at 14.5% CAGR and our consolidated adjusted operating margin improved almost 500 basis points. ","Let's spend a minute on our strong performance in 2014. Adjusted EPS increased 14%, adjusted operating income rose by double-digit for the seventh consecutive year and underlying revenue grew 5% with contributions from each operating company. Margin expansion occurred in both the RIS and consulting segments, reflecting the broad-based nature of our growth. This marks the fifth straight year margins have expanded in both segments. At risk and insurance service the margin rose 30 basis points in line with what we communicated throughout the year. Consulting's growth was robust, the margin increased to 160 basis points and resulted in record consulting segment operating income approaching 1 billion. It's a powerful story and there is more to the story than financial performance. ","We continue to enhance the value of Marsh & McLennan for our clients and our colleagues; we encourage innovation, creativity and challenge the status quo. We believe in the search to find the smarter way, our culture is vibrant, we're constantly building our talent with ongoing development programs, nurturing leadership capabilities and attracting the best and brightest at Marsh & McLennan. Fundamentally, our people are what set us apart. ","The progress we have made not just in 2014 but over many years is a direct result of our investments for growth. Since 2009, we have invested nearly $5 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $1.9 billion, 85 acquisitions totaling $3 billion and an increase in our headcount of over 7,600 colleagues. Our acquisition strategy is focused on growth market, not only geographically but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active last year completing 22 acquisitions and spending approximately $945 million and our pipeline remains robust. We expanded our international operations with acquisitions in Australia, Belgium, Scotland, Canada, Chile and Panama as well as in South Africa with our investment in Alexander Forbes. ","Marsh & McLennan agency had an excellent year highlighted by the acquisition of Barney & Barney which established the agency's West Coast hub as well as eight other high quality agencies throughout the country. And we were pleased to host an Investor Day last March where we updated investors on MMC's long-term operating strategies as well as capital management initiatives. We're delivering on the commitments we made at Investor Day; we committed to long-term EPS growth of 13% and delivered 14% in 2014. We committed to double-digit dividend growth and delivered 10.4%, we committed to reducing our share count and reduced shares outstanding by 7 million, we committed to allocate 2.1 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase and utilized 2.3 billion. ","For more than 140 years, we have been anticipating the changing needs of our clients as the scope challenges around risk, strategy and people grows and changes, the demand for our services should increase. We fully expect to continue to deliver on our long-term goals although this will not be without challenges. Over the past five years, we have faced a variety of macro pressures including low interest rates, weak global GDP growth and FX volatility just to name a few. We delivered each year for shareholders underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. ","In 2015, we faced even more significant headwinds from the impact of low interest rates and a strong U.S dollar. Again we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Although our EPS growth in 2015 will be below what we achieved in 2014, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at a 13% CAGR over the long-term. With that let me turn it over to Mike. ","Mike Bischoff ","Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, MMC delivered its 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and adjusted earnings per share an outstanding record of sustained performance. Revenue growth exceeded the increase and underlying operating expenses for the 17th consecutive quarter. In the quarter GAAP EPS was $0.54 and adjusted EPS rose 16%. ","Risk and insurance services had a strong finish to the year. As revenue increased to $1.7 billion rising 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 9% to $355 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 21%, the segments highest fourth quarter margin since 2003. ","Marsh's revenue was $1.5 billion increasing 4% on an underlying basis. The international division was up 5% and the U.S Canada division rose 3%. Marsh's revenue growth was driven by record new business exceeding 300 million in the quarter. New business was strong in the U.S, Canada, the UK, Peru and Africa. ","In a difficult operating environment, Guy Carpenter delivered 3% underlying revenue growth reflecting strong new business. On a geographic basis growth was led by U.S UK Facultative Asia Aviation and Marine. ","Turning to our consulting segment revenue was $1.6 billion with excellent underlying growth of 8% adjusted operating income increased 13% to $251 million and the segments market expanded a 120 balance sheet to 16.1%. Mercer\u2019s revenue increased 5% on an underlying basis to $1.1 billion with all major geographies contributing. Investments had 12% underlying revenue growth retirement grew 5%, health 4% and talent 2%. Oliver Wyman revenue reached $460 million underlying revenue growths of 15% was exceptional exceeding even our own expectations all industry's sector contributed to growth in the quarter. With geographic strength in North America and Europe.","In summary, MMC produced another strong quarter both from a revenue growth and earnings standpoint. And the results for the year were excellent as well. With strong underlying revenue growth substantial margin improvement and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. As expected, investment income was de minimis in the fourth quarter it should also be de minimis in the first quarter. As we highlighted on our last two earnings call, investment income in the last half of 2014 was expected to be offset by cooperate initiatives Additional cooperate spending in the third quarter of $13 million and $11 million in the fourth quarter essentially offset investment income over the second half of the year. Going forward, we anticipate the quarterly corporate expense should approximate 45 million. We issued $800 million of debt in September and use the proceeds in October to fund $630 million of debt obligations and cost for the early extinguishment of this debt.","We successfully utilized excess cash in 2014. This resulted in cash decreasing from $2.3 billion to $1.95 billion at year end. With $1.3 billion held internationally $332 million for nine acquisitions and investments was the cash utilized in the fourth quarter also including a $166 million for the second tranche of Mercer's investment and Alexander Forbes. ","Returning capital of these shareholders remains the priority. In the fourth quarter, we utilized $154 million for dividends and $200 million to repurchase 3.7 million shares. And for the year cash deployed included $945 million for 22 acquisitions and investments $800 million to repurchase 15.5 million shares and 583 million for dividends. Annual dividends paid per share increased 10.4% last year.","Looking ahead we remain optimistic about the underlying operating performance of our businesses. And our ability to deliver strong financial results over the long term. This year our results will be affected by macro-economic headwinds that have grown substantially in the last several months specifically the continuing decline in interest rates thus impacting our GAAP pension expense and the strengthening of the U.S.","Let me make a few observations regarding our global retirement plans. Pension accounting considers many factors in addition to the effect of discount rates and asset returns GAAP pension expense reflects projected salary increases, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and contributions. Cash contributions to our global pension plans which were $181 million in 2014 should be approximately $190 million in 2015. At the end of 2014, average interest rates used to measure our pension liabilities declined from the prior year by approximately 100 basis points not only in the U.S but throughout the world. We expect retirement expenses for MMC overall including both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The increase by approximately $125 million in 2015. We are currently implementing actions to mitigate all of this expense increase. The planned action with the greatest impact representing the substantial portion of our mitigation efforts to affect the post 65 retiree medical reimbursement program in the United States. ","This benefit was eliminated for most colleagues in 2005. As a global multi-national company we are used to dealing with foreign exchange volatility. For example FX headwinds in each of the last three years negatively impacted EPS by $0.04 to $0.05 each year. As seen from our strong financial performance over this period, we absorbed this foreign exchange headwind. The significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent months relative to the rest of the world's currencies will have a greater impact on us this year. ","We recently updated our foreign exchange forecast which covers more than 60 currencies including the pound, euro, Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. If the dollar remains where it is today, operating income will be negatively impacted by approximately 120 million or $0.15 per share, well beyond what we absorbed over the past three years. We anticipate that the magnitude of the pension and foreign exchange headwinds on a year-over-year basis is by far the greatest in the first quarter. Our efforts to offset these two macro headwinds should be the most impactful in the first quarter as well.","In conclusion, even though EPS growth this year will be below the growth of the past several years, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our 13% EPS growth target over the long-term. And with our growing cash flow, we expect to deliver double-digit dividend growth and to reduce the share account this year.","With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks Mike. And Matt, we're ready to go to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks. First, just wanted to follow up with Mike on the two major headwinds you outlined for 2015, retirement expense and impact of a strong dollar. Are you saying that the full impact that you outlined, $125 million retirement expense and $0.15 headwinds from a stronger dollar, that there will be mitigating factors to those in 2015? So it's not that full impact that will hit the bottom line?","Dan Glaser","Yes I'll take that Jay its Dan. Now what we tried to outline in our script we were saying to you that in terms of the pension expense that we are having planned actions to mitigate all of the pension expense headwind and so that's something that you don\u2019t have to consider as having an impact on us, but we did point out that foreign exchange and the dollar in particular strengthening has much more of an impact than it would typically have in a given year. I mean when we look at FX as Mike was saying over the last three years, it's been $0.04 or $0.05 negative per year. The reality is over a 10 year period, it's an absolute wash and so it has no impact either way. As the U.S. multinational that's dollar-based they then operate in 130 different countries clearly we're going to always -- FX is always going to be a part of our results, but this is a higher level than we would seek to mitigate by taking operating actions. So we do expect foreign exchange ultimately to have a negative impact on our EPS for 2015.","Jay Gelb","All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, to follow up to that, understanding that you're saying MMC is unlikely to generate the type of 14% adjusted operating EPS growth that was delivered in 2014, but you're still committed to 13% long-term -- so in terms of what that means for 2015, do you still think you can do double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year? ","Dan Glaser","I mean at the end, we don\u2019t give EPS guidance and so I don\u2019t -- really don\u2019t want to go down that path. I mean the only guidance we've given which we outlined on Investor Day last year was that we believe over a long period of time that we would deliver a CAGR of 13% a year and we still believe that. So any shareholder that is a shareholder over a long period of time, we are committing to a 13% CAGR on EPS. There's a lot of moving parts with respect to what generate EPS, it's way too early in the year for me to even have a view on that, I mean a lot has to do with top-line growth et cetera. And I would want to point also that on a constant currency basis if you looked at our business on that basis, we'd still be comfortable with saying that in 2015, we would deliver something akin to our long-term commitment of 13%.","Next question please.","Operator","I'll move for our next question from Larry Greenberg from Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg","The recent government budget proposal had some corporate tax rate suggestions. I'm just wondering what you're thinking about the tax rate prospectively. Obviously, if some of these proposals were to become law, it would certainly help. But maybe along the spectrum of where we are today to some of these potential positives coming to fruition, how you are thinking about the tax rate going forward.","Daniel Glaser","I will start with that and then I will hand it over to Mike. I do think that we've been watching the news in Washington and yes we start from the basis of -- well it doesn't appear that our tax situation can get worse as a country, so therefore we can only get better from here, so we're optimistic that that could apply. For a number of years now, we've actually been achieving double-digit adjusted EPS growth by actually improving our core business. And one of the reasons we are so focused on that not just because our leadership team is driven to achieve double-digit growth in adjusted EPS over the long-term, we also have ground to make up against many of our competitors who have tax positions which are superior to ours. So we have to develop the same kind of levels with cash flow working through operations because the U.S Tax Code is not a help. I mean specifically with regard to the U.S Tax Code our overarching view is that it needs to be competitive in order -- it needs to be reformed in order to be competitive with the rest of the world and currently it is not. So Mike you have anything to add to that?","Mike Bischoff ","Yes, thank you Dan. Obviously with regard to corporate tax for in the U.S we would be very pleased to see a lower overall corporate tax rate. However, the other thing that's very difficult for us is the U.S multinational company is bringing our international earnings back into the United States for investments and returning capital to shareholders but anything that can be done to alleviate that and help us make U.S investments and return capital to our shareholders we would certainly be in favor of. ","We do not count on reform until it's implemented and so in looking at your question on forward guidance I would point out just make a few observations -- point out a few things. First our overall tax rate has averaged 30% over the last five years and so that's probably a very on an adjusted basis and that's probably a fairly good number to model for 2015 until some legislative change occurs. We're just as in -- Scott pointed out in the fourth quarter it's lower on an adjusted basis it's about 29.5% and on a GAAP basis 27.7%. On the GAAP basis that's really due to the U.S tax treatment for the debt extinguishment. So, on a more normalized basis probably around 30%. ","Larry Greenberg","Thank you. Then I know you gave your exchange enrollee numbers after the third-quarter report. But I'm just wondering if Julio might just bring us up to date on how things were looking more towards year-end, beginning of the year, and just what's going on there.","Dan Glaser","Larry we're only going to give a formal update on the numbers once a year but having said that I am sure Julio has some color that he can add to the exchange, so Julio?","Julio Portalatin","So as we reported it back in October we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in our sane strategy, we reported north of 1 million lives that had summed up between active and Medicare and that continues to be robust in terms of pipeline that's building. Many of the clients that we had as you know in the middle market space but more importantly even for us 5,000 and above number of lives we actually doubled the amount of clients that came to us this year, last year was about 6%, this year is about 14%. So are beginning to see the edging up let's say of the type of clients that have a more volume in terms of employees. ","Now it can be said also that if you compare that to middle market larger market clients or jumbo clients have been a bit slower to make this transition over but we're beginning to see some of it got to move over until high prices of employees. And that\u2019s important because middle market clients well they continued increase we certainly want to have our share of also the jumbo market as that continues. So the pipeline is robust it's looking good for 2015. All of the numbers that we had projected in terms of number of lives per employee have come in right about what we expected, all of the savings that we also projected up to 15% are coming in right around what we expected, so, so far so good we're very excited about the prospects and continue to invest in our marketplace strategy for short, medium and long-term success. ","Operator","We will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Good morning. Thank you. First question, Dan, you mentioned that the 2014 capital management plan, that $2.3 billion exceeded the original plan, $2.1 billion. Do you have an update for 2015? ","Mike Bischoff","Yes Kai, I would say that the $2.3 billion that we committed to an utilized in 2014 it will be at least that amount in 2015. ","Kai Pan","So in term of breakdown between, like, return to shareholders and acquisition, would that -- similar to what is seen in 2014? ","Dan Glaser","Acquisition we don\u2019t budget for acquisitions. We have a pipeline and we worked the pipeline because so there could be a lot of variability with respect to acquisition. So it's a hard thing to peg right now I mean I would say and put it in the context we are committed to reducing our share account each year and we are committed to double digit increases in our dividend and so on that basis you can pretty much take what we did last year and extrapolate from there.","Kai Pan"," Then follow up on the acquisition front their recent press release that you might be interest in the UK broker. I understand you couldn\u2019t comment on specific deals. But could you talk about your acquisitions strategy as part of your global growth strategy and reach markets with particular good markets or a geographic year is to the most of your interest. ","Daniel Glaser","Sure and I'm glad you recognize that we can comment on any specific deal or any speculation that can be out there from time to time. So I'll talk a little bit about acquisitions and if Peter, Julio, Alex and Scott want to add anything then we feel free. So first of all we have a philosophy right and our philosophy meanings that there is no budget or time tables acquisitions we're focused on quality above every other factor we prefer companies that are growing faster than we are they've traded a multiple below us and where we can see that we can improve their business or they can help us by adding some capability or geography that we currently don\u2019t have. So somehow that they're going to make us better and generally we develop relationships with people highly talented people overtime and that\u2019s why it's a slow, gestating pipeline I suppose to something that\u2019s rapid. We're always as I mentioned looking at quality cultural fit consistent with our overall four pillar strategy focus on what kind of talent would be coming into the organization and how it makes us better and when all those things aligned usually economics work out. So we rarely participated in options we've been a disciplined acquirer and that maybe one of the reasons why we don\u2019t acquire all that many things compared to the numbers that we look at because we're disciplined about our approach. We're not limited by geography as you can see we've committed over the last several years most of our acquisition capital has been in the United States as we have follow through on our agency strategy in the U.S. But fundamentally we're very interested in international acquisitions and we're looking from both from geographic basis from a line of business from a capability basis all kinds of different types of companies. And so I would say that our pipeline is robust. And folks you have anything to add, Peter you want to add to that. ","Peter Zaffino","Of course very consistent with what you just said Dan its quality each companies that have a track record of growth once that have geographical compliments. And we also are a very disciplined on our segmentation strategy. We like to be patients I think that\u2019s evidence in how we pursued agencies Marsh & McLennan agency we're now entering our sixth year in the journey. But we feel very proud of the high quality agencies that we've been able to acquire. We integrate a group of best practices and so not only do we grow through acquisition we've been growing organically and have a very strong pipeline and we always are very committed to investing in business after we acquire them. So we like the SME space I can't see its expanding across the world overtime but again will be patient and try to find the right fit.","Daniel Glaser","Julio you have anything to add to that.","Julio Portalatin ","Again very supportive of Dan's comments in terms of what our umbrella is as we go after acquisitions. But you probably took notice that in 2014 we had an increase of acquisition opportunities that came versus way of course starting with the Alexander Forbes investments that we made just north of $300 million in addition to that we've made the Jeitosa Group acquisition which is significantly important to us for work day implementation in both Europe and the U.S. And we've made the strategic acquisition for HCM which is an alternative investment base that we want to expand because we opportunity there and I'm sure you see the numbers that investments management business is really growing for us. So we're going to continue and concentrate on were the growth areas are and where the opportunity for growth is. And that is our number objective right now and all the culture issues are taking care et cetera we're looking for expansion of growth opportunities geographically and within segments.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee. ","Dan Farrell ","Hi, good morning. A question on the pension costs and then the offset in the medical costs that you said. Is the medical cost offset a cash benefit? The reason I'm asking is your cash pension costs really aren't moving much at all. So it's really only on a GAAP basis that pension is moving. But I'm wondering if the offset that's helping the GAAP is a true cash benefit. ","Dan Glaser ","No it's accounting in both ways. So both the pension headwind and offset are both accounting items. ","Dan Farrell","Okay. Then just switching over to your comments at the beginning, where you really talked a lot about the difficult and challenging environment we're in globally and how that's creating a lot of work and projects for you. I am wondering with regard to the Consulting segment, particularly in Oliver Wyman. Very good organic results; tougher comparisons. But do you see an environment where you're getting increasing flow of projects and other revenues that could keep overall Consulting organic growth at a healthy level? ","Dan Glaser ","Scott, you want to take that.","Scott McDonald","Yes I'll talk a little bit about Oliver Wyman, but keep in context this is the smaller part of our consulting segment, I mean we have a good fourth quarter finishing off a strong year overall. And that was driven by pretty robust amount across sectors and across regions and in fact a little more robust than we'd expected. But we do expect consulting demand across the world to grow slightly faster than GDP in the years to come as the world remains pretty complex and we think the successful top-tier firms will grow faster than that as they take share from others and we're squarely in that group, so we expect to grow faster than that. I think the numbers we grew out in 2014, again we wouldn\u2019t expect to see that in 2015 and the best guidance I can give there is still mid to high single-digit growth rates for our business.","Dan Glaser ","Sure, next question operator.","Operator","We'll go to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I was hoping to spend a little bit more time just going back to the capital plan and your outlook. Does that assume -- take into account potentially taking on any more leverage during the year? And then can you just update us on your view on just more long-term how much leverage you would potentially look to add? ","Dan Glaser ","Sure I'll start with that and then I'll hand over to Mike. Clearly and as we discussed at Investor Day and after Investor Day our view overtime is to reduce the cash on the balance sheet somewhat and increase our overall level of leverage as well and put that extra amount of money to work and so if you look at year-end 2014 versus year-end 2013 we increased our debt by 433 million and we reduced our cash by 362 million and so that's part of a strategy and so I think you'll see that on an ongoing basis and emphasis on reducing cash on the balance sheet and increasing our overall level of leverage but Mike what would you add to that.","Mike Bischoff","Yes Dan I probably can't add too much but just to start with premise, it's nice that we have four operating companies that generate increasing amounts of not only revenue and earnings but cash flow, so it's a very nice position to be in as a Chief Financial Officer to work with my colleagues in these operation. So the first premise is that we expect our operating cash flow to go up in that regard. Dan I would completely agree with you, we used about 350 million of excess cash that was on our balance sheet. We're certainly going to try and do that probably in the same magnitude this year, limited a bit to what international acquisitions we may see and our ability as I mentioned earlier to bring cash back -- international cash back into the U.S. in a tax efficient manner, so in that regard we're looking to fairly robust year in 2015 above what we did in 2014.","Dan Glaser ","Any other question, Elyse?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, thank you. If we could also just flip and talk a little bit about what you are seeing at Guy Carpenter. I know the growth has been steady towards the end of the year. We've continued to see growth there even while we continue to talk about headwinds in the reinsurance pricing environment, which we've heard intensified during the January 1 renewals. If you can just comment on what you are seeing there, and just a little bit about your outlook for 2015. Thank you. ","Dan Glaser ","Sure, Alex why don\u2019t you take that?","Alex Moczarski","We're really pleased with the year. But also, considering that we were flat in the first quarter, to be able to end up with 2% underlying growth for the year is good but it's now been six years where we haven\u2019t had a single quarter that's been negative just one flat the rest good. So we're leaning forward and I'm really proud of the team and what they do that in respect. The fourth quarter from a point of view of rating not terribly important because we don\u2019t have a lot of renewals there we had high retention and good new business and our outlook for 2015 is somewhere between slight and moderate growth as we continue to have a good pipeline of new business and retention rates are high, due to, I believe good service and innovation.","Dan Glaser ","Thanks Alex, next question operator.","Operator","We'll go to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. I'm to follow up on that topic. Is there any direct or indirect benefit from the recently increased amount of consolidation that we are seeing in insurance and reinsurance?","Dan Glaser ","Yes I mean I'll just take that I mean at the end of the day the consolidation in both insurance, reinsurance and insurance broking is really a 25 year story and so there's been new capital formation, there's been consolidation and that's kind of story continues. We exist to serve our clients and so having a robust competitive market with a lot of choices is good for our clients and good for both Marsh and Guy Carpenter and even with the recent consolidations and announce consolidation, there is a significant level of competition in the insurance industry at multiple levels and multiple fronts. And so I don't there has been any direct or indirect impact on our business as a result nor do we plan for there to be impacts as a result of consolidation in the insurance sector. ","Meyer Shields","Okay. And I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the risk and insurance organic growth in Latin America?","Dan Glaser","First of all it's really a Marsh question I suppose to a broader risk and insurance services question because they don't specifically outline Carpenter on a Latin America basis. Latin America is one of our strongest growth regions and has been for quite a period of time as a company -- as a full company. One of the reasons why if you look at our acquisition strategy and then look at 2014, we made acquisitions in Peru, Panama and the Dominican Republic, so we're absolutely committed to Latin America as a region and we see it as having tremendous growth potentials in the future. Peter you want to take the specific question. ","Peter Zaffino","Yes, sure thanks Dan. So we had underlying growth of 3% and it certainly is not reflecting its historic growth rates on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But there is a few things that happened in the quarter, so I will try to give a little bit more detail. One is we had a challenging comparable from the prior fourth quarter which had 13% growth, we had some one-time items from prior year acquisitions that didn't repeat in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had significant non-recurring business so some of the really strong business we saw in 2013 did not recur and we're seeing some impact from the economic slowdown. But as Dan said if you take a look at the full year we had 10% growth it's going to be lumpy from time to time if you look at even international we had 5% organic growth, if you look at each quarter there have been different parts of international that have contributed 130 countries and so we think it is very well balanced, it's a major contributor to what's in terms of top-line organic growth as a percentage basis but just putting context it's about 7% of Marsh's total revenue. ","Operator","We will go next to Chris Cliff Gallant, Nomura.","Cliff Gallant","Thanks for taking the question. Mike I was wondering you mentioned that I believe in talking about the pension calculations that globally you are assuming an interest rate that's down a 100 basis points now and I was wondering on an absolute basis what that number is today?","Mike Bischoff ","Okay, thank you, yes we're not assuming it is actually based upon where interest rates are at the end of 2014 which is used for the measurement for pension going forward. And just an example the discount rate was roughly 5.3% at the end of '13 in the U.S, it was 4.3% at the end of '14. In the UK it was 4.6% at the end of '13 and about 3.65% at the end of '14; those are the two largest plans. But if we look at it throughout the world it was unusual that in almost every geography we dealt in whether it was Canada, Ireland or what have you interest rates across the maturity ladder that you use for pensions which is more mid to longer-term were down a 100 basis points. ","Cliff Gallant","Okay. That makes sense. The second question I had was just on the -- when I look at the brokerage margin for the full year, the 22.4% -- very good number and improvement over the year. If we were to set aside the impact of some of the macro things like interest rates and foreign exchange, I was curious: how would mix change affect that number as we go forward? In terms of where you're growing, where you're not, and so forth. ","Dan Glaser","Well let me just take the question broadly as the margin question. As we've said couple of times before well margins improve in our organization as an outcome of us growing revenue at a faster rate than we grow expense. We're most focused on revenue growth and organic revenue growth in particular and increasing our earnings. And the margin improvement sort of comes a little bit further down on the Hit Parade. Having said that for both RIS in the quarter up a 100 basis points and consulting up 120 bps and MMC for the quarter being up 70 bps points and for the year being up 70 bps we're very pleased with that performance, we think it's strong margin performance and our 7th straight year of margin improvements and the 5th straight year that our margins were up in both segments. And so we feel very good about our margins and I just want to say that on a going forward basis and in particular for 2015 we believe we can improve our margins notwithstanding the headwinds that we're facing, we believe that we will improve our margins in 2015 in both segments. ","Operator","We will go next to Vinay Misquith with ISI. ","Vinay Misquith","The first question is on pensions, just wanted to clarify that there is no impact on cash paid for pensions.","Mike Bischoff","It is a very limited impact on cash not material to the organization. I think that\u2019s $9 million or $10 million.","Dan Glaser","I indicated it in 2014 our contributions into the pension plans were roughly 180 million and we're expecting this year for it to be roughly 190 million.","Vinay Misquith ","Okay. What level of interest rates should we see that would take the contributions higher?","Dan Glaser","What we are going to do is the pension issue of one year at a time. I'm hoping that\u2019s it sort of that you have seven years of fam and seven years of fees to them ready for my interest fees at some point. So bear in mind what generally when something a headwind for you and is macro it can turn around and become a tail wind and it could last for a long period of time. And so obviously the many analysts how are much more experts and I for several year have been predicting movement towards higher interest rate. And there is been significant amount of macro factors that have inhibited that move. But ultimately we feel over time that interest rates over several years are more likely to higher than lower. But Mike you have anything to add.","Mike Bischoff ","And Dan I would start with you\u2019re the same promise that you did which is we will only deal with it year by year. But as I said there is many factors that go into the issues with regards to not only pension expense but with regards to funding requirements and one of the main things is our assets and however assets done. And the nice thing that our asset performance last year was very substantial growing not only in the U.S but very strongly in the UK and around the world. And so we had very good asset performance. So not withstanding that what happens is the liability goes up with regards to interest rates most at the end of the year which we think to some extent is transitory of course many firms now six years and over a low interest rate environment would use the word transitory. I wonder what deterioration of that would be. But that said is really with regards to the asset level and the performance. But based upon what we're seeing today we're not anticipating a more change in our cash contribution into the pension plans but as Dan said we'll take it year by year.","Operator","We'll go to Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.","Thomas Mitchell ","My first question is -- I think it would probably be for Scott. And that is, there's been a tremendous amount of turmoil in the European banking sector over the last number of years but more recently -- the Italians are apparently going to reorganize totally and so forth. Is that something that either represents an opportunity or has already represented a significant opportunity for the Consulting side? And if it has, how does it look from here? ","Dan Glaser","Well you're right Tom that is probably on the consulting side geared more to Scott then to Julio, Scott you want to take that question.","Scott McDonald ","Yes I guess I just make a couple of points some. But the first is I mean I think there will be continued restructuring in the European banking sector and hopefully as they strength in each of the domestic and overall regional banking markets that will help support some growth in the Europe in the future. I think it has already represented a significant opportunity for us because we do work with the private and public sector and we've been heavily involved in the restructuring of the industry. And it will continue to represent a significant opportunity for us in the future. I don\u2019t expect that to change for a number of years. So this is going to take a long time to restructure the sector.","Thomas Mitchell ","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Then a separate kind of follow-up is that -- is there something not similar to that at all, but separately are you seeing interest in the US banking sector -- either coming from foreign interest or domestic -- that would indicate an increase in either restructuring or M&A activity? ","Dan Glaser","The U.S is a little different in Europe and they restructured earlier in the crisis and it's a more stable system now I think with less solvency and capital issues. But it's a factor that has most of you on the call no enormous growth challenges in the years ahead. So I think there will be it won't be what necessary in Europe which is wholesale restructuring of the banking sector. But here there is got to be refinement for the banking model and that could involve people from outside the U.S or from inside the U.S but it also represents a pretty big opportunity for us.","Operator","We'll go to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. ","Paul Newsome ","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to know if we've seen any changes in the structure of contingent commissions recently, under the thesis that typically when you start to see a softer market those structures change in terms of what they reward, whether it be profit-sharing versus growth versus new products. Any changes that you've seen yet? ","Dan Glaser ","I'll speak broadly and then hand over to Peter. I would look at this subject more broadly as carrier revenue streams. And there's always certain parts of our company where we actually earn contingent commission, but clearly there's carrier revenue streams for all brokers in multiple countries. The most important thing around carrier revenue streams is principles around them of putting clients' interest first and being transparent, so Peter you have something to add.","Peter Zaffino","Yes Dan there has not been much change in terms of the question on contingents or insurer revenue. As you said, we have been working very hard at Marsh to lead the industry in transparency and disclosure, and avoid business practices that have conflicts of interest. So we have not seen any increases or demands of changing how insurer revenue remunerates brokers.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Paul any other question?","Paul Newsome ","Almost an accounting question. Does it matter financially with any of your debt covenants or anything in regard the book value impact of pension and FX that runs through, versus the cash and the GAAP EPS impact? ","Dan Glaser","We'll follow it up to make sure we give you a precise answer with Keith, but nothing that I'm aware of.","Next question operator.","Operator","And we'll go to Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Mike Nannizzi","Thank you. Just one question; most of my questions were answered. But the Investments Consulting business within Mercer, that's been growing, underlying double digit for some time now. Can you talk about: what is your expectation there? What's driving that? Is it some of the pension items, or something else that we just generally see in the market? How should we be thinking about that line? Thanks. ","Dan Glaser","Sure, so Julio.","Julio Portalatin","Growth this quarter for investments was driven by new money from clients' wins and market performance for greater regulatory oversight and governance requirement it also led to increased demand for de-risking advice, insurance company buyout solutions and implementation advice. So we did cross the 100 billion mark of assets under management in the third quarter and we ended the year over 115 billion in assets under management, so the equity market obviously also help us as some of that is on a fee-based and in relation to the performance, but I will also say that we monitor that very carefully so we can control volatility and much of our growth also comes on a fix-fee basis. ","And we have a pretty robust investment business across the globe, it's not just in the U.S. right it's about one-third of it that actually ends up being our financial services business in Australia, about one-third of it is investment consultancy which is mostly in the U.S. and Europe and then we have the investment management business which you're referring to onto the assets under management. So we continue to have a pretty robust growth trajectory there, good mix in business growing with great ambition for the future, we'll continue to invest as well.","Dan Glaser","Mike, any other question?","Mike Nannizzi","Thanks. Yes, so just one follow-up, Dan, I guess, on the capital management front. The one thing I remember you mentioned from Investor Day -- I thought it was a very earnest comment about you're an operator, you've come into the role of CEO, and thinking about deployment and managing capital and using earnings, buybacks relative to earnings. Now the one thing where Marsh is very different than others is very high interest coverage, very, very low leverage. That clearly is a lever. Is that something that may be an evolution as well, as you think about managing for optimization? Maybe, at what point -- and maybe you are already; I'm sure the conversation is happening. But just trying to get an understanding of that. Because it certainly is an outlier relative to others. Thanks. ","Dan Glaser","Yes, sure. Most leaders are outliers on one basis to another you don\u2019t get to be great by following a path and so we do set our own path at Marsh & McLennan and part of that path is we're a balanced organization when you look at our return of capital to shareholders it's via acquisitions and growing our company for the betterment of shareholders and clients and colleagues overtime through repurchases and through dividends and so you will see us deploying more levels of capital and as Mike indicated the 2.3 billion that we did last year will almost certainly be higher in 2015 than it was in 2014 so we're very much committed to returning capital to shareholders and but also a very balanced organization in terms of our strategy and our thinking of the ways that we return that capital so I'd hope that answers your question Mike.","Operator I think that might actually do it and let's -- we could take one more question I think other than that I think the conference should be over.","Operator","And so we do have a follow-up question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks for the color, just on the FX being most impactful in the first quarter. It seems intuitive that it would almost be like a straight-line projection downward in terms of how impactful it will be over the course of 2015. Is that a fair assumption?","Daniel Glaser","No it's not because it really is a mix of business issue. As an example if you look at RIS some of the European renewals happened in January and January 1 is the biggest date of the year in Continental Europe, June 30th is the biggest date of the year in Australia and so it does vary on that basis although the largest portion of the impact would happen in the first quarter. But Mike do you have something to add. ","Mike Bischoff ","Yes just had additional color as Dan said approximately half of the impact will be felt in the first quarter for the reasons that Dan articulated. And then if you look at over the course of the entire year whereas risk and insurance services will feel it most dramatically in the first quarter, over a course of entire year consulting will feel it a little bit more than risk and insurance services. So we will get through the big year-over-year headwind in the first quarter and then it will tail off a bit but it will still be fairly robust against us but like I said about half of it in the first quarter. ","Dan Glaser","And operator and all those on the call thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I just want to reaffirm that I am tremendously optimistic about our future, our core operations are very strong, I feel privileged to lead this great company and I would like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Thank you. ","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Second quarter 2014 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at www.mmc.com.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you the remarks made today may include statements relating to future events or results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.

Glaser","Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino, Alex Moczarski, Julio Portalatin and Scott McDonald. Also with us this morning is Keith Walsh.","MMC continued to deliver excellent financial results in the second quarter. We produced strong revenue growth, meaningful margin improvement and double-digit growth in operating income. We also returned capital to shareholders through increased share repurchase and announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend.","MMC's revenue growth was 7%, with all operating companies contributing. This level of growth was achieved both organically and through our strategy of executing on quality acquisitions. Revenue grew 5% on an underlying basis. This growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses as it has for 15 consecutive quarters, driving our consolidated adjusted margin of 60 basis points to 19.8%, our highest second quarter in a decade.","Adjusted operating income rose 11%. This is the fourth straight year that we increased second quarter earnings by double digits.","Looking at our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue increased 6% to $1.8 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $454 million. The second quarter margin declined slightly to 25.4%. But more importantly, during the first half of the year, the margin increased 20 basis points to 26.3%.","For the full year, Risk and Insurance Services remains on track to produce solid underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth as well as deliver slight margin improvement driven by Marsh.","Marsh's revenue increased 7% to $1.5 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. All major geographic regions contributed to the strong underlying growth in the quarter. The International division increased 5% as revenue continued to expand throughout Marsh's vast geographic footprint. Latin America, with superb growth of 16%, reported its 7th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Asia Pacific also continued to generate strong growth, rising 9%; EMEA grew 1% in the quarter. In the U.S.\/Canada division, underlying growth was 3%. Marsh's revenue growth is driven by strong new business growth in Canada, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as high client retention across the organization. Marsh continues to identify opportunities to enhance global growth through acquisitions.","Marsh & McLennan Agency added the largest independent insurance agency in North Carolina. Also in the quarter, we closed 2 other acquisitions in Marsh & McLennan Agency and reached an agreement to acquire a majority stake in Marsh's long-standing correspondent broker in Panama.","Guy Carpenter delivered 2% underlying revenue growth in the second quarter despite ongoing rate reductions in many lines. New business wins and penetration beyond our larger clients drove higher revenue in the quarter. While the U.S., Guy Carpenter's largest geography, was essentially flat, revenue growth was driven by international operations reflecting increases in the U.K. Treaty, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Continental Europe.","In the Consulting segment, revenue increased 8% to $1.5 billion or 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income reached $247 million, an increase of 20% from the prior year. And this segment's margin increased 160 basis points to 16.2%, the best in over 20 years.","Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion or 2% on an underlying basis. This increase was spread across all major regions with particular strength from the U.S. and Mercer's growth markets. When viewed by line of business, growth was driven by Investments, which increased 6%; and by Health, up 4%.","In June, Mercer announced that it would acquire a 34% stake in South Africa-based Alexander Forbes, a leader in the retirement, investments and employee benefits space in South Africa and broader sub-Saharan Africa. The Alexander Forbes initial public offering was completed last week. This investment is consistent with our strategy of seeking quality businesses with a strong operational and cultural fit that provide geographic expansion opportunities in fast-growing markets. We have a close relationship with the Alexander Forbes management team. You might recall, we purchased its risk and insurance broking operation 2.5 years ago.","Oliver Wyman's revenue in the second quarter reached a record $449 million, reflecting outstanding underlying growth of 17%. The results reflect substantial growth in Oliver Wyman's largest practice, Financial Services, and strong growth from consumer and Lippincott. We are very pleased with Oliver Wyman's first half underlying revenue growth of 14%. In the second half of the year, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to moderate.","In summary, our excellent second quarter and year-to-date results are consistent with our 2014 business plan. And we remain well positioned to deliver on the long-term goals we committed to at Investor Day: growth in revenue, long-term EPS growth of 13%, increasing cash flows and return of capital to shareholders through reducing share count and double-digit dividend growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, revenue increased 7% to $3.3 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $656 million, the highest level of second quarter profitability in our history. The consolidated adjusted margin rose from 19.2% to 19.8%. GAAP EPS increased 12% to $0.77, and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $0.79.","As we highlighted on last quarter's call, we anticipated that this quarter would be impacted by a meaningful reduction in investment income and, within the Risk and Insurance Services segment, the impact of planned expense growth and the negative effects of foreign exchange. The adverse FX impact was slightly less than the $0.02 we have projected since several major currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar. In the third quarter, we expect foreign exchange to impact Risk and Insurance Services by the same magnitude as this quarter.","Investment income. We had an investment loss of $2 million this quarter compared with investment income of $23 million in the prior year, a reduction of $0.03 per share on a year-over-year basis. For modeling purposes, we'd like you to note that any investment income from Trident III that may occur in the last half of this year will most likely be offset by corporate initiatives. As you may recall, income from Trident III only represents our general partner carried interest. And the timing of this we do not control.","In the second quarter, MMC issued $600 million of 3.5% 10-year senior notes. This allowed us to fund the July debt maturity of $320 million. By refinancing at attractive interest rates, the average cost of our debt has declined 60 basis points over the past year.","Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the second quarter. As you know, the tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, reflecting our geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and the impact of changes in international and\/or state tax rates. For example, in the second quarter, we completed the federal tax audit with the IRS for the 2012 tax year. Since we expect our tax rate to be approximately 30% for the remainder of this year, the effective tax rate for the full year should be around 29.5%.","Our 34% interest investment in Alexander Forbes will cost $312 million. This investment will occur in 2 tranches, with approximately 15% completed last week and the remaining 19% subject to normal regulatory approvals, which should occur during the third quarter.","Consistent with the guidance we offered at Investor Day, CapEx for this year is trending at about $400 million, with $202 million spent year-to-date. Approximately 2\/3 of this spend relates to technology and systems and about 1\/3 is for real estate. These investments are enhancing growth, improving efficiency, expanding client and colleague capabilities and reducing real estate cost as we consolidate office locations when leases expire. We follow a balanced capital management philosophy: reinvestment in each of our businesses for growth and return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Cash was $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, consisting of $1.66 billion held internationally and $340 million in the United States. Cash utilized in the second quarter included $138 million for dividends, $72 million for 3 acquisitions and $250 million to repurchase 5 million shares of our stock. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of share buybacks.","For the first 6 months of this year, we have deployed over $1 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. As we communicated at Investor Day, we plan to grow both organically and through quality acquisitions. We will consistently return excess capital to shareholders, both through double-digit growth in dividends and meaningful share repurchase. We're committed to reducing our share count year-after-year.","Overall, looking at both our financial and operating performance, a very strong first half of the year. Looking forward, we expect adjusted EPS growth in the second half of the year to exceed the 10% growth we reported in the first 6 months. We are on target to deliver strong EPS growth for the full year.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Mike. Jamie, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping that we could spend more time talking about what you are seeing at Guy Carpenter. I mean, the growth did stand out in the quarter, especially in light of the market commentary that we're hearing in terms of prices down double digits. If you can comment on what you saw price-wise during the recent June and July renewals. And also, your expectations for the balance of the year, if you expect that you can kind of sustain that 2% growth level? Or what we might see in the back half of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So thank you, Elyse. It's Dan here, and I'll just kick off some commentary on the market in general. I think it's important to know that everyone I have sitting around this table is a seasoned hand in the risk and insurance services space. And from that perspective, we operate over many, many years in all kinds of markets. And usually, the risk and insurance services market, for one reason or another, is usually softer, softening, and so we're quite used to the idea that the market is competitive and that there's downward pressure on rates. And so Guy Carpenter has done a good job anticipating the future, really starting many quarters ago. And so, Alex, do you want to dig in a little deeper?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Sure. Thank you very much. So yes, echoing what Dan has said, we've been -- it's now 5.5 years where we haven't gone backwards in any quarter. So 22 quarters without going backwards, which I think is a testament to the strength of the management and the people that we have within the company and our relationships with our clients. And as we've said in Investor Day, we've continued to look at bringing new products, new services into our portfolio. And we've also executed on segmentation, which we talked about. So we're widening our net. We have many more smaller clients than we had before. We've invested in people. We've actually increased our headcount probably around 140 people over the last year or so. Many of those are what we call strategic hires that relate to bringing in new business. Others are based on bringing in new services around our strategic advisory. Others are related to acquisitions that we've made in what we consider to be growth areas, like Accident and Health and Agriculture. And then finally, we have been able to bring in some very good people to look after the increased client base that we have because we have many more clients. So yes, rates have been coming down. But it's interesting because some companies have found that the contingent capital is very interesting. They're actually changing that strategy around buying reinsurance. Others are using some of their budget now to buy casualty reinsurance. So it's not a tale of woe, it's just -- it's around execution. It's around client relationships. It's around leaning forward. It's around investing. And I think we'll be able to show modest growth, mild growth for the rest of the year.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Alex. So Elyse, just to summarize that, it's -- it won't be a banner top line year for Guy Carpenter, but we do expect to see growth over the entire year.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one other, in terms of RIS just looking at the overall margins, you guys did say about modest margin improvement for the full year. I think you used the word slight in your prepared remarks.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Now has that changed from where you were sitting last quarter? I know you guys pointed to some negative impacts from foreign exchange, as well as the expense growth in the second quarter. But when you're looking at the back half of the year, has your expectations changed? Or is that kind of similar to where we were sitting a few months ago?","Daniel S. Glaser","It's very similar to where we were a few months ago. So nothing's really changed on that front. I mean, let me just address RIS margins in general because our view is we will continue to expand margins over time, while we invest for future growth. The level of margin improvement is going to move around and vary a bit based upon where the top line is and the pace of our investments, which can be lumpy from time to time. This year, in particular, we expect good revenue and good earnings growth in RIS but slight margin expansion for the year.","J. Michael Bischoff","And I would just add on our foreign exchange modeling. Obviously, the currencies can move dramatically across the dollar. But from the beginning of the year, we essentially gave guidance, and then we updated that guidance in the first quarter earnings call. It really did not change. And as I just indicated, our current modeling, despite marked movements in the euro and the pound, still indicates that the second and third quarters will feel the most negative impact for RIS. And in fact, every quarter, RIS, most likely, will feel foreign exchange negative impacts. So our view on the impact of foreign exchange has not changed. I would also point out that the -- just seasonally, the third quarter is the smallest for RIS, so foreign exchange may impact it slightly more in the third quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the second. But just to reiterate what Dan said, no, our view has not changed at all.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, if I recall correctly, last quarter and the Investor Day, you have reiterated that you have more of a focus on profit growth in Risk and Insurance Services than margin expansion. I just want to see if that's still the case.","Daniel S. Glaser","That's absolutely right. I mean, when I -- to be frank, I don't spend 5 minutes worrying about our margins or our ability to expand margins in the future. And when I look at our raw absolute margins in RIS, even though they were down 20 bps, they were up 170 bps in the second quarter of 2013, and they're up 20 bps through the 6 months this year. And then when I look at just the absolute amount, 25.4% through 6 months, in my mind, is very competitive in the marketplace. And so it's really about how do we take this terrific business and grow it faster both on the top line and on earnings while maintaining and improving our margins over time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then on Guy Carpenter, unlike one of your major competitors that saw a pullback in organic growth in reinsurance brokerage, Guy Carpenter actually accelerated versus the first quarter. It will be helpful to get some color on that maybe from Alex. Was that account wins? Was that some other factor that helped drive growth to a better level?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Yes, we had very good new business. And that's -- again, that's part of 2 things, really. It's the segmentation strategy, it's focusing to get the right products to the right type of clients and going into areas where we -- perhaps, we had some business, but we didn't realize how strong it was, and so we've created a segment around it, and we've focused people on it. That's been very effective. And our retention has been good as far as clients. We haven't lost -- no, I don't -- I could name maybe one that we've lost in the last quarter. So all in all, good retention, good new business and selling new product.","Daniel S. Glaser","And then I think it's important to reiterate, Jay, what Alex had said earlier as well, that even though this is a slow growth environment for Guy Carpenter, we believe Guy Carpenter is absolutely one of the jewels in our crown. And we are continuing to invest. Guy Carpenter, over the last several years, it's been our fastest grower, they're competitive in the market, they've got a great leadership team, and in many ways, they've become the employer of choice. And so from our basis, we're continuing to grow the top line. The numbers that -- the headcount, the numbers that Alex had referred to earlier in the call when he was talking about more than 100 different hires, that represents 6% or so of Guy Carpenter's headcount. So you can see, in the last 12 months, we've made a bet on Guy Carpenter and the reissuance business in general.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess just one question. You mentioned revenue growth outpacing expense growth overall. Can we talk -- drill down maybe a bit into the Risk segment, where it looks like maybe that hasn't been the case here. Recently, I know you mentioned some expense initiatives. We'd love to sort of understand those and just sort of get an idea of what's happening to natural margins, excluding these types of initiatives. And if those are still on pace to deliver the same type of performance that you sort of talked about across the whole book.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. I mean, in the RIS segment, when I look over the last, really, 5 years or even slightly longer, virtually, in every quarter, revenue growth for RIS exceeds expense growth. That's a discipline of the company. It's a philosophy of the entire firm, and it's how we operate the business. And so it is not that we intend for that to reverse. Sure, there may be the odd quarter here or there where we get upside down. But believe me, we won't stay upside down. Now if I look on the expense side for the whole company, including RIS, we've been operating in a managed expense environment all the way through the financial crisis and its aftermath. And so if you look at the last 8 quarters, our expense growth this quarter at 3%, it's actually the highest expense growth we've had in the last 8 quarters. But certainly, 3% is not a worrying trend to us from that standpoint. And we expect RIS to continue to invest as they see necessary in order to generate future growth.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the Consulting side, would it be possible to understand what sort of happened to Mercer margins year-over-year and what happened to Oliver Wyman, where -- can we -- should we make the assumption that in each of those subsegments that margins were flat? It's just a larger share of the total pie that Oliver Wyman earned this year?","Daniel S. Glaser","I mean, I would look at a couple of things on this basis. First of all, the margins are far from flat in our Consulting segment. I mean, the overall segment was up 160 basis points in the quarter, and that's on top of 120 basis points in the second quarter of last year. The 16.2% margin in the quarter, the highest quarter that we've had in our recognition but certainly over the last 20 years. So there's been tremendous margin expansion in the Consulting segment not only last year, but we've got growth-on-growth this year. And both -- Oliver Wyman, we don't break out our margins by operating company because it is a Consulting segment, but I can say, Oliver Wyman and Mercer have both contributed to the margin expansion within Consulting.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, on the tax rate. It looks like it declined a bit year-over-year. Maybe some thoughts on that. And generally, like how do you think about taxes relative to your peers? And is that something that you want to address or where that you feel like you're comfortable where you are?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, Mike, do you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, I'd be more than happy to. And Jay, you're absolutely correct. Tax is a fairly complex topic. With regard to our peers, I won't comment too much on that. Obviously, we have peers that we're competing against that have a tax rate higher than we do, and we have peers that have a tax rate lower than we do. So we really do focus on what we can do and how we can manage it. I would say one thing is different than when we reported it in the second half of last -- in the second quarter of last year. In the second quarter of last year, we had given guidance to the investment community that our tax rate would be about 30% for the entire year. And over the course of the first 6 months, the tax rate was trending slightly lower than that. And we still said that it should be about 30% for the entire year. It's different this year. It's different this year in that we did have some discrete items. I did mention the larger one, which is that we completed the open year of 2012 with regard to our federal return with the IRS. And so our tax rate for the first half of the year was below the 30%. But as you could hear in my prepared remarks, we don't think we'll give any of that back. And so we're hopeful that our tax rate over the last 6 months would be 30%. So our effective tax rate will be 29.5%. That's the -- for the year. And that's the lowest that we've seen in many years, so we're encouraged by that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So first question is on buybacks. It looks like you -- today, you said you're going to a capital management plan for this year $2.1 billion, including $800 million acquisitions; $600 million for dividends. About -- that leave about $700 million for buybacks. You did $400 million, so just in the first half. So I just wonder, is that math indicate that in the second half you're going to slow down? And also related to your cash balance in the U.S., $340 million, will that be the limiting factor how much you can -- how quickly you can buy back your shares?","J. Michael Bischoff","Excuse me, this is Mike Bischoff. I just want to get the math correct. We did $350 million of share repurchase in the first 6 months. We did $100 million in the first quarter and $250 million in the second quarter.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm sorry. My bad. My math is bad.","J. Michael Bischoff","Sure.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So basically, you're looking for about the same pace then in the second half?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, yes. I mean, but -- and the thing is what we outlined on Investor Day in terms of that $2.1 billion and sort of the, let's say, the hold we had with regard to our expectations around acquisitions, leaving $1.3 billion or so available for dividends and share repurchase, that's as good a number as any for you to use right now. I mean, it certainly, in our expectation, won't be less than that amount.","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes. Just to add clarity to that so there's no ambiguity. We are fairly clear on Investor Day. We were indicating that return of capital to shareholders would be about $1.3 billion. That would be comprised of dividends and share repurchase. Tracking through the first 6 months, dividends were $275 million, and shares, as I mentioned, were $350 million. You're absolutely right that Dan, in -- at Investor Day, indicated that we had kind of allocated in our own thinking about $800 million for acquisitions over the course of the year. Nice to report that our pipeline has been very robust. Our acquisitions through the first 6 months were $439 million. With the investment that you just heard us describe in Alexander Forbes, that's another $312 million. So we're roughly $750 million already against that $800 million that Dan articulated in Investor Day. So in every category, we're not only tracking but feel very good with regard to what we articulated at Investor Day.","Daniel S. Glaser","And thanks, Kai, because it really is a good question. And like we said at Investor Day, even if we go over our placeholder of $800 million, we don't expect that, that would impact the $1.3 billion that we're thinking about in terms of share repurchase and dividend.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Then secondly, can you give update on the private health exchange and what the pipeline looks like, and especially going into the second half, probably the peak of the enrollment season?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Julio, do you want to take that?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, Kai for the question. Last time, we updated the numbers at Investor Day. We said around 300,000 lives or so spread across about 80 clients. And we have -- that included both the active and the retiree space. Our sales process continues very aggressively. Our pipeline is very, very strong. The selling season is at its height. And we continue to have clients who are choosing the platform, and they will sign up as of the first of the year 2015 and then throughout the year as well because, as you know, we have a lot of middle-market clients that have different enrollment dates. So it's great to be able to pace that throughout the year. And as we said in the last call, we plan on updating sales activity in lives as we get through the third quarter and early fourth quarter. And it's going to be, I think, a very good outcome for us. The -- I can say the activity has been stronger. We're very, very pleased. We think it's best to give that update towards the end of the year, when the full picture is well known, and the sales season is complete. But I have to tell you, the level of dialogue we're having with our clients and prospects around these changes is very high, and we're just very pleased with how it's going. And stay tuned for the announcements, I guess, later on.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just to nitpick a little bit more on margins, you mentioned FX about the same in 3Q as 2Q. When we think about expense comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, I mean, is there any unevenness to those quarters in comparison with the year ago?","Daniel S. Glaser","No, I think what Mike was alluding to is, particularly in RIS, the third quarter is our smallest revenue quarter. And so expenses, some of which are straight line throughout the year, tend to look a little bit higher. We always have our lowest margins in the third quarter, and that's been the case for many, many years. And so that -- but there's nothing that is anticipated which is changing the trajectory. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're expecting a better second half of the year from an earnings growth standpoint.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Right. Good. That's helpful. And then can you just elaborate a little bit more on the acquisitions that you've made, including Alexander Forbes? And just what that brings to you guys either strategically or geographically?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So I'll take that to start with, Larry, and then I'll hand off to Peter in the first instance to talk about some of Marsh & McLennan Agency because that's really been a focus for us over the last number of years in terms of acquisition strategy and philosophy. And then we'll hand over to Julio, who will specifically talk about Alexander Forbes and how thrilled we are to be the anchor investor on their recent IPO. Let me just say, just to begin with and reiterating some of the thoughts that we had on Investor Day, acquisitions have really been a core part of our strategy and philosophy over many years. We developed relationships over a long period of time. And frankly, when we do acquisitions, more times than not, it's both sides thinking, hey, we'll be better together than we are apart, so why don't we get together? I mean, our focus is certainly on the 4 pillars that we always outlined to you, but also talent, quality, cultural fit, economics. And we generally prefer companies that are growing faster than we are or trading below our multiple or where we see the business and we believe we can improve the business and improve its margins. So Peter, do you want to talk a little bit about MMA?","Peter Zaffino","Sure, Dan. Thanks. Well, MMA is a very consistent story, continues to drive organic growth. We've done 39 acquisitions since 2009, and our annualized revenue is closing in at around $650 million. We did 3 acquisitions in the second quarter. Dan mentioned in his opening comments one in North Carolina, the largest independent agency, Senn Dunn, which has a real balanced property and casualty employee benefits portfolio mix. And it's really becoming a core differentiator for us in the United States. If I could add one thing before handing it over to Julio is that the Alexander Forbes insurance acquisition has proven to be incredibly valuable for Marsh, giving us a footprint in sub-Sahara Africa. It's been a strong contributor in connecting our multinational clients, and so that has been a real differentiation for Marsh. And it's contributing to organic growth in the EMEA region.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, so we've really been quite active in Marsh, not only in MMA but also Africa, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic. Julio, do you want to talk about Alexander Forbes?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks, Dan and Peter. For quite some time now, we've been articulating a strategy to want to become much more significant in the growth market economies around the world, and this is obviously a further step in that direction. Through this investment, we gain great exposure to a great management team, great clients and a fantastic footprint in a geography that's going to be growing certainly over the next decade. And Mercer will have a role on Alexander Forbes Board of Directors. We will contribute strategic expertise in a global perspective. We'll be supportive to African clients who want to become global outside of Africa, as well as our clients will have the benefit of a great structure inside of South Africa and sub-Sahara Africa when they're expanding into Africa. We believe that the transaction offers just some real significant value to both the client base of both sides of the transaction and also the employees and opportunities for the future. We're really pleased with this transaction. I couldn't be more excited about it, and we're looking forward to maximizing it's value as time goes on.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Julio. Does that cover it, Larry?","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, it's helpful.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a question on your international cash. Does your 30% tax rate for the balance of the year include any plans for movement of international cash over to the U.S. holding company?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, very good question. I think we generally indicated that we have about $1.4 billion of international cash going into the year dedicated on a permanently invested basis. And you can see with regard to Alexander Forbes, that's one way that we plan to utilize international cash. With regard to the U.S., yes, we do have repatriation strategies. We look at it over multiple years. As you know, the main driver of need for cash in the U.S. is for share repurchase and dividends, in addition to funding the acquisitions in the U.S., predominantly MMA. And then specifically to your question, which is does the 30% tax rate guidance for the last 6 months and 29.5% for the entire year include the repatriation of funds that we need from our international operations into the U.S. for these purposes that I just mentioned? And the answer is yes, it does.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also just a question on some of the investments that you're making in the business. Your capital expenditure has been running higher than a lot of your peers, and I was wondering if you could just maybe expand a little bit on some of the things that you're doing. And are these investments targeted towards more operational efficiency, growth efforts? Maybe just some color around them would be helpful.","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, if you say operational efficiencies, growth and reducing risk, you would have had the trifecta. So well done, Dan. The main drivers are those 3 areas, so initiatives to improve growth, to drive efficiency and reduce risk. Mike, do you want to add some color to that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, I -- once again, I won't mention our rate of CapEx compared to competitors because they may have their own needs. But with regard to us, our CapEx spending did increase fairly significantly from the levels of '09, 2010 and building up to where it was in 2013 and 2014, tracking at about $400 million. And like I've said, about 2\/3 of that is in technology for, really, IT upgrades. There's finance transformation. We have new fiduciary revenue and billing systems not only in the U.S. but introducing that in the U.K. We have data centers and client analytics. And so we really have been spending over the last several years to make MMC even stronger and more efficient with expanded client and colleague capabilities. The other roughly 30% is, as I mentioned, reducing our global real estate footprint, more efficiency, collocations, cost savings and also putting in the smart office concepts for our colleagues.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Given the growth at Oliver Wyman, has the business become seasonal in terms of revenues? And does that have any impact on exacerbating seasonality in Consulting margins?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, no, it's an interesting question. I would approach it in a couple of different ways, and then I'll hand off to Scott to give a little bit more flavor to it. First, if you look at our overall business between Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting, it's reasonably well balanced. And so from that standpoint, you don't see large seasonal shifts as we go throughout the year on the Consulting side. And as we mentioned earlier, on the RIS side, you tend to see a seasonal dip in revenue in the third quarter, and the other 3 quarters for RIS are reasonably similar to each other. You also have to bear in mind that when we look at the RIS segment, Guy Carpenter is much smaller than Marsh. And when you look at the Consulting segment, Oliver Wyman is much smaller than Mercer. And so even though Oliver Wyman may be growing much faster for a period of time, its impact on the overall numbers for -- particularly on earnings for the Consulting segment is muted just because of its size relative to Mercer. But Scott, do you want to talk about potential seasonality?","Scott McDonald","Sure. I don't think, Josh, that the seasonality has changed. In management consulting, typically, we see slower months in July and August and then in December and January as there's lower client activity in that. That's been that way for many years and hasn't changed. Specifically, the growth we're seeing now, I think, is driven by -- not by seasonality but by 3 things. The first is we had a pretty weak 2013, and so our comparison to that is excellent. It will get harder through the second half of the year as our second half of the year was better last year. The economic environment has been supportive of corporate confidence, and they've been spending money on Consulting. So that has been helpful for us. And we've made a lot of changes at Oliver Wyman over the last 18 months or 2 years around the organization and approach to market. I think we've made it a better firm, and we're being more successful in the market and that should continue. So I'd expect we'll still see strong continued growth. The seasonality won't be different than the past, but the current growth rates in the high teens are unsustainable, we think.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so when you say moderating growth -- I mean, I know you don't give specific guidance, but maybe I'm looking for a little bit. Does moderate mean high single digits? Or does that mean in line with the rest of Consulting?","Daniel S. Glaser","I would say -- and it's Dan here, speaking for Scott. I would say moderating growth means to the mid- to high single digits at least in my business plan and, hopefully, in Scott's.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Going back to Guy Carpenter, is there any dislocation in the reinsurance brokerage arena where maybe more clients than you would've expected are open to the idea of switching brokers?","Daniel S. Glaser","I'll take that to start with, and then hand over to Alex. I mean, the client retention levels in reinsurance broking in general, and certainly Guy Carpenter specifically, are extremely high and would be the envy of all of our other Opcos. I mean, the -- so the switching that you might see more often on the retail side in either consumer businesses, retail businesses is not prevalent on the reinsurance side. So this is -- so when companies switch, it's usually a multi-year relationship development. And Guy Carpenter is showing its innovative skills in creating a relationship of trust and then a movement happens. It's not a price-spaced or a point-in-time type of shift. But Alex, do you have something else to add to that?","Alexander S. Moczarski","I would say I'd echo again what you said. I'd maybe say that there's been changes in the brokerage structure within the marketplace, okay, and that's brought some changes. The other thing -- the other reason why we might get a -- lose a piece of business -- but actually, we haven't been losing -- but when a piece of business is because there's a change in management in one of the insurance companies or change in ownership. And there's been some of that going on. So -- but I don't see any major change or shift in the landscape that you might be questioning.","Daniel S. Glaser","So we have seen no secular dislocation, Meyer. Any other questions?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, just one quick one. Once you've acquired the 34% stake in Alexander Forbes, where does that impact the income statement? Is that investment income?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike, do you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes. No, actually, it will be the equity method of accounting. So it will be the earnings of Alexander Forbes. And then our proportional share, which will be 34% when we complete the tranche in this quarter. And then it will be tax affected. And then it will be added to the revenue each quarter for Mercer.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the Risk and Insurance segment. I believe you said margin expansion will be modest this year, and this was, in large part, due to the foreign exchange. Just curious, on a more normalized basis, how much of margin expansion do you expect in that segment?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. I mean, I'm not setting a margin target for the RIS segment over time. I would say that we expect our revenues in RIS to generally be exceeding our expenses in RIS as we march forward. I would also say that the margin levels in RIS are very competitive in the market, and they may actually be market leading at this stage. So our view is to focus our attention, as we mentioned at Investor Day, in growing top line revenue and also growing our earnings in this high-margin business as opposed to overly focusing on margins. Margins will -- margin expansion will be an outcome rather than a driver of our activity. Any other question?","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just in the Consulting segment, you've shown very strong margins first half of this year. Should we see a small slowdown in the pace of margin improvement in the second half?","Daniel S. Glaser","I mean, the Consulting margins have been rocketing forward over the last 2.5 years. And really, that's down to the leadership team and everyone getting behind the idea of running the business more like an overall advisory and transactional firm and less like a pure consulting firm. And so they -- we've made tremendous strides in running the business from that standpoint. We -- when we look forward over not only the back half of the year but in the future, we believe both of our segments have the ability to grow their margins. And so that is a focus of the company a little bit more so these days in Consulting than in RIS. But overall, I would say, for both segments, the primary interest of ours is growing organic revenue, followed by growing earnings and margin expansion as an outcome of us growing our revenue at a faster pace than growing our expenses.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Was curious about growth at Marsh, and I wonder if we could get any color on contribution to organic growth from Marsh Agency. I know the comment about $650 million in revenue, but as that sort of earns in and becomes organic over time, can we get some thought on how that's helping versus the traditional Marsh business?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Sure. Well, I'll just start by saying if you look at the RIS segment in total, we've had 17 consecutive quarters of 3% organic growth or better. So we're quite pleased with our growth in this tough market environment of our RIS segment. And Marsh, specifically, has had 4% growth 3 quarters in a row. So Peter and his team are doing a phenomenal job in developing organic growth in a very big company. And so Peter, do you want to give us more color?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. If I -- thanks, Dan. If I start with MMA, we look at some of the peer companies outside of the organization for middle market business, and they are performing at or above what we expect on organic growth. I mean, the U.S. and Canada division has multiple businesses in it, and therefore, it is a big contributor. But we also have the core U.S. business for brokerage. We have Canada. We have an MGA, a private client. We have a program business. We have a technology business in STARS. And they all contributed, perhaps, not all in the same quarter, but MMA has been a really steady contributor. We have been investing for organic growth as we outlined at Investor Day. And as we continue to expand our footprint, we feel we have more balance for that growth.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. I guess on another segment, saw some commentary that there's been a change in U.K. pensions, and curious if this is a U.K.-specific or company-wide and what the potential effect on expenses are on making a pension change away from a defined benefit.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So a couple of things. One, the U.K. plans both have assets and liabilities above GBP 4 billion, which makes them the largest within MMC. Our goal in the U.K. -- and you're right that we recently made a change. Actually, it's effective, I believe, August 1. But we recently decided upon a change, in consultation with our colleagues in the U.K., to move from a defined benefit plan to close it and freeze it and move to a DC plan. And our goal in the U.K. was not to achieve cost savings. So let me just tell you that right off the bat. Our objective was to create a DC plan, which is highly competitive in the market, consistent and fair to all colleagues and which reduce risk over time for MMC. And we believe we've achieved that. Now in terms of other plans, we periodically review our plans to assess market competitiveness, consistency across MMC, risk, costs, all of those things. But right now, we have no current plans to amend any of our other DB plans at this point in time.","Charles Sebaski","And there isn't -- in terms of when you say reducing the risk, and I'm assuming the volatility, but that doesn't -- I mean, that doesn't equate into a cost save? I mean, I realize that the plan of it is to limit volatility, but that volatility would seem that it would be a volatility up, right, that's in the long term, maybe not next couple -- next quarter or 2, but the next couple of years should be some inherent cost savings, no?","Daniel S. Glaser","The -- any savings on large DB plans are driven more by interest rate movements and discount rate movements, a little bit of asset returns, that sort of thing as opposed to whether you're a DB or DC. The cost to the company for providing the benefit is actually quite similar. And we did have benefits in terms of mitigating -- essentially closing the DB plan and freezing it. We did receive a curtailment gain, which we cycled back largely to the colleague base in the U.K. in terms of mitigating the impact on some of our colleagues. So there's really no material financial impact based upon that change.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Just a couple of quick ones here. The first one, Mike, just a clarification on your comment with respect to the Trident III. Did you say that it's going to be offset, largely, any income by additional corporate initiatives?","J. Michael Bischoff","That's correct.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So we should expect just kind of breakeven for the investment gains for the remainder of the year?","J. Michael Bischoff","I think for modeling purposes, Brian, that makes a lot of sense.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then one other quick one for you, Mike. I noticed you guys raised $600 million, paying down $320 million, so you're going to have a little more debt on the balance sheet. Is there any kind of conscious initiative to maybe increase leverage here a little bit going forward?","Daniel S. Glaser","I think in general -- and I'll start off and then hand to Mike to add a little bit more color. I think our objective over time, and we talked a little bit about this at Investor Day, is to, over time, reduce cash on the balance sheet to the extent that's practical. Over time, to raise our level of debt as well still as a conservatively run company. But overall, our ability to handle more debt is certainly prevalent and interest rates are pretty low. We have a balanced approach. And so I think you're going to see both of those factors as we move forward over the next several quarters and a couple of years. But Mike, do you want to add to that?","J. Michael Bischoff","No, Dan. I think that's well said. It's a balance. We're improving and have improved our credit metrics, but we can continue to improve our credit metrics even with this steadily -- well, not steadily but beginning to expand the overall debt on our balance sheet. And that's, obviously, only one issue of leverage. It has to do with the pension obligations, present value of our operating leases, and we've worked very diligently on those areas as well. So as Dan said, it's a balance.","Operator","So that final question comes from Cliff Gallant with Nomura.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I just want -- I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the comments you made earlier about the underwriting environment and the cycle, particularly on the insurance side. I believe a few quarters ago, there was a comment made on your call that reinsurance pricing weakness was -- historically, has always led to a weakness on the primary side, and I'm curious as to what degree do you think things are different this time? Are things meeting your expectations? Has been there more or less disciplined among the insurance companies?","Daniel S. Glaser","It's Dan here. We don't think things will be different this time. We think, fundamentally, that as reinsurance prices reduce, it gives more flexibility for primary carriers to adjust their strategies and figure out other ways to grow their business. And some of that may be giving up some of the gains that they've obtained on their own reinsurance programs. But Peter, do you want to talk about what's happening in the retail?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. I think when we talk about reinsurance, it's been primarily driven by property cat and property declines. When we look at our overall portfolio, we're in so many different countries across the world, that they all tend to have different dynamics based on mix of business, based on geographical footprint. But if I was to comment and see what's happening on pricing on the primary side, we have seen more reductions; nothing dramatic, but a modest reduction continuing in the second quarter. If I look at some of the regions, Latin America probably had pricing falling off the most but it's still low to mid-single digits. Line of business was really driven by property. Having said that, we're cautiously optimistic that we're seeing more exposure increase on the overall book of business. And so looking at total insured values, payroll in the U.S., sales across the world has been a modest offset to some of the modest price declines.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Peter. And I think that about does it for the call. So I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. I'd also like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank everyone for your participation."],"14088":["Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE:MMC) Q3 2014 Earnings Call October 28, 2014  8:30 AM ET","","Executives","Daniel S.

Glaser","Thank you, Jamie and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. I'd also like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman Group. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","We live in an age of risk and uncertainty. Two years ago the world was reading about the eurozone crisis escalating tensions in the Middle East. The possible effects of climate change and the North East US was bracing for Superstorm Sandy. Today, recent headlines include cyber security, Ebola fears, healthcare cause and pension volatility to name a few. Our clients face greater challenges than ever before as they try to anticipate and react to what lies ahead. Across the spectrum of global companies, we believe Marsh & McLennan is uniquely positioned to advice clients around the issues of risk, strategy and people. ","We have many positive attributes including, a tremendous depth of talent in our colleague base, a collaborative and cohesive culture, market leading positions and a proven management team. In this uncertain environment, there should continue to be strong demand for our services and capabilities, which we believe will produce the same growth in revenue and earnings while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We also have balance sheet flexibility and believe we\u2019re well positioned to profit from a variety of market conditions. ","Moving to our results, in the third quarter, the company delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC\u2019s revenue growth was 7% with all operating companies contributing. This performance was achieved both organically and through our strategy of executing on quality acquisitions. On an underlying basis, revenue expanded 5%. This growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses for the 16th consecutive quarter. This ongoing record of consistent performance drove our adjusted margin up 50 basis points to 14.6%, our highest third quarter margin in more than a decade. ","Adjusted operating income rose 11%, while adjusted EPS grew 22%, extending our record of double-digit EPS growth to 13 quarters. ","Looking at risk and insurance services, revenue increased 7% to $1.6 billion or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $242 million, notwithstanding the impact of increased hiring at Guy Carpenter and the negative effects of foreign exchange both of which we highlighted last quarter.","Marsh\u2019s revenue increased 8% to $1.3 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. This was an outstanding performance, reflecting balance growth across geographies. The international division increased 5%, matching a strong average annual growth rate over the past five years.","Latin America with growth of 11%, reported its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Asia Pacific rose 5% and EMEA grew 4%. Underlying growth in the US\/Canada division was 4%. ","Marsh's revenue growth was driven by strong new business, particularly in countries such as the US, Canada, UK, Brazil and Peru. Guy Carpenter delivered 3% underlying revenue growth in the third quarter, its highest of the year.","This is a good performance, considering the ongoing rate reductions in many lines and increased retentions of risk by clients. Solid new business and penetration beyond our larger clients produced higher revenue in the quarter.","Revenue growth was driven by the US, continental Europe, UK Facultative and Global Specialties such as marine and aviation. In Consulting, revenue increased 7% to $1.5 billion or 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income reached $274 million, up 19% from the prior year. And the segment\u2019s margin expanded 180 basis points, to 17.8%, the best in over 30 years.","Mercer\u2019s revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 3% on an underlying basis with all major geographies contributing. When viewed by line of business, growth continues to be driven by investments, which expanded 10% and by Health, up 4%.","Two weeks ago, we provided an update on the excellent progress of Mercer Marketplace. Over 240 companies have chosen our exchange for their active and retiree solutions with approximately 40 new clients to Mercer health and benefits. These relationships cover 500,000 employees and retirees and provide exchange assets for a total of more than one million lives. This represents nearly five times the reach of Mercer Marketplace when compared with last year.","Oliver Wyman continued to deliver outstanding results in the third quarter with revenue expanding 18% to $429 million. This reflects excellent underlying growth of 16%, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. We anticipate that Oliver Wyman\u2019s growth will moderate in the fourth quarter.","The growth in the third quarter was driven by balance performance across industry groups with particular strength in financial services and geographic strength in North America and Europe.","In summary, we produced outstanding third quarter results and we remain well positioned to deliver on the long-term goals we committed to at Investor Day in March. Growth in revenue, long-term EPS growth of 13%, increasing cash flows, and return of capital to shareholders through reducing the share count and double-digit dividend growth. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","","Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, Marsh & McLennan\u2019s revenue increased 7% to $3.1 billion, or a 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $458 million, and the adjusted margin rose 50 basis points to 14.6%. GAAP EPS increased 20% to $0.54 and adjusted EPS rose 22% to $0.56, so another outstanding quarter both from a revenue growth and earnings standpoint.","Investment income, investment income was $26 million in the third quarter, including $24 million of carried interest in Trident III. We expect that the investment income in the fourth quarter should be de minimis. ","We had highlighted on our second quarter earnings call that any investment income that may occur in the last half of the year would most likely be offset by corporate initiatives, including strengthening our cyber security protections, expenses related to strategic investments, and transformation efforts, primarily within HR and finance.","Approximately half of the investment income in the third quarter was offset by these initiatives, brining third quarter corporate expense to $58 million. The level of spending in the fourth quarter for corporate initiatives should be similar to the amount spent this quarter.","Foreign exchange, as expected the negative effects of foreign exchange on risk and insurance services continued in the third quarter and most likely foreign exchange will negatively impact the fourth quarter as well.","Mercer completed its investment in Alexander Forbes in early October. As previously announced, Mercer\u2019s investment of approximately $300 million consists of two tranches, 15% last July when Alexander Forbes completed its initial public offering and approximately 19% in early October following the completion of customary regulatory approvals.","This transaction will be accounted for under the equity method and reported on a one-quarter lag basis. Accordingly in the fourth quarter, we will include the initial 15% share of Alexander Forbes\u2019 earnings, net of tax and amortization. ","Beginning in the first quarter of next year, the full 34% ownership will be reflected as net revenue in Mercer\u2019s operating results. ","Debt, in early September, we issued $800 million of debt, including $300 million of 2.35% five-year senior notes and $500 million of 3.5% ten and a half year senior notes. In early October, we used the proceeds to pay down $630 million of future debt obligations, including $230 million that was due to mature next September and $400 million due in 2019.","Expenses of 135 million for the early extinguishment of this debt were approximately $0.17 per share will be shown as a discreet item on our fourth quarter income statement. This expense will be excluded from our adjusted results in the fourth quarter. The recent debt refinancing allowed us to take advantage of low interest rates, extended the maturity of our overall debt portfolio, lowered our annual interest expense and reduced future refinancing risk. As our next bond maturity of $250 million is not due until April 2017.","We have now completed the reshaping of our debt maturity ladder that began three years ago. At the end of last year debt on our balance sheet was $3 billion with an average interest rate of 5.1%. Today our debt outstanding is $3.4 billion with an average interest rate of 3.9%. ","Cash utilization, cash was $2.65 billion at the end of the third quarter including the $800 million debt financing in September. Approximately $1.8 billion was held internationally. As I just discuss, $765 million was used to pay down the two debt maturities in early October. Cash utilized in the third quarter included $154 million for dividends, a $173 million for acquisitions and investments including Mercer\u2019s initial investment in Alexander Forbes of a $137 million and $250 million to repurchase $4.8 million shares. This marks the tenth consecutive quarter of share buy backs. ","Through nine months, cash deployed included $612 million for acquisitions and investments, $600 million to repurchase $11.8 million shares and $429 million for dividends. In total we have utilized more than $1.6 billion for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase this year. This certainly has us on track to reach our target of $2.1 billion for the year. ","At the end of the third quarter shares outstanding declined to $542 million from $547 million at the end of last year. In the third quarter the quarterly dividend increased 12% with the board having authorized the fourth quarter dividend of $0.28. Annual dividends per share this year will grow 10.4%. Clearly we\u2019re delivering on our Investor Day commitments to reduce the share count every year and to increase dividends by double-digits on an annual basis. ","Lastly I would like to reiterate what Dan said earlier. Our results in the third quarter were outstanding continuing the excellent performance we have achieved throughout the first nine months of this year. ","With that I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan. ","Daniel S. Glaser","","Thank you, Mike and operator we are ready to begin the Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator"," ","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) I\u2019m going to take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Hi, good morning. I was hoping to start off by spending I guess little more time on what you\u2019re seeing within more specifically on the organic revenue growth side. It picked up in the US and Canada in this quarter, can you just comment a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that and also what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the pricing environment on the primary side and just your expectations I guess for the organic growth there in Q4 and maybe looking forward to some initial indications for 2015.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Elyse. It\u2019s Dan. Let me just start by talking about the overall company for a little bit, I mean clearly we\u2019re happy with the growth. The quarter was 5% for Marsh & McLennan Companies and year-to-date is also 5%. Within this and as we\u2019ve said before each OPCO is different, some have more headwinds than others. If I look at both March, Marsh\u2019s 4% year-to-date, Mercer\u2019s 3% year-to-date, Guy Carpenter at 1% and Oliver Wyman at 15% and that mix taken together gives us our 5%. I would still bracket us though in a 3% to 5% organic growth world. I think that\u2019s really where the performance has been and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there. So generally when we\u2019re looking at our planning cycle and how we run the business and how we prepare for investments etcetera, it\u2019s anticipating that we\u2019re still on a 3% to 5% organic growth world, but Peter you want to talk about Marsh specifically. ","Peter Zaffino","","Sure, Dan. Thanks, Elyse for the question. Let me start by just giving you an overview on what happened in the quarter for Marsh. Again the 5% underlying revenue growth really proud of, it\u2019s the eighteenth consecutive quarter for us of organic growth. It was very balanced across the world, so we had all major geographies from international contributing and as you mentioned US and Canada did quite well too, with 4%. What drove that really was a lot of fundamentals. We had improved renewal revenue retention as well as client retention, so that contributed more in international than in the US and Canada because US and Canada had 1% growth at this time last year. But in the United States and Canada, we had terrific new business in the quarter. We had 13% growth year-over-year in new business. All the businesses that are in the US and Canada division did contribute to the top line, so when I look across the world, really pleased and proud of the performance, but it really was the fundamentals in executing across the world, which generate the revenue growth. ","Daniel S. Glaser","Any other question Elyse?","Elyse Greenspan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yes and then just in terms of Mercer Marketplace and the healthcare exchange enrollment, I know you mentioned the 500,000 employees that you have in your exchange this year. How would you in terms of describe I guess the headwind in terms of just the number of companies I guess that you spoke to and those that shows to join your exchange and maybe was there a difference what you saw this year versus last year. Also if there were some companies I guess that showed kind of wade \u2013 and make wade and not on your exchange this year, was that more that they were just holding off on their decision for another year or people just decided not to pursue a private health exchange entirely and on. One last question just based on the enrollment figures that you saw this year and a strong growth, do you expect to start to generate positive earnings from your healthcare exchange when we look out to 2015. Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Elyse. That\u2019s a hell of a question. So let me start by first giving some kudos to Julio and the team. We\u2019re very pleased with the early results of Mercer Marketplace. Now, Julio and the Mercer leadership team recognize the opportunity and they created a strategy to develop a comprehensive exchange capability that is user friendly, dynamic and flexible. They\u2019re now executing on that strategy and we expect this to be a big business for us someday and eventually a solid contributor to the results of Mercer\u2019s U.S. H&B business. However, from an MMC perspective let me just say, we really aren\u2019t counting on any meaningful contribution to MMC\u2019s overall earnings for the foreseeable future. But Julio, little bit more detail please. ","Julio A. Portalatin","","Thank you. Thanks for the question. I really want to set it in context first by talking a little bit about Mercer and where we\u2019ve come in and leading into the Mercer Marketplace and the questions that you ask. We are really pretty pleased with Mercer\u2019s third quarter performance. We were able to once again deliver a solid step forward in financial performance while making good progress on execution of our key strategic priorities and objectives. We produced another solid quarter of earnings growth and margin expansion. Our top line came in as Dan mentioned earlier 4% and then 3% on the underlying basis, up from our growth rate last quarter. We continue to be very actively involved in managing our cost base and investing in new opportunities while being disciplined across the board. ","Last quarter we discussed our strategic investment in Alexander Forbes and crossing the $100 billion assets under management mark in our investments business. This quarter we are really pleased with \u2013 that we\u2019re able to report significant growth and progress in our exchange solution Mercer Marketplace whether it is the roughly five fold increase in employees or our active exchange the growth in our retiree exchange or the lives that we have access to through delivery of voluntary benefits in individual insurance. ","Mercer Marketplace exchange platform on any measure has had a really good sales here and I\u2019m very proud of the team for the work that they\u2019ve done in this regard. Now as we position Marsh\u2019s marketplace today and into the future, we continue to look at covering trends and how and why our clients are being attracted to what we\u2019re offering. But the reality is that we are finding that our exchange solution has a number of key attributes that are very attractive to our client base and prospects. ","First, we stand the market and our exchange is available to companies with a few, has a hundred employees and with no real upper limit. Second, we had built in flexibility that many companies find to be of value, insured all self insured medical to find contribution or traditional funding as well as an array of voluntary benefits. ","Third, we have a single solution that spans every segment of an employer\u2019s population, from benefit, ineligible to sponsor group plans, to Medicare retirees. And finally, we\u2019ve seen very strong early proof of concept including cost savings and high energy and high employee appreciation of the support they receive from our benefit councils. ","So when you speak about why people are so attracted, those are some of the reasons we have seen and we\u2019ve heard from our clients as being the case and it\u2019s a full spectrum attraction and yes, there might be some early movers that are more likely to be considered in that middle market space, but we already are seeing for 2015 early adapters on the large market space and that\u2019s been a lot of competition most recently as well. So this is an evolving platform. It\u2019s an evolving business and we continue to lead and we expect to continue to be in that leading position for a long time to come.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Julio. Well, that answer certainly matched the question. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning and thank you for taking my call. So first question on the Guy Carpenter, the reinsurance brokerage actually, the organic growth 3% is very strong relative to the market condition. So on that, I just wonder your thoughts on \u2013 in the near term, what do you see the upcoming January renewal pricing and what could potentially impact on your business? And then on longer term if you think the change in the marketplace to see if there's more alternative capital and the primary company probably either ceding less to reinsurance market. So what's your \u2013 how do you adapt to the changing market there?","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Thanks, Kai Pan. So Alex, Bischoff comment about your growth and then looking a little bit further, what\u2019s the potential impact of alternative capital.","Alexander S. Moczarski ","Yeah, so we\u2019re really pleased about the third quarter 3% underlying growth is pretty good given the circumstances. On top of 5% growth the same quarter last year. How are we doing it? I think we are executing \u2013 I believe we are executing our strategic plan well. Our book of business has improved from the point of view of its robustness. We have less reliance on the very, very large clients that we still have, but we would rely on a lot go back five years. Bear in mind actually this is now I think its 23 quarters where we haven\u2019t gone backwards organically, only one quarter we were flat the rest have shown organic growth. So we have \u2013 we do lean forward, which I think is good. ","Our book of business has moved to being more of a recurring book of business as we\u2019ve done less transactional business in like Quill and other one-off products, as well as moving into our segments such as the mutual, the excess and surplus where they\u2019re slightly smaller clients or oftentimes much smaller clients, but they need us and so I feel pretty good about our book. ","I feel pretty good about the way we are focusing on growth areas such as accident and health, cyber, and also around innovate \u2013 innovation is really how Guy Carpenter was founded, the base on which Guy Carpenter was founded and we continue to innovate and I\u2019m pretty happy about the pipeline of new services and new client base in technology that we\u2019ll be coming out with over the coming year. So we continue to lean forward. We\u2019ve got, I believe, the best team in the business. We listen, we learn, we provide advice, we have insights and we look after our clients and I think without being arrogant and complacent that we continue to do that will maintain our relevance in there for our value. ","Going forward around pricing, it makes \u2013 you kind of hear every now and then, we are bouncing along the bottom and then you get surprised by further reductions in pricing. We will see. We will see. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve had adverse wins for a long time and we continue to be able to eke out growth and we hope to be able to do so going forward. That\u2019s something within our plans. ","And really that \u2013 so as far as alternative capital is concerned, we are agnostic to capital, we need to understand it. We need to make sure that our clients have free access to the best advices as regards where to go, who to rely on and that\u2019s what we are working on. There will be \u2013 there\u2019s some talk every now and then about this intermediation I think as long as lots of options and we're on our game we stand to be in good stead.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Thanks, Alex. Next question operator. ","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Thank you, Kai Pan. Next question operator.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Good morning and thank you. I\u2019m just wondering if we had turned back to the exchange and who \u2013 can you just elaborate a little bit on your strategy in the retiree market. I know you had decent growth there, but it seems like it\u2019s moving more slowly certainly than the employee numbers. So I am just wondering where you see yourself positioned relative to the competition there and any other comments you might have on that? Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser","So Julio, specific comments on the retiree exchange and our capability for retirees.","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay. Thanks, thanks, Larry. From the beginning, our exchange strategy has been to use the strength of our organization and creativity to put together the most flexible and comprehensive offering in the market and we are well positioned to continue to do that. It\u2019s obvious that the largest piece of the opportunity lies in the active space, all right, where there is 165 million employees, who are receiving their medical benefits through their employers and if you were to prioritize where you want to stand a lot of your early time certainly there in positioning yourself not just early, but for this long marathon run, you certainly want to do it then and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focus. Now, having said that, as you know we did make an acquisition with Transition Assist, we do have a continued investment in the call center capabilities and the technology capabilities for that sector and we will get our fair share of that business as we continue to grow and as always you have to continue to prioritize and reprioritize as the opportunity presents itself and we will continue to invest.","Daniel S. Glaser","That\u2019s a great answer. So our priority initially has been on the active space. We are still in the retiree market and we are in there swinging, but our focus has been more on actives than on retirees at this stage. Any other question Larry?","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Yeah, just numbers question. I know you are \u2013 the number for your \u2013 of Marsh employees that were included in actives, was there \u2013 were there any Marsh retirees in the retiree bucket?","Julio A. Portalatin","The answer is yes. There were Marsh retirees and it\u2019s about 2600.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Great. Thanks very much.","Julio A. Portalatin","It\u2019s about 20,000 on the active side.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Yeah, so 20000 on the active side for Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Julio A. Portalatin","Yeah, it\u2019s about 20,000 on the active side and retirees \u2013","Daniel S. Glaser ","","That\u2019s 2600 retirees for Marsh. Perfect.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Great, thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Next question, please.","Operator","And we will go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Hi and good morning. Just a free cash and sort of near-term sort of cash flow question, the debt pay down in the fourth quarter would seem to be using a lot of the U.S. cash and I\u2019m wondering if that means anything from a short-term perspective on buyback?","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Okay. So Mike, you want to handle that question.","J. Michael Bischoff ","Yeah and good morning Dan, thank you for the question. You are absolutely right as we manage our cash needs across the year, we have to take into account the seasonality of the needs, any acquisitions, obviously the dividend payments that we make, but then the appetite we have for share repurchase, and as you know from our Investor Day in March of this year, we\u2019re anticipating a fairly significant amount and level of a share repurchase throughout the entire year. I think it was 600 million through the first three quarters and we certainly are planning to continue to do that through the fourth quarter. ","Specifically to your question, the U.S. cash and the international cash, we typically build our cash positions throughout the company in the second half of the year and work them up towards our bonus payments that occur at the end of February of the following year. So looking at this year, we basically utilized our cash in the first quarter and then we began to build it up and that will continue to build up through the fourth quarter. But specifically on repatriation, we have not done that much repatriation of our international excess funds into the US through the first three quarters. We are planning to begin to do that more so in the fourth quarter, as well as in the first quarter in anticipation of the bonus payments, as I said, at the end of February of 2015.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Thanks, Mike. Dan any other question?","Dan Farrell \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Just one quick one on reinsurance, you guys have made a lot of hires and investments in the reinsurance business this year. Have you seen any benefit from those hires yet in the revenues? Or is that something that could be coming through down the road? Thanks.","J. Michael Bischoff","Yeah, so a couple of things on that, first of all, most of the hiring was last year as opposed to this year but we are still very alive to the opportunity that Guy Carpenter has as a premier provider in the space to hire more people now or in the future. So \u2013 and in terms of \u2013 I always shy away from those types of questions and answers that I hear across the space about production, people and production talents and what they would generally produce. We are a content company. Our job is to build the skills and capabilities of the organization. And when we hire people, we are largely hiring them to serve existing clients and we expect that our great service of existing clients will lead to more opportunities on that business and on perspective business on new clients in the future but it\u2019s never a calculation for us as to we are hiring these people and we are hoping they create revenue this amount this year and certain amount the following year after that. So we are building capabilities as opposed to sales capacity per se. It\u2019s sales based upon content capability.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you. On the risk and insurance services segment for the year-to-date, it\u2019s 3% organic revenue growth and 5% operating profit growth. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of whether at some point we should expect that profit growth to accelerate and if there are any headwinds currently, if you can outline those that will be helpful too? Thanks.","J. Michael Bischoff ","Jay, this is Mike. I think on an adjusted basis, it was 6% year-to-date. I just want to make sure that in operating income growth, make sure everyone has the correct facts. Okay, but your question is still right considering that we\u2019ve been delivering across MMC double-digit adjusted operating income growth for quite a period of time now. I think that we are in our sixth straight year of double-digit adjusted operating income growth for the company. We look at what we\u2019ve said before that 3% is \u2013 3% organic growth is sort of the sweet spot for the company and then when we grow above 3%, it\u2019s easier for us to not only drive adjusted operating income growth but also margin as well. And clearly when you look on a year-to-date basis, Guy Carpenter year-to-date has grown 1%, which basically means we are not looking for any margin expansion from Guy Carpenter and in fact we\u2019ll spend any amount of money to protect the franchise and build the franchise for the future. ","And so underneath the covers, you can pretty much imagine that Guy Carpenter is having a year where we\u2019re treading water at best on a margin basis and margin is still rocketing forward and that overall arrives in a result. And so when we look forward into the future, we live as we were mentioning earlier in a tremendously uncertain environment with a lot of moving parts. But I don\u2019t think there is a finer risk and insurance services organization in the world nor finer risk and insurance services leadership team, so I would bet on us in terms of being able to optimize whatever value is available in the world with respect to risk and insurance services.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay and then on a separate topic, there were a number of changes announced in the financial function across company, I was wondering if you could touch on those in terms of how we should be thinking about that?","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Sure. Well, I mean, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve had a number of changes on the colleague front across the organization and within Marsh, Mercer specifically we\u2019ve had a number of announcements of management moves and management changes and clearly you\u2019ve seen some things that we\u2019ve done on the function side where we\u2019ve announced that both Marsh and Mercer are getting new CFOs and Mark McGivney has moved from Marsh into a corporate function. We have a very strong finance function and we are just positioned in ourselves to optimize that financial function for the benefit of the overall firm. And generally when we are making these moves, finance or otherwise, it shows the health of the organization and I was very excited to see particularly in Marsh and Mercer recently with several of the announcements that have been made giving high quality people who are a big part of our future, new opportunities to hone and test and develop their skills.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. So it\u2019s all being done for position and strength?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Absolutely.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right. Thanks, Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser ","","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Dan, can you talk a little bit about whether you are seeing signs of, I guess, or what signs you are seeing of possible global economic slowdown?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Sure. Why don\u2019t I start with that and then I\u2019ll move it around the table so each of the operating company CEOs can give some commentary on it. But as I mentioned in the script, I really do believe we are living in unprecedented times, essentially in Asia, risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s also in Asia relentless acceleration. Opportunities and challenges develop faster than any point that I\u2019ve seen in my career. Over the past few years, the world has seemingly traded a set of financial concerns whether that\u2019s global growth, financial stability, unemployment, or a new set of financial and economic concerns, which is less about stability and less about unemployment and more about growth. ","And so you\u2019re reading now a lot of growth concerns whether that\u2019s with regard to continental Europe, the developing market, particularly China, et cetera. And the looming potential threat of recession or even deflation in certain economies and into all of that economic bucket is a set of political and geopolitical concerns that we just haven\u2019t seen really until the last couple of years. And so then, I guess, you could add to the mix discreet items such as Ebola or cyber attacks and it creates quite a mixture of concern for us. I mean, from our perspective being so well positioned around the world and in 130 different countries, issue on an economy basis, if you are talking macro, really it\u2019s about continental Europe more than any other factor because as we have mentioned before, if we look at Europe including the UK, it\u2019s about a third of our business. UK is about a half of that. ","So you\u2019re still talking about continental Europe representing 16, 17% of our business. If you recall in mid 2013, so not too long ago, about a year ago, most economists became cautiously optimistic about European prospect and believing that GDP had dwarfed. We still seem to be bouncing around the bottom as far as we concern \u2013 as we are concerned. When we look at the data points month-to-month, it\u2019s very consistent. It\u2019s one step forward, two steps back, two steps forward, one step back, particularly in continental Europe. It\u2019s clear that relative to the US and the UK continental Europe is choppier and has a more uncertain economic environment. In the past, insurance has acted kind of as a lagging indicator and consulting has pretty much been a forward indicator in terms of business activity and confidence but why don\u2019t I stop there and just move it around the table and get some commentary. Scott, you want to kick this off?","Scott McDonald ","Yeah, good morning Meyer. I\u2019ll try and give you a little bit of insight from what we are seeing on the demand for consulting, which has done sometimes at least as a leading indicator. In the US, there is nothing surprising. The US economy remains relatively slow but there is growth, there is still business confidence there and we\u2019ve got a very robust and \u2013 for consulting across almost all sectors of the economy. So that hasn\u2019t changed. ","In Europe, you all have the data and clearly there is an enormous slowdown in Europe on the economic side. We still don\u2019t see that on the consulting side of the business, so at least in Oliver Wyman, where we\u2019ve got \u2013 it isn\u2019t as robust as in the US, but it\u2019s still strong demand and again it\u2019s across all sectors ranging from manufacturing to financial services. So it\u2019s not focused on a specific part of the economy. ","I think that must be a lag because the economy has slowed down so much there. I would expect that had some impact on our demand. It\u2019s hard to imagine how it couldn\u2019t. One bit of good news on Europe, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of is the ECB completed their asset quality review and stress test over the weekend. ","Oliver Wyman supported them with that work and we do hope that will now provide some more confidence in the banking system and may provide some impetus for growth in Europe we will see. And then outside North America and Europe, it\u2019s mixed across the world. We are definitely seeing some weaker growth everywhere but nothing severe and again it hasn\u2019t fed through into consulting demand which remains strong in almost all markets with maybe the possible exception of Latin America.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Scott. Will it stay in the consulting segment for now and Julio, give us some commentary please.","Julio A. Portalatin","Yeah, a lot of what Scott mentioned certainly applies to some of our business for sure. I mean, in general we are pretty bullish on the U.S. in terms of our value proposition solutions. Pipelines were good. We continue to see demand for our very large set of solutions. Little bit tempered just about everywhere else, give-or-take, we see a certain market slowdown in Europe. Now in our case about 50% of our European business is out of the UK. ","The UK is fairing slightly better than the rest of the continent, but of course, it\u2019s not going to be immune if the continent continues to slow down, but we are seeing a demand for our services and pipeline improvement in the UK. It\u2019s kind of stabilization of pipeline in Germany, a little bit of an improvement in some other parts of the continent. We\u2019ll see if that actually results in revenue increasing. But when everything is said and done, even if we do see a bit of a softer side on the revenue side, we are seeing earnings growth this year and we expect that we will be able to position ourselves for continued earnings growth even in a slowing revenue environment.","Daniel S. Glaser","","Thanks, Julio. Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Try not to be repetitive, I think the economic factors that really drive insurance in terms of growth, total insured value, sales, payroll, employee count, are all growing \u2013 growing modestly across the world. So it\u2019s fairly balanced and a little bit of a tailwind that that\u2019s offsetting some of the pricing. As Dan highlighted, if we look at continental Europe, again we are cautiously optimistic that we are in a stable environment, but if I look at our revenue growth in the quarter, we had 33 countries that generated more than 10% organic growth, a 11 of those came from continental Europe, so third of our growth, so it\u2019s encouraging. I want to be cautiously optimistic, but we are in a fairly stable environment. So overall I don\u2019t see a material impact and that contributing to the slowdown.","Daniel S. Glaser","Alex, do you have anything to add. ","Alexander S. Moczarski","Just to say that \u2013 you mentioned the Ebola and cyber, Ebola, we've brushed off our SARS files and we're looking to be able to relate it with the time when SARS came out and so we have our working party on that, so I view that as a side opportunity. Cyber we are certainly seeing opportunity there. As it gets tougher to grow, we are seeing more demand for our strategic advisory help, so in general, we are still I believe, on the wake internationally and I think given that this opportunity to grow, so I\u2019ve remained cautiously optimistic.","Daniel S. Glaser","So Meyer, I hope that wasn\u2019t too much for you, but that\u2019s our take on the macro question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.","No, that was outstanding and if I could just throw one numbers question to Mike, do we have a sense yet of corporate expenses in terms of run rate for 2015?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yeah, I will just take that. Our expectation would be our corporate expense in 2015 would revert back to something akin to the 45 million or so per quarter.","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Next question, please.","Operator","And we will go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Yeah, good morning everyone.","Daniel S. Glaser","Good morning.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","If I look at the pledged capital deployment shareholders for 2014, you guys talked about 2.1 billion and said it probably wouldn\u2019t be lower than that for 2015. Obviously net operating profits are lower than that right now and they will be for a few years I assume. I\u2019m not asking for a long-term capital deployment plan, but when you guys think about your strategy, are you going to grow into that $2.1 billion number over multi-years or do you think the capital return to shareholders is inflated over the near-term?","Daniel S. Glaser","I\u2019ll absolutely \u2013 I\u2019ll start with that and then hand it to Mike. We absolutely believe that we will continue to grow our adjusted operating income and our cash flow will grow even faster is our expectation over the course of our three or four-year planning cycle. And when we spoke at Investor Day and made a commitment to $2.1 billion or [they are about] (ph) for 2014 and that 2015 would be similar to that. Our position on that has not changed and then I\u2019ll hand over to Mike who will fill you in some of the details on how we would arrive on that kind of number for 2015.","J. Michael Bischoff ","Well, thank you, Dan. And Josh, excellent question, and as Dan indicated, there is a number of premises with regard to our commitment to investors. The first premise and something that we\u2019ve shared with investors is for many years our free cash flow was basically diverted into other activities. But starting several years ago and currently and going forward, that free cash flow is available for reinvestment in the business, acquisitions, capital expenditures, it\u2019s in return on capital of the shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends. So when we looked at 2014, we had a few things going on. ","First we had a very high level of cash going into the year more than just on a seasonal basis and our intent was to utilize our excess cash over the course of 2014, which we have been doing and we will continue to do. Then the second thing which is one premise of your question then is, well, is that all there is and what does that mean for the implications going forward? Well, as Dan indicated and we would like to anticipate, we plan on very healthy increases in our free cash flow going into next year and continuing. ","The third thing has to do with debt capacity and we came into this year with $3 billion of debt on our balance sheet and we have $3.4 billion as it stands today. We feel our credit metrics have improved over the last three, four years and in fact, we think that the credit metrics will continue to improve over the next two to four years. However, it also means that within that improvement of credit metrics basically because of earnings growth, we feel we have a little bit more capacity to grow our debt. So overall, it\u2019s a combination of utilizing our excess cash, little bit higher debt levels, but mainly the core of it is very strong operating earnings, very strong cash flow, and the growth of that cash flow.","Daniel S. Glaser ","Any other questions, Josh.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Yeah, just a quick one. On the last conference call, you said we might want to expect there could be some investment income from Trident coming through, but generally that would probably be offset by incremental corporate initiative expenses. Did we see the corporate initiative expenses this quarter? Does that mean that margins are slightly depressed or that didn\u2019t happen?","Daniel S. Glaser ","Mike, you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yeah, thank you, Josh, and I\u2019m sorry if we weren\u2019t clear on that. We did say on the second quarter earnings call that for all intents and purpose is investment income over the last six months of this year would be offset by corporate initiatives. ","There is many smaller corporate initiatives, the three larger ones that we spoke to and so when we looked at the third quarter, we had some idea of what investment income would be but we had a very little idea of what fourth quarter would be. Now sitting here at the end of October, we have a fairly clear idea that investment income over the course of the last six months would be in that neighborhood of $26 million. That said the corporate initiatives over the last six months of the year or the additional corporate initiatives will absorb that, about half of it in the third quarter and about half in the fourth quarter.","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","And will those corporate initiatives continue into \u201915 or there is some sort of inflation of corporate spend right now going on?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes there is a \u2013 there is higher levels of corporate spend, which we believe to last on a temporary basis and we don\u2019t expect much of it to continue into 2015.","J. Michael Bischoff","","And you\u2019ll see that all in our corporate line as you did this quarter with corporate expenses being $58 million, as Dan indicated our normal run-rate of corporate expenses is around $45 million. So you saw it very clearly in this quarter and you\u2019ll see it most likely to the same extent in the next quarter. ","Joshua D. Shanker \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","","Thank you and congratulation on the quarter.","J. Michael Bischoff","","Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser","","Next question operator.","Operator","","We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Hi, good morning. The first question is on the pace of margin expansion in consulting, so it seems that Oliver Wyman is probably driving a lot of the pace of margin expansion given the growth, I was curious if that\u2019s true and should we see a slowdown in the pace of growth there because of global slowdown. Should we expect the pace of margin expansion to also slow?","Daniel E. Glaser","Okay, so let me address that. We don\u2019t break out the margins in the \u2013 in either segments, I mean the operating companies. We would say that as a leadership team several years ago, we identified consulting\u2019s, margins as an issue for us to address as a leadership team and to get underneath because we thought that with greater levels of financial discipline and sales capability that we could actually drive consulting margins far higher than what they were and so this is not a one year story at all. If you look at it in terms of \u2013 in 2012 consulting was up 150 basis points, in 2013 consulting was up 160 basis points and year-to-date consulting is up 170 basis points. So we have had three years of dramatic change in consulting\u2019s margins. ","We\u2019re right in the middle of our budgeting and planning cycle for the next several years and so it\u2019s really too early for us to tell, I mean clearly from a margin expansion we will work in both segments to expand margins with higher levels when we have higher levels of organic growth, we will seek to do that. And we expect in both segments over the course of the next three to five years that there\u2019s tremendous opportunity that we have to go out there and execute on which would help our margins. But also as we\u2019ve said many times, we\u2019re not driven by \u2013 we don\u2019t have a margin issue in the company, we\u2019re not driven by margin expansion. We\u2019re focused much more on revenue growth, earnings growth and margin expansion is an outcome of having our revenue almost always exceed our expense growth and so that\u2019s our position with regard to margins. Any other question? ","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Yes, just on Mercer. What percentage of their business is recurring versus this consulting revenue?","Daniel E. Glaser","Mercer.","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay, so just to clarify, of the consulting segment just keep in mind that Mercer makes up about three quarters of the revenue of the consulting segment, so when you make assessments or some estimates about improvements it would have to be a lot on that side in order for it to happen. So let me clarify that point. Second point is that when everything is said and done, we continue to work hard to improve over a long term our results and we have a sustainable strategy to be able to do that and we will continue to do that as we go forward. ","Daniel E. Glaser","The recurring revenue, how much is \u2013","Julio A. Portalatin","It\u2019s about \u2013 it depends on the overall, so the \u2013 for Mercer it\u2019s about 70% recurring and 30% project oriented.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc","Thank you.","Daniel E. Glaser","And the next question. I think we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. We will take that final question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","","Thank you, just a quick one here on exchanges. Most of my questions were answered. It seems like the investments in exchange are going to offset the margin benefits in the near term. Is there a level of enrollment where margin contribution would outpace the potential for expenses or do you expect that you\u2019ll continue to kind of manage the business that way until you reach scale?","Daniel E. Glaser","","Yeah, so let me address that. I mean, first of all as we\u2019ve said a couple of times, we are in the very early stage of a new business. A business that has dramatic amount of potential for us, but we are also cautious because we\u2019re in such an early stage and we don\u2019t necessarily think that every competitor that could be in this segment is already in the segment. Today at the end of the day business attracts completion and so it\u2019s very hard for us to make any kind of long term assessment. ","What I would say is that we really aren\u2019t expecting any earnings contribution and that we will invest whatever money is necessary to position Mercer as one of the leaders eventually in this exchange segment. So on that basis it\u2019s not a situation that that we\u2019re seeking earnings from the exchange segment, we will be recycling any benefits that we get in any kind of short or midterm back into the business as we grow and position ourselves to be one of the leaders.","Michael Steven Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc","","Okay, so \u2013 I mean, if you think about those investments as you recycle those dollars, I\u2019m guessing that either the ROI or something about investing in the exchange makes that an attractive place to put dollars to work. How about operating margins, if we clear out the infrastructure expenses or investments, is there a way to think about that even relative to your kind of baseline benefits business.","Daniel E. Glaser","","Yeah, Julio you want to take that without getting into details about the margin?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yeah, thank you. I mean our exchange business has the potential to take business for us, we\u2019ve said that before and in near we\u2019re not expecting significant contribution to earnings as Dan said. Longer term, we expect margins on the exchange as we said that the investor meetings that we had back in March, we expect margin of the exchange to be roughly in line with our margins in our health focused business today, which is one of our highest margin businesses that we have in the company. So investment in the rapidly growing business lies, significant ramp up in the administration and that\u2019s why we have an servicing and that\u2019s why you have some early moderation as far as impact on earnings on a positive sense and if sales pace continues modest dilution will happen of course in the earliest, but as we said in 2014 we\u2019ve managed to invest and still deliver great margin and great earnings improvement for the segment. So we\u2019ll continue \u2013 meaning the Consulting segment for MMC.","Daniel E. Glaser","Did that take care of it, Mike?","","Michael Steven Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc","","Sure, thanks.","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay, thank you.","Daniel E. Glaser","Okay, so I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning and in particular I\u2019d like to thank our clients for their support and our collogues for their hard work and dedication in serving them.

Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","I am pleased with our results for both the third quarter and nine months. Over these periods, we produced underlying revenue growth across all operating companies, along with higher adjusted operating income and margin expansion in both segments. For the nine months, adjusted EPS rose 8%.","We continue to execute and grow in a challenging macro environment. As a global growth company, we are not immune to the effects of modest global GDP growth, low interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar or the slowdown in emerging economies. Despite this environment, we are on track for 2015 to be the sixth consecutive year that we have generated underlying revenue growth of at least 3%.","We have several attributes which make us optimistic about our ability to generate good, long-term revenue growth. We have a vast geographic footprint in all of our businesses, especially RIS. This gives us the balance to benefit from varying levels of global growth. In most years, global premiums tend to rise despite negative pricing trends. In addition, we view risk as a growth business. Increasing exposures from new emerging risk, globalization and economic uncertainty create volatility and disruption. Our clients' need for advice and services is only rising. We are able to meet these needs through the quality and depth of our colleague base and our collaborative and cohesive culture. This underpins our consistent long-term revenue growth, both organic and acquired at RIS.","In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from favorable long term global trends in consulting. At Mercer, the need for advice around issues of health, wealth and career are increasing. Mercer is a trusted advisor, serving clients and their more than 110 million employees in over 100 countries. Oliver Wyman provides deep industry knowledge and strategic expertise to their clients around issues of growth, change and efficiency.","We also use capital management to drive growth. Through nine months, we have already exceeded the $2.3 billion of capital deployed for acquisitions, dividends and buybacks for all of 2014. The primary sources of this capital have been increasing levels of operating cash flow and using our balance sheet. In 2015, we raised $1.1 billion of incremental debt and we continue to work down cash balances.","While capital utilization has been substantial, we have maintained balance sheet flexibility, which we believe is prudent. We manage for the long-term and reinvestment is a constant. We invest through cycles and preserve our ability to take advantage of periods of dislocation to invest in our colleagues and capabilities, add to our talent base, and make acquisitions. This balanced strategy has served us well as evidenced by our ability to deliver in a variety of market environments. Now let's turn to our results.","In the third quarter, we produced underlying revenue growth of 4%, 6% growth in adjusted operating income, a 100 basis point rise in our adjusted operating margin to 15.6%, our highest third-quarter margin in more than a decade, and 13% growth in adjusted EPS. Through nine months, underlying revenue rose 3%, adjusted operating income was up 5%, the margin expanded 120 basis points, and adjusted EPS increased 8%.","For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the third quarter was $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%, adjusted operating income grew 3%, and the margin increased 70 basis points to 15.7%. Through nine months, underlying revenue growth was 2%, adjusted operating income rose 4% to $1.2 billion, and the margin increased 130 basis points to 24.1%, the highest in over a decade. This margin improvement continues a march we have been on since 2007, when adjusted margins in the RIS segment were at their lowest.","At Marsh, revenue in the third quarter was $1.3 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. The U.S.\/Canada division grew 2%, led by Marsh and McLennan Agency. The MMA strategy has been very successful. Since 2009, MMA has made approximately 50 acquisitions with annualized revenues approaching $900 million. In our International division, the increase was also 2%, reflecting modest growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, and a 6% increase in Latin America.","In September, Marsh announced its intention to acquire U.K.-based insurance broker, Jelf Group. This aligns with Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the SME space. We expect the transaction to close within the next several months.","With the recent acquisition of Dovetail, Marsh continues to broaden its services in the small commercial segment. Dovetail's flexible and scalable technology offers agents access to online real-time quoting and binding from multiple insurance providers. Through nine months, Marsh's underlying revenue was up 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in U.S.\/Canada and 2% in the International division.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $261 million in the third quarter, an increase of 2% on an underlying basis and 1% through nine months. This was a reasonable result considering the significant rate reductions in many lines. The U.S. and EMEA were areas of strength driven by strong retention rates and new business wins in treaty.","Moving to Consulting, revenue was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 4% to $285 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 18.5%, the 15th consecutive quarterly increase. Similar to RIS, consulting has a record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. The improvement has been at least 150 basis points in each of the past three years, and with additional expansion so far in 2015, the third quarter margin was the highest in over 30 years.","Through nine months, underlying revenue growth was 5%, adjusted operating income increased 4% and the margin expanded 90 basis points to 17.5%.","Mercer's revenue was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting an underlying increase of 5%. Revenue growth was achieved across all three of Mercer's major geographies \u2013 North America, Euro-Pac and growth markets. Mercer's growth was broad-based with investments, talent and health each growing 6%. Retirement rose 2%. Investments continued its long-term positive performance. AUM increased to $138 billion as new client assets more than offset market and FX pressure. Talent once again performed well. It generated its fourth consecutive quarter of growth driven by its seasonally strong survey business and increased demand for project consultancy work. Mercer recently announced a strategic alliance with Transamerica, which will acquire Mercer's U.S. defined contribution record-keeping business. Mercer continues to directly serve client benefit administration needs in both the defined benefit and health businesses. The Transamerica alliance enables an integrated total benefit outsourcing solution.","Health continues to benefit from Mercer Marketplace, despite lower growth in our administration business as we execute our strategy to improve profitability. Earlier this month, we issued an update on the progress of Mercer Marketplace. In total, the exchange now serves over 700,000 employees and retirees, and provides exchange access for an anticipated 1.5 million lives, an increase of 43% compared with last year. We are pleased with the continuing growth of Mercer Marketplace, although we would highlight we do not expect it to contribute to earnings in 2016.","Oliver Wyman's revenue in the third quarter was $450 million, reflecting strong underlying growth of 9%. Through nine months, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth of 6%, which builds on growth of 15% in the same period last year. The nine months' performance reflected revenue growth in all practice groups and business units.","In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and nine months' results as we continue to execute well. For the full year, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments, and high single-digit EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone.","In the third quarter, we delivered underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies. Both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 13% and adjusted EPS increased 13% as well. Considering the macro headwinds we are facing and our mitigation activities, we believe you get a clearer picture of earnings growth and margin improvement by gearing our results on a year-to-date basis. Our financial results through nine months show adjusted operating income increased 5% to $1.9 billion, the adjusted operating margin expanded from 18.5% to 19.7%, with RIS expanding 130 basis points and consulting increasing 90 basis points. Both GAAP and adjusted EPS increased 8%, indicative of our progress this year.","Our results are being impacted significantly by the strength of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, especially the Euro. And in the second half of the year, the dollar has continued to strength against the Canadian and Australian dollar, and the currencies of most emerging markets. At the beginning of the year, we estimated the negative impact to EPS from foreign exchange would be approximately $0.15 per share, the highest level in MMC's history. We now estimate the full-year impact will be $0.18 per share \u2013 $0.06 in the first quarter, $0.04 in the second, $0.03 in the third and we now expect a $0.05 impact in the fourth quarter.","We recently changed the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan by dividing it into two separate plans, one that includes active colleagues and a second that includes inactives which account for about 70% of U.S. plan participants, both retiree and terminated vested. This structure better positions MMC to take advantage of derisking opportunities in the future such as voluntary lump sum offers and annuity purchases. This change has no effect on the future benefits earned by our U.S. colleagues or the benefits previously earned by former colleagues. We are using a longer amortization period for the inactive plan, which will lower annual pension expense although the benefit this year is modest.","Many factors go into determining our pension expense: assumptions for mortality changes, asset performance and the discount rate, to name a few. As we typically do each year, we will provide an outlook for MMC's retirement plan expense on our fourth quarter earnings call in February, after the year-end measurement. While it is too early to give an estimate for next year, based upon the variety of factors we are looking at today, we believe the company is well-positioned to offset any retirement expense headwind we could face in 2016.","Investment income. Trident III, which was created in 2003, sold its last two investments in the third quarter. As a result, MMC's carried interest is no longer subject to clawback. In the third quarter, the $34 million of investment income primarily came from Trident III. For the nine months, investment income was $39 million, a slight increase from $37 million last year. MMC's private equity portfolio is $85 million, which should generate only modest investment income on an annual basis.","Total debt was $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. We took advantage of favorable credit market conditions by pulling forward the debt issuance we had contemplated for the first quarter of next year. Also influencing this decision was our robust acquisition pipeline, and we wanted to take advantage of the decline in the equity markets to repurchase our shares at attractive prices. The $600 million senior note issued in September has an interest rate of 3.75% and will mature in 2026. We've been restructuring our debt portfolio the last several years and have reduced our average interest rate from 5.6% to 3.5%. Our annual interest expense in 2011 was $200 million with $3 billion of debt outstanding. Today, with $4.5 billion of debt, our annual interest expense would approximately $175 million.","We have reduced our refinancing risk by spreading out maturities over a number of years. For example, the next bond repayment of $250 million is not due until April of 2017. The debt is supported by a significantly higher level of operating earnings. The company is in a strong financial position today. Over the last few years, we have used our balance sheet while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities.","The recent volatility in the equity markets allowed us to pull forward a portion of our share repurchases planned for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. We repurchased 9.9 million shares in the third quarter for $550 million and over the first nine months we repurchased 23.4 million shares for $1.3 billion.","Our tax rates fluctuates quarter-to-quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local rates. For the third quarter, our adjusted tax rate was 28.4%. This represents an underlying tax rate of 29.5% and a slight benefit related to filing our 2014 federal tax return in September. For modeling purposes, based on the current landscape it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29.5% in the fourth quarter and 29% for 2016.","Our cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.3 billion with $445 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter included $165 million for dividends, $190 million for acquisitions and $550 million for share repurchases. Through nine months, uses of cash included $470 million for dividends, $590 million for acquisitions and adjustments and $1.3 billion for share repurchases.","At our Investor Day in March 2014, we made two commitments concerning returning capital to shareholders: one, double-digit annual dividend increases; and two, a reduction in our share count each year. We are delivering on these commitments for 2015, as we did in 2014. Our annual dividend increased 11.3% this year after increasing 10.4% last year. Our share count will decline for the second straight year. In fact, shares outstanding has declined by 27 million shares since Investor Day.","Capital deployed for share repurchases, dividends and acquisitions was $1.2 billion for 2013. In 2014, capital deployed almost doubled, to $2.3 billion; and through the first nine months of this year totaled $2.4 billion. Our robust capital management has been supported by strong operating cash flows, the deployment of excess cash and increased debt.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike. Before we go to Q&A, I would like to make a few comments about our recently announced CFO transition.","Mark McGivney will become MMC's Chief Financial Officer at the start of 2016. Over the past year in his current position as Senior Vice-President of MMC Corporate Finance, Mark worked closely with Mike and me in developing and executing our financial strategy. Mark also has a very strong operational background and becomes the first MMC Chief Financial Officer to have served as CFO of both Marsh and Mercer. Mark was CFO at Marsh from 2007 to 2011, where he was a key member of my leadership team and oversaw substantial restructuring actions and operational improvements that re-established Marsh's profitability. From 2011 to 2014, Mark was CFO and Chief Operating Officer of Mercer, where he worked closely with Julio to drive strong improvement at Mercer. Welcome, Mark. We look forward to hearing from you on next quarter's earnings call.","I would also like to say a few words about Mike, and to take a moment to recognize the many contributions he has made to Marsh and McLennan Companies over the past 34 years, the last three-and-a-half as Chief Financial Officer. Mike has worked tirelessly and creatively on an array of complex issues in leading our finance colleagues around the globe. By always demonstrating tremendous skill, knowledge and judgment, Mike leaves a legacy of extraordinary professionalism, commitment and dedication for us to build upon in the future. I am pleased that Mike will serve as a part-time senior advisor to MMC through the first quarter of 2016. On behalf of the 58,000 colleagues at Marsh and McLennan Companies around the world, I would like to say thank you, Mike, for your outstanding service.","Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll have our first question from Dan Farrell, Piper Jaffray.","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you, and good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the brokerage, organic specifically in Marsh, we're seeing a little slowdown in both the U.S. and internationally? Could you give us a little more color in terms of sort of headwinds from both pricing and exposure? And then could you talk about your abilities to offset that with net new business and how much you think you can offset further headwinds? Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think because much of the impact on our revenue as a company relates to some macro factors, like GDP or the P&C cycle, maybe it would be a good idea for me to give just a very brief comment, and then just go around the horn and have each of our operating companies give an assessment as to how they're \u2013 what they're looking at today and as they look forward \u2013 for revenue growth. And so I'm pretty pleased, because despite macro headwinds, as I mentioned from GDP, property and casualty rate, and some tough comps, MMC grew revenue by 4%. And year-to-date, revenue growth underlying is up 3% versus the prior year-to-date at 5%. So I feel pretty good about where we are and I'm confident that we remain in the 3% to 5% underlying revenue growth zone as an overall company. But Peter, do you want to start with Marsh?","Peter Zaffino - Chairman - Risk & Insurance Services and President & Chief Executive Officer - Marsh, LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. It's probably helpful to put a little context around the numbers for the quarter. Compared to last year's quarter three, again, it was a 5% organic growth so it was going to be challenging for us; that was the highest underlying growth rate we've had in the past 12 quarters, so it is a tough comparable year-over-year. Some countries have been particularly challenged, specifically in large, commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil, even parts of Africa. So those have been a little bit of a headwind.","And you mentioned pricing. Pricing has been orderly, but it has been coming off year-over-year and slightly from the second quarter to third quarter. We have been undergoing several yield initiatives to offset some of the rate decreases, and there's been some economic growth, albeit slow, in sales, payroll, total insured values. So overall, the 2% is not what we believe will be our medium- and long-term growth rates. But overall, when I look at the core, underlying parts of the business, new business, client retention is very strong.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Peter. Alex?","Alexander Moczarski - Chairman; President and Chief Executive Officer, Guy Carpenter & Company LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. The headwinds in the reinsurance area are well known, have been discussed, I guess, pretty much over the last three or four years. But we've continued to be able to grow. I said at the beginning of the year that some quarters might be clunky, but at the end of the day, we are still feeling fairly positive. The pipeline remains good. We're benefiting from segmentation and specialization. Shares have actually grown with the mid- to larger-sized insurance companies as they find our how good our teams are, how useful our tools are, and how sophisticated our solutions are. So, we're still looking in growth mode.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So that takes care of RIS. Why don't we spend a little time on consulting, so Julio, you want to talk to us about revenue growth?","Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,","Thanks, Dan. First, I'd like to just start off by saying that we were pretty pleased with the solid revenue growth that we had and demonstrated in the third quarter. I was particularly pleased with the balance of that growth across our LOBs [lines of business]. And you know we have a habit now of, quarter after quarter, finding a way to continue to have that spread between revenue growth and expenses so, of course, our margin continues to also improve. We've entered into a strategic alliance with Transamerica, which we think is going to be good for our clients, good for our going forward. And it continues to reinforce, as we've talked about in the past, dis-investing in some of our non-core, as we continue to invest in our core for growth into the future. Things like bolstering our talent business, investing in things like building Mercer Marketplace, and expanding our solutions even further in things like Workday with implementation capabilities, Jeitosa, et cetera. And expanding also our European investment capabilities, which has shown up in some of the improvement that we've had in assets under management, going to $1.38 billion this particular quarter.","So our investments have been well-calculated. We continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our growth into the future by increasing footprint across the globe and doing other things. So we're pretty optimistic about how we can continue to generate growth at Mercer.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. And just rounding it all out, Scott.","Scott McDonald - Chief Executive Officer, Oliver Wyman Group, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Sure. Dan, Oliver Wyman had a good quarter and year-to-date we've had strong growth across most sectors. In the nine months, all of financial services, health, actuarial, Lippincott and NERA grew more than 7%. And in any annual period, we continue to target growth planned at the range for MMC that Dan highlighted, so say 5% or better, driven by continued growth in the demand for high quality consulting as well as our ability to take share from competitors. It is important to keep in mind though, that given the nature of much of our business which is large, lumpy consulting projects, there'll certainly be volatility around that target from quarter-to-quarter. But overall, the business is in good shape and getting better, so we expect to be able to continue to grow.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, tanks. Dan, I know that was an overall long question but I figured revenue was likely to be on several people's minds so we wanted to cover it broadly. Do you have any other question?","Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","No, that's helpful detail across all the segments. Thank you and Mike, all the best to you going forward.","J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is for Mike and it's on the U.S. benefit plan, I guess, some of the optionality you've maybe created there. And you mentioned lump sums and perhaps some other alternatives. It sounds like to me that would probably eliminate some of the interest rate sensitivity you've seen around the pension expense and also maybe mitigate it. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly as a positive. And I guess, I don't want to call it a negative, but presumably this would also come with a cost, and would doing a lump sum or a close-out or that type of thing create a meaningful near-term use of cash?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start, Ryan and then I'll hand over to Mike. I think it's too premature to consider the cost of buyouts, et cetera, because we haven't determined yet whether we would offer a discount, if any, to the actual carrying costs that we have for those benefits. And so, we're at the early stages of working through those issues. We think that structurally setting up the two plans make it easier for us to address things like annuity buyouts and lump sum arrangements in an overall derisking effort for our inactives. But overall, I'll hand to Mike to see if he's got additional color. So, Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer","Dan, you're exactly right. It takes a lot of time and effort at different stages to go through in looking at any major or substantial change to a defined benefit program. So we've actually been looking at the changes that may be inherent in the U.S. DB plan for a number of years, did the administrative work and then implemented the change to basically separate the DB plan into two separate plans, one active and one inactive. As Dan indicated, this is just a step along the road and we haven't made a decision on the timing of when to offer lump sum buyouts or annuity purchases. This will come in the future.","The other thing that, Ryan, I would just put into context for you, the U.S. is our second largest plan. The U.K. is by far our largest plan, and then after the U.S. is followed by Canada and Ireland. We actually made some changes in Ireland as well. So, this is more of a long-term philosophical approach to organize all of our plans on a geographic basis, but do it within a common umbrella that Dan and the management team have established.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And then I guess just shifting gears to exchanges. I think you mentioned that next year, despite 40% plus enrollee growth, not expected to be a contributor to earnings. And I guess just to get a better understanding of how that's impacting consulting margins, how does that roughly compare to the contribution of exchanges this year to the bottom line?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start with that and then I'll hand it over to Julio. I think the important thing to note is when we're looking at our exchange, the most important thing to us now is creating a platform and a framework for us to handle a lot of lives and to grow on a rapid but pretty consistent basis for many years to come. And so it really is all about creating the right quality organization. And I was quite pleased when I saw some of the survey data from clients of ours who've used our call center, and their satisfaction levels which were in the upper 90%'s and were even an improvement on last year. But you know for us in early stages you have to look at this as really a startup organization in some ways. And from that perspective, it's not going to be meaningful to earnings, at least on a MMC basis, for quite a while. And so, I just specifically wanted us to comment on it because I see some notes from time to time out there which just seemed to me that some folks might be getting ahead of themselves a little bit, and so we wanted to make some specific comments. But Julio, do you want to add to that?","Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,","Not too much more to add, Dan. I think that was well answered. But in the context of overall MMC, $13 billion revenue, and then you think about the approximate $4.4 billion of revenue of Mercer, and then you think about the $1.5 billion global revenue we have in H&B, in context, this is clearly a growth strategy for us. And we are wearing the results within the P&L results of Mercer. And we will continue to do that, and I think that we have demonstrated that we can manage that in the context of the improvements that we've had in our margin over the last several years now. So, we'll continue to do that in time-and-time. And by the way, there are other things we invest in too, that we also wear inside the Mercer results and we'll continue to do that as well.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's really a great position to be in, to be able to deliver significant margin improvement in both RIS and in Consulting, while we're investing in those businesses and while we're acquiring in those businesses, and wearing higher amortization and deal costs, et cetera, et cetera. Next question, please.","Operator","Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. So I don't want to turn this into an exchange conversation, we've been through this before. But if you just walk through the process \u2013 and I think we've been through it in some places \u2013 on a current customer, if they choose to go onto your exchange, where do you lose revenues? Where do you gain revenues? And how do we see that come through the P&L?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, a couple of things. One, half of the new clients that we had on the exchange this year were actually new H&B clients from Mercer, so that is an improvement over last year and shows the draw of the actual concept of an exchange. As Julio has mentioned before, our anticipation over a long period of time would be that when it's fully up and running, at scale, et cetera, that the likely exchange type of margin would be similar to the H&B margins that we have in a regular transaction; of course, supplemented and supported by the voluntary benefits programs that we sell through the exchange. And so, overall, I think it's way premature to even consider the margins. This is off into the future in terms of what our expectations are. And I can just tell you that when I look at overall Consulting margins, I'm quite satisfied. And for us, the exchange is a growth opportunity rather than an earnings opportunity at this stage. Do you have any other question, Josh?","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So for those new \u2013 I'm just surprised, I guess; not that it has to be significant \u2013 but of those new customers coming on aren't creating additional high-revenue margin, ultimately. It's always \u2013 the P&L \u2013 we've been over this about two years, I guess. The P&L seems in miss years (37:45), it seems like you are adding customers, you've already invested in the systems, I guess. I'm just surprised \u2013 there doesn't have to be a big contribution \u2013 but I'm surprised it would be a flat-to-negative contributor on profitability, I guess, at this point.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I would say a couple things to look at that. One, January 1 is the renewal date for the 2016 plans, and so, the statistics that Mercer released in their press release in October relate to 2016 and not to 2015. And also, this is a build-mode. This is about acquiring clients, marketing well, serving clients well, being able to handle large amounts of incoming. And so it's not just-in-time inventory of people and capabilities. I mean, that will be more how it operates several years down the road. But right now, this is a build, not a just add on. Next question, please.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. And first, congratulations to both Mike and Mark. My first question is on the foreign exchange impact. It looks like it's bigger than you anticipated at the beginning of the year. If currencies stay the same as today, do you see currency also a meaningful headwind for you to return to your 13% EPS long-term goal in 2016?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No. So Kai, when we look over periods of time, like 10 years or 20 years, within the company, foreign exchange has been a wash. And when we look at Marsh & McLennan and our footprint around the world, we are very much a global business and so foreign exchange is a part of our reported results. And we've got to wear foreign exchange.","I think when you look back over the last few years, we were wearing $0.03, $0.04 per year of foreign exchange headwind and we didn't whine about it. We delivered 13%-plus EPS growth while wearing that kind of headwind. This year is remarkable. I mean, the spike of the strengthening dollar in this year really caught everyone by surprise and was shocking in its ascent. So in terms of this year, there was just no way to operate the company in a proper way without pulling back expense levers, incorrectly, I would say.","But as we look forward, if we look at next year, if we return to the regular $0.03 or $0.04, $0.05 kind of headwind that we've had in past years, it shouldn't disrupt our ability to get back to our strong levels of EPS growth that we've been used to. I would just add for this year, it's about a six points of EPS growth has been lost to foreign exchange and so the delivery of 8% year-to-date on EPS growth is, in my view, a remarkable achievement for the company. Do you have anything else, Kai?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Second question on capital management, looks like you're already exceeding your $2.3 billion total capital management in 2014. You mentioned that you're going to basically third quarter, pulling forward fourth quarter and first quarter of next year buybacks. I just wonder are we going to see a meaningful decrease in buybacks and overall, if you think about your total capacity for capital returns, is the $2.3 billion still a runway annual number or you still has some excess cash capacity including debt as well as excess cash position that could be on top of that?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So as we outlined on Investor Day, we anticipated that we were going to be returning higher levels of capital to shareholders because we knew that we would have higher cash flows from operations, we were reducing cash on the balance sheet and we had declining calls on our cash and we also intended to increase our leverage while remaining prudent. And right now, our corporate debt to EBITDA is around 1.6 times, so I would say it's well within the level that we're comfortable with.","And so this year, for a variety of different reasons \u2013 acquisitions have run at least on a year-to-date basis a little bit higher than what we had been doing the past couple of years and last year was a pretty big year as well. And so, doing $2.4 billion through nine months with the anticipation of our transaction with Jelf which is already announced and should happen within the next two to three months, combined with the idea that we pay out our bonuses in the first quarter and so we tend to be more cash light in the first quarter than in other quarters, I would say that you will see less share buyback certainly in the fourth quarter and most likely in the first quarter as well than what we've done this year. And when I look forward to next year, I think that 2016 probably looks a little bit more like 2014 \u2013 $2.3 billion kind of number sounds about right for return of capital to shareholders.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","Larry Greenberg, Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital Markets","Thank you, and good morning. Just wondering if Alex could comment a little bit on the reinsurance market? Some have pointed to a reduction in third party capital this year into this sector and just the absolute level of prices in certain segments of the reinsurance business is maybe signaling that at least things aren't getting as bad on the margin and maybe we're about to trough out on where things are?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Alex, you want to take that?","Alexander Moczarski - Chairman; President and Chief Executive Officer, Guy Carpenter & Company LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. So we calculate that is now about dedicated reinsurance capital of $400 billion, of which $66 billion is collateralized and $334 billion is rated. So more or less, $66 billion or $60 billion of alternative capital that's come into the marketplace and clearly, it's had its effect on rates and also on terms and conditions as the traditional reinsurers have tried to maintain market share.","Do we feel that it's troughing out? We certainly are seeing some signs \u2013 I wouldn't call hardening \u2013 I'd say less softening than we've seen in the past. Frankly, the collateralized products and traditional reinsurance products are pretty much at the same price right now, sort of competing at the bottom, perhaps. So, there are signs that it's harder to place business than it was a year ago, but those are very, very pale signs.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In a lot of ways, Larry, it's tougher to be a reinsurance capital provider than a reinsurance broker. Because for us, it's not about the premium per se, it's about the value we create; and in tough environmental markets like this, companies want and need advice and we're there to provide innovative solutions to help them cope with these difficult market conditions.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Capital Markets","Great. Thank you. And I, too, want to congratulate Mike on just an outstanding career and best wishes in the future.","J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer","Ah, thanks, Larry.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In the Consulting business, it's been a great story in terms of strong organic growth and margin expansion. Where do you think the margins in the Consulting business could head over time?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's a good question. I start with an easy answer \u2013 higher than they are today \u2013 as I'm looking at Julio and Scott because they're the ones who have to deliver it on the ground. But overall, our margin story in Consulting has been pretty consistent over the last several years. And when you look at Consulting overall as a division in 2012, they delivered 150 bps of growth; in 2013, 160 bps; in 2014, 160 bps, and year-to-date 90 bps. In a lot of ways, our focus is more on earnings and growing our net operating income and that's how we're geared as a company and focusing on our output. And margin in a lot of ways is one of those outputs.","We have an approach in the company in both Consulting and in RIS that revenue growth should almost always exceed expense growth. And then when that doesn't happen, we want it to be our choice; so we're making specific investment decisions in a quarter or two \u2013 and we call that being upside-down \u2013 and whenever we're upside-down we expect to get right-side up in the very near future, and so we have a consistent approach.","But when we look at the work that we've done throughout our Consulting division, in part, it is a focus on a mix of business issue which favors our higher margin parts of the business. But as I was saying earlier, we are investing actively in things like MMX and others which pull down the margin of the Consulting division, but we're making the right decisions about investing with today's money and today's earnings to drive better opportunities for us in the future.","Do you have another question, Sarah?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. And then just circling back on the private health exchanges, how large does that business need to be in terms of lives before it becomes a contributor to earnings?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't know if we even have that answer, but I'm going to hand over to Julio because I think maybe a broader discussion around exchanges are in order. And I say that I don't even know if we have the answer because I know I don't know the answer and I have not pressed the business for it because I think it's so premature. At the end of the day, our focus on the exchange is not earnings and hasn't been earnings over the last few years. And so we're in a terrific position to be able to build the business without the pressure of delivering earnings today. And so, I think the overall focus of the leadership team on the exchange business is making sure we're positioned to capture the full opportunity over a multi-year basis. But Julio, do you want to add to it a bit?","Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,","Yeah. Well, Dan, thank you. Mercer Marketplace is certainly an important contributor to our growth in the health business and will continue to be so for some time to come. We think that over time, it will continue to be the type of business we want to invest in, make sure that our clients have that option as we think through the strategies that they are thinking about for their benefits. And that's a very important distinction, right, because we are trusted advisors; strategy-first discussions with many of our clients take place all the time. And some have concluded that Mercer Marketplace is the right place for them to be able to maximize the desired outcome that they have for broader employee choice, a quality colleague experience, flexibility and savings. That continues to be the case and we will continue to invest because it will give us that kind of revenue uplift. And ultimately, it's what our clients want. If we end up with those discussions being this option, we want to be there for them. So as you know, in total, the exchange now serves over 700,000 employees and retirees, and with a projected exchange access for an anticipated 1.5 million lives. We're pretty pleased with that and we'll continue to invest.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I guess, just to round out the question on earnings and why we're not focused on earnings. Because in our overall size of company and overall earnings growth, it just doesn't matter. When something is not contributing to earnings, the first year it does, it contributes to earnings. So what's that number look like? And then the year after that, let's say it doubles its earnings for a couple years in a row. It's still relative to our overall size of Mercer, let alone the size of Marsh & McLennan Companies, just not big enough to get the level of attention on earnings that it may generate. But next question, please?","Operator","Vinay Misquith at Sterne Agee.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi, good morning. The first question is on margins and the RIS segment. Those expanded about 130 basis points year-to-date this year. Curious about how much you can expand margins when the organic growth slows to the 2% to 3% range, given that we're at pretty high margins right now?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, it's a fair question. And I would say that when we look at the company overall, we're pretty satisfied with our margins. But again, we have a discipline about growing our revenue faster than growing our expenses, and so we will consistently see margin expansion going out into the future. It has not been a one or two or three year story in RIS with regard to margins. We are in the eighth consecutive year of margin expansion in RIS. And just as a reminder, even though we were talking about margins in 2011 and 2012 about, can you grow margins any more, you've come so far since 2008? We grew RIS margins 120 bps in 2012, 150 bps in 2013, 30 bps last year, we're at 130 bps year-to-date. So we have demonstrated an ability over a long period of time of growing margins. And where we sit today, and obviously we don't control all the macro factors, but we feel pretty comfortable that we will be able to expand margins into the future. And certainly, when we look at 2016 we would expect to see margin expansion in both segments.","But as we've said before, margins are one of the last things we look about. We think about our organic growth, our level of organic investment to build a better company and support future levels of organic growth. We look at our earnings and whether we're growing NOI and delivering value for our clients and shareholders on that score. And then we look at margins; and margins to us is more of an outcome than anything else. We would gladly give up a bit of margin for faster levels of organic growth and when we see those opportunities, we'll take those opportunities.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you. And the second question is around the debt. You mentioned that you pulled forward some debt issuance from next year, but your debt to EBITDA is only 1.6x. Are you planning on raising more debt next year and keeping the leverage ratio the same next year versus this year?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll hand it to Mike in a second, but I would say yes, we're at 1.6 but we were at 1.1. So ultimately in the last \u2013 well, if I just look at it from year-to-date last year, how we finished the year \u2013 ultimately when we think about debt we've got $1.1 billion of more debt than we had at year-end of 2014 and $600 million less of cash. So we obviously are flexing in different ways. And we've had levels of corporate debt to EBITDA over the last 25 years everywhere from say a one, two or three or three-and-a-quarter, and within that range we would be comfortable, depending on what factors were existing at that point in time.","So I wouldn't say that we're targeting 1.6 or any other corporate debt to EBITDA at this point in time. We maintain a prudent approach. And what I could say is that it would be unlikely that we would create more leverage only to buy back more shares but certainly other opportunities, both organic and acquisition-related, would be more likely that that would generate more leverage. But, Mike, you want to add to that?","J. Michael Bischoff - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dan, what I'll say \u2013 I would just add a few things. We always look for balance on everything, and so it's a balance with regard to leverage, with regard to the growth opportunities we see. But we don't begin by looking at it as just at leverage. We look at the operating cash flows and the growth of the company, and then we think, okay, what's a normalized level of debt to accompany the growth that we're looking at and those very strong operating cash flows?","But the other thing we look at is really, what is our refinancing risk and what's our liquidity? And as I indicated in my remarks, we've spent really, the better part of three-and-a-half years reshaping our debt maturity ladder so that we do not have any major towers coming against us in any one year, and in fact, over the next four or five years, we have very small amounts of debt coming due. And so we've created a situation where the debt maturity ladder is very nice, which gives us a little bit more flexibility if an opportunity presents itself.","The other thing I would say is I kind of look at it as an interest expense budget, so to speak, and that's why we also talked about, at $3 billion of debt a number of years ago, our interest expense on an annual basis was about $200 million. You look at the $4.5 billion today, and it's actually less than $170 million, but if you throw in the cost of commercial paper and the revolver, that's why I said it's in the neighborhood of $170 million to $175 million. So we look at it many different ways, not just leverage, but we think we have a lot of flexibility and if an opportunity presents itself in the future, as Dan indicated, we can take advantage of it.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, operator?","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I just had one quick question first on the private healthcare exchanges. I was wondering if you can break down the enrollment between those that chose the self- versus the fully-insured option. And I guess how does that compare to what you saw last year as well as your expectations?","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks. Julio, do you want to take that?","Julio A. Portalatin - President & Chief Executive Officer, Mercer LLC,","Sure. Thank you for the question. In the fully insured and self-insured, we're really not seeing people make conscious decisions to change from what they have traditionally already been implementing. So if they were fully insured before, they tend to stay fully insured, and if they're self-insured, they tend to stay self-insured. So as an example, I will show you that based on the clientele that we accumulated in our first year of 2014, it was 75% fully insured\/25% self-insured and in 2015 it was 60% fully insured and 40% self-insured, and in 2016 it's about the same: 57% fully insured and 43% self-insured.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the Marsh Agency business and how that has been a contributor to the margin expansion there and whether or not given the size, being as you said $900 million in revenue now, that we might be able to get to see that as a separate broken out line item, given that $900 million kind of falls in the size of your other discrete line item businesses. Thanks.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Charles, I'm glad you got the last question because I had all the series of exchange questions for Julio and meanwhile we've got this $900 million business that we've invested in for the last seven years, but Peter, do you want to take that and talk a little bit about the Agency?","Peter Zaffino - Chairman - Risk & Insurance Services and President & Chief Executive Officer - Marsh, LLC, Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure, and in terms of its contribution to margin, as Dan mentioned in his opening comments, we're wearing the amortization for the acquisition. So while it is a contributor, that is certainly going to be a headwind for the short run. The revenue that we had mentioned on $900 million is the estimated annualized as we hit into next year, so that's not what is actually being earned this year. But if I step back, Marsh & McLennan Agency is hitting on all cylinders. We have acquired the highest quality agencies across the United States, now created substantial hubs within California and Texas. Our pipeline is as strong as it's been for spokes and fold-ins, so we'll be able to expand our business and be more dense in areas that we want to expand. And its organic growth engine has been terrific this year and it's been very balanced. We've had growth within property and casualty and employee health and benefits and believe that will continue. So overall, incredibly pleased with what we've acquired, what we're building, how they're coming together as a leadership team and we're very optimistic for the future.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","How does pricing compare this year on \u2013 the pipeline you said is very strong \u2013 on what's going on relative to last year? It seems to be a very competitive market in that business.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I would say overall, I don't think it's very much different this year to last year, it is a competitive market, but I would say the difference is really when you look back four or five years ago, the multiples were lower than they are today, so it's very important for us to understand that. One of our focuses is on quality and history of good performance and stability of the leadership team, the chemistry, all of those other factors become more important as we evaluate agencies versus each other and determine which ones should be a part of Marsh & McLennan Agency. It's also very important for us to really come to an understanding of what the EBITDA really is. That may be even more important than multiple because these are largely all private companies, and so there is a pro forma aspect of figuring out what EBITDA is, and it takes some skill in determining what is ongoing EBITDA. And so, I think there may be some players out there that might get the multiple right but they get the EBITDA wrong. We want to be right on both the EBITDA and the multiple.","Daniel S. Glaser - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I think that just about does it. We've passed our one hour commitment. And I'd like everyone for joining us this morning. I'd particularly like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them.

","I'll now turn this over to Mr. Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO. ","Before I continue, I'd like to thank Mike for serving as CFO as we search for a permanent replacement. With Mike's vast knowledge and experience, we have not missed a beat. ","Also I'd like to welcome 3 of our operating companies' CEOs: Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Unfortunately, Peter Zaffino of Marsh could not be with us today due to a death in his family. ","Following my comments, Dan will discuss our operating results in more detail. Mike will then update you on our financial position. ","Our strong first quarter results are a terrific start to the year. Across all our businesses, we saw revenue growth and higher levels of profitability. Underlying revenue growth of 6%, combined with ongoing control of expenses, resulted in growth of 12% in adjusted operating income and 13% growth in adjusted earnings per share. This performance is consistent with our long-term plan to produce double-digit earnings growth. ","Risk and Insurance Services had an excellent revenue growth. Revenue increased 7% on both a reported and underlying basis. ","Marsh produced another strong quarter, generating underlying revenue growth of 7% with all major geographies contributing. This growth was driven by both higher client retention, revenue retention rates and new business development. Guy Carpenter also produced 7% underlying revenue growth, driven by its international operations. ","The Consulting segment delivered excellent performance in the quarter as well, producing solid revenue growth on both a reported and underlying basis. Mercer generated underlying revenue growth of 4% and Oliver Wyman's growth was 6%. Importantly, Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 24%, reflecting double-digit growth at both Mercer and Oliver Wyman. ","We're pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates that we are fulfilling the strategic priority of generating consistent long-term growth in both revenue and earnings that we articulated at Investor Day some 20 months ago. Our long-term growth allows us to continuously improve performance while investing back in our businesses to enhance our competitive position. These investments include value-added products and technology for clients, cutting-edge analytical capabilities and innovative processes, which allow us to become more efficient. ","Even more important, as a professional services firm, growth allows us to invest in our colleagues, the foundation of our success. As we grow the company, the opportunities for our colleagues grow as well. The work becomes more intellectually stimulating, the environment more vibrant and there's pride in working for the company. And as our strong performance continues, growth becomes a virtuous circle that builds on itself. Growth becomes a powerful force that's good for clients, good for colleagues and good for our shareholders. It's an exciting place to be. ","And with that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our first quarter results.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, Marsh & McLennan's excellent performance continued. We generated significant growth in underlying revenues, which, combined with effective expense control, produced double-digit growth in both adjusted operating income and earnings per share. The first quarter sets the stage for the rest of the year, so we are pleased that each of our operating companies generated strong results and are off to a good start. ","Risk and Insurance Services revenue increased 7%, a very strong performance. In fact, 7% is the highest underlying revenue growth rate we have generated in a decade. Profitability increased at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income increased to $415 million and the adjusted operating margin for the segment improved 40 basis points in the first quarter. ","As I've said in the past, we are continuously investing in our businesses. We seek high-value initiatives that support growth and have effectiveness and efficiency and ultimately strengthen our competitive position. ","Marsh produced another strong quarter. Revenue increased 8% to $1.4 billion. Underlying revenue rose 7%. This growth was across the board with all geographies contributing, including notable growth in the U.S.\/Canada division of 6%. ","And in Marsh's International division, growth was 18% in Latin America, 10% in Asia Pacific and 5% in EMEA. We are pleased with the growth in the International division considering the very strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific in last year's first quarter. ","Marsh's excellent growth reflects the continuation of outstanding new business development. We are very pleased that client revenue retention rates improved across the board, reaching the highest level since the first quarter of 2003. ","Guy Carpenter continued to produce strong results. Revenue in the first quarter increased 5% to $357 million. Underlying revenue growth of 7% was driven by Carpenter's international operations, including strong growth from global specialties, Continental Europe and Asia Pacific. Carpenter's revenue growth reflects its highest level of first quarter new business development since 2003. ","This strong growth now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter\u2019s quarterly underlying revenue growth into the fourth consecutive year. ","Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, a 4% increase on both the reported and underlying basis. One of our strategic initiatives is to increase the level of profitability within Consulting. Our first quarter results indicate that we're off to an excellent start. By creating greater linkage between underlying revenue growth and expense growth, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to Consulting's double-digit growth in earnings and a higher operating margin. ","Adjusted operating income rose 24% to $162 million. The adjusted operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.4%. ","Mercer\u2019s first quarter revenue was $957 million, an increase of 4% on both a reported and underlying basis. We had particularly strong growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Canada. ","Looking at Mercer's underlying revenue by line of business: Investments grew 7%; Health & Benefits increased 6%; Talent, Rewards & Communications rose 5%; Outsourcing increased 4% and Retirement was flat. ","Julio Portalatin joined us as Mercer\u2019s CEO in February and he hit the ground running, bringing a new vitality, business acumen and expense discipline to Mercer. ","Oliver Wyman's revenue increased 5% to $356 million. The timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance provisions occurred earlier than last year, primarily within Financial Services. This represented slightly less than 1\/2 of Oliver Wyman's 6% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. Oliver Wyman saw strong revenue growth in the Consumer and the Health & Life Sciences sectors. ","Health & Life Sciences is an important long-term growth sector for Oliver Wyman as health care companies face enormous challenges. Changes impact payers, providers and pharmaceutical companies alike. Over each of the past 2 years, revenue from Health & Life Sciences has grown double digits and is Oliver Wyman's fastest-growing sector. ","In conclusion, we are very pleased with the growth throughout each of our operating companies. This is an excellent start to the year. ","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. As Brian and Dan have discussed, the company has continued to deliver excellent financial performance. ","Consolidated revenue was $3.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 6% on both a reported and underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 12% to $530 million, and the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 17.4%. ","On a GAAP basis, net income was $347 million or $0.63 per share. Adjusted earnings per share was also $0.63. This represents growth of 13% from the prior year. ","Since Dan has already covered the details of our results by operating segment, let's move on to a few other areas. During the quarter, we refinanced a $250 million 6 1\/4% senior note that was maturing. We took advantage of low interest rates to secure a rate of 2.3% for the new $250 million 5-year senior note. ","Our next debt maturity, also $250 million, is in February of next year and we have taken additional steps over the past year to improve the financial performance of the company. Last July, we successfully completed a $600 million tender and refinancing that extended our debt maturity ladder and reduced interest expense. ","In November, we closed a $1 billion 5-year revolving credit facility with lower rates that replaced our 3-year credit facility, which was scheduled to mature later this year. These transactions increased our financial flexibility, refined our capital structure, lowered our refinancing risk, extended maturities of our debt portfolio, slightly delevered our balance sheet and lowered interest expense. ","Corporate expense in the first quarter was $48 million, which is higher than normal. The primary reason for this is that certain members of our senior management team became eligible for retirement this year. As a result, their equity grants and stock options, including those granted this year, must be expensed over several months instead of over the normal 3- or 4-year time period. ","This will have an even greater impact to corporate expense in the second quarter. But after that, corporate expense should return to a more normalized level. ","Investment income this quarter was $20 million compared with $19 million in the first quarter last year. In the second quarter, we anticipate that investment income will be approximately $5 million, compared with an investment loss of $6 million in the second quarter of last year. ","Now turning to capital management. Cash utilization is typically the greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Our cash position at the end of March exceeded $1.4 billion compared with $1.3 billion a year ago. ","Other uses of cash in the quarter included discretionary pension contributions of $100 million into our U.S. plan and $100 million into our U.K. plan. Dividends were $121 million in the first quarter. And for acquisitions, we spent $73 million, the largest of which was Alexander Forbes. ","At the end of the first quarter, net debt was $1.5 billion compared with $1.7 billion a year ago. ","With that, I'm very happy to turn it back to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you, Mike. Operator, we are ready for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No question the top line looks exceptional, but I guess the question is if I think about the organic growth, the implied expense growth is pretty substantial as well. And why is that, especially with higher-margin Guy Carpenter up, you're pretty much up across the board especially in some of the international businesses where it's higher-margin, I would have expected the margin to be a lot higher. If you could just talk to that.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, I think Dan ought to take that. Dan?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. First of all, I'd start with the overall company. And the overall company's margin improved by 100 basis points in the quarter, so it's a good quarter from a margin perspective. In RIS, we had over 9% growth in adjusted operating income, and as you stated, margins were up 40 basis points. Now the important thing is a couple of things: one, we're confident that we will continue to improve margins in that we are on a path over time to continue to improve RIS' margins as well as Consulting's margins. Now you can always squeeze out a bit more margin in any one quarter, but our leadership team is very much focused on investing consistently and really constantly to not only invest for the future but deliver good results today. It's important to remember, though, that investing while it's a constant, it's not necessarily consistent quarter-to-quarter. It impacts us in different ways and there's moving parts along there. And I'll just give you a little bit of background on some of the things we're doing in the RIS segment. I mean, right off the bat, we've been investing pretty actively in both Guy Carpenter and Marsh in strategic recruitment over the past several years. In March alone, since 2008, we've added almost 450 senior vice presidents and managing directors to the firm and 115 in 2011. So that is rolling in. Also, we're laying the groundwork in our RIS segment for some pretty strong operational improvement, which would help us improve client service while capturing some of our scale, so we really do think that we're investing for better efficiency in the future. That will take multiple quarters, really even 2 or 3 years before we fully manifest the benefits of that. We've created several centers of excellence for Marsh recently around analytics. So for cat modeling, for risk economics, for benchmarking, some of the things that Peter really learned at Guy Carpenter and built at Guy Carpenter, we're building some of the things within Marsh and obviously that costs some money.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just the second question. The top line just significantly higher than what I had in the model and I would have thought, thinking about you guys as a fee -- primarily a fee business, especially in the U.S., why are you seeing that kind of growth? Can you -- are you getting lift on fees that you're charging customers? Can you just give a little more color around that because it seems like it's a lot higher than I would have thought.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, so there's really 4 factors that are generating our good growth in RIS and in Marsh, in particular. So the #1 factor is improved client revenue retention, which, as we mentioned in the script, is at its highest level since 2003. Now client revenue retention, there's a lot of things that go into client revenue retention, including the outcome of fee discussions or commission discussions with carriers. It's all in the revenue retention line and so that is the leading reason behind the growth. The second leading reason is new business. New business was up 9% in Marsh. As we mentioned on -- in the script, Guy Carpenter had its highest new business first quarter since 2003. The third reason is pricing trends. So pricing trends are complicated. We could probably spend the whole hour talking about pricing, so I don't want to do that. But I would say that property rates are being impacted more than casualty rates. And if you look at the U.S. property, workers' comp, excess casualty are all up moderately. General liability and D&O are still slightly down. If you look at the National Brokerage segment, which is our upper middle market and middle market, it's all up moderately across the board. In International, EMEA is flat to down, Asia Pacific was up in cat property and flat to down in non-cat and Latin America is flat to down except in cat. So from a pricing standpoint, it's not a headwind, but I wouldn't call it a tailwind either. You have to really look at, well, what geography are you talking about, what line of business are you talking about. It's very segmented and since we participate across all of those segments, it's muted from our perspective. And the fourth area that underpinned our strong growth and it's in that sort of order in terms of the impact, the fourth area is exposure unit. So both from a total insurable value and from a payroll standpoint, both were mildly higher. So, overall, just talking about Marsh specifically for a second because I think it demonstrates the broad strength of the growth, it was very well distributed. Every region had a growth rate better than the fourth quarter and better than their run rate for the full year 2011. We had 22 countries with greater than 15% underlying growth and 30 countries with greater than 10% growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","On the Consulting margin, my memory serves that you had been a bit more focused on improving the profitability in Europe; that, that was a priority. Is that perhaps what's driving the bigger part of the Consulting margin improvement? Then, secondly, Dan, you mentioned the revenue associated with, I can't remember exactly what you called it, early acceptances helping the Oliver Wyman number. Is that something that's going to negatively impact prospective quarters?","Brian Duperreault","Okay. Dan, why don't you take the first piece and John can talk about the...","Daniel S. Glaser","Perfect. So in terms of -- as we've mentioned before, we're committed to improving the Consulting segment margins over the next 2 to 3 years. So from that standpoint, we'll very much align expense growth to be lower than revenue growth and in that way we'll improve the margin. I'm not sure where the European focus came from, but it really doesn't stand out as a particular area that we have to improve the Consulting margins. I mean we're generally looking to do that across the board. Many of our Consulting businesses run as much on a line of business global basis as they do on a geographic basis so you can't fix one without the other. So we're doing both at this time.","Brian Duperreault","John, if you take the other piece.","John P. Drzik","Sure. So over the past few years, procurement departments for Oliver Wyman's larger clients have become more heavily involved in contract negotiations and this has led to general acceptance criteria being added into contracts for certain Oliver Wyman projects. These acceptance provisions create situations where revenue for work delivered in early parts of the year were reported as revenue in later quarters once those acceptance criteria were met. Based on an analysis of our experience with these acceptance provisions, we're now able to better align our reported revenue with the timing of project delivery. So as Dan noted, our reported results for Q1 includes the impact of this improved alignment, which did result in higher year-over-year growth in the first quarter and represented a little less than half of our underlying revenue growth in the quarter. And to your question, Larry, it would then play out that the growth later in the year would be lower because of the same effect and probably most principally in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. First, just quickly, back in the question from Larry. The Oliver Wyman revenues, was there any impact on margins also in the quarter in Consulting from that timing on revenues?","Brian Duperreault","John?","John P. Drzik","Yes, there was some impact, but it wasn't significant and the Consulting margin growth would have continued to be -- or the profit growth would have been 20% or more. But it did have a positive effect of some amount.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, Brian, I wonder if you could talk about just thoughts on Europe and impacting business. It doesn't seem like the weakness in Europe is having much of an impact on your business right now.","Brian Duperreault","I think it is having an impact, certainly it's having some impact on Oliver Wyman, particularly in the Financial Services component. It would have some impact -- we're in recession in parts of Europe so exposures will be down. So I wouldn't diminish it, but I think the interesting thing is, take Oliver Wyman, they're -- they've been able to really improve in the U.S., counterbalancing that. So I think it basically highlights the benefits of having a global structure and being able to take advantage of the areas where we have significant growth and Dan pointed them out. But, Julio, do you want to comment a little bit?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, I would love to. Thanks, Brian. We saw a low- to mid-single digit growth in the U.K. and the broader Europe and the continent and although the macros in Europe, of course, are challenging and you just have to read the newspapers to see that, our sales activity still remains pretty strong. And as you know, we have a pretty balanced portfolio at Mercer. It's a pretty global operation for us. We look at this as geographically and by line of business. And if you note that 70% of our revenue is pretty much reoccurring revenue in Retirement, Outsourcing and Benefits area, especially Investments as well, we've had a solid base of renewal business as well. So if Europe continues to worsen, of course it affects everybody, but that's why it's important for us to maximize our global footprint and ensure that all areas are really achieving their objectives and continuing to move on all cylinders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","With regards to market conditions in the P&C space, what I've been hearing a lot is that it's an income statement-driven marketing transition. So first, do you agree with that? And then if you do, what do you think would the outcome be for the market if this turned out to be a benign year in terms of weather events?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I'll start by saying it's always great to try to characterize these. I mean they all have to have a name, I guess, what this market is. I mean the one thing is it's always a little different. Is it a hard market? I think not in the definitions we would apply. I think Dan pointed out that maybe there's some benefit in some areas for the carriers in terms of rate, but it's not across the board, and there are lines of business where rates are going down. Whole geographies where rates are down except for cat. So I don't know what you would call it. For us, it's just the market. That's the market we're in. But, Dan, you wanted to add anything?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I would just -- we don't -- we've been in the business here a long time and market cycles, our brokerage and risk management advisors work through the cycles and the cycles tend to be more downward pressure than upward pressure and so we don't -- we build our business around that fact. When we look at this, generally, the market follows levels of losses and the levels of losses have been specific to geography and specific to lines of business, so it's a pretty targeted correction of rates in certain areas, but not a broad-based \"blood in the eye\" hard market where underwriters are, en masse, walking away from clients. I mean we don't see that. There's still competition for new business. There's still innovation in the insurance market. And so overall, it's a market which doesn't have a tremendous amount of conviction in either direction.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then looking ahead to the summer on the Consulting front, what would the impact, best case\/worst case scenario, be of the Supreme Court decision regarding health care reform for Mercer?","Brian Duperreault","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, let me comment on that, if I may. The Health & Benefits business continues to be an evolving business in the U.S. and if you look at it, to a certain extent, also globally. Here, of course, with the Supreme Court's spending decision on individual mandate or maybe even more of an impact across the board, we're well positioned really for all types of outcomes depending on how the Supreme Court rules. And we've got significant amount of activity taking place, for example, in the private exchanges. We've got good activity taking place globally, again reminding everyone this -- we have a global business with our H&B where a lot of things are happening. And we're investing appropriately to make sure that whatever outcome comes out of the U.S. portion of that we're well positioned, and we believe we are.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the first quarter, we saw much faster earnings growth in the Consulting business than RIS and I'd like to get your directional thoughts as to whether you think that trend will continue.","Brian Duperreault","Dan?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. Well, one, we made up a lot of ground in RIS over a number of years and we've really expanded our margins, so the pace of margin improvement in Consulting is not a surprise to us because Consulting had reduced margins through the economic downturn and now is recovering from that. When we look at our overall focus is on long-term delivering 10% or better improvement in adjusted operating income and that's our first thing, is growing profitability. Secondarily, we focus on margin. But as I was saying before, margin can be a little bit of a fool's game. You can get the margin you want and it actually hurt your business over a mid- and long term, and so we're very much focused on continuing to invest in our business as we go forward. When I look at the Consulting business in general, when you look over the last few years, the adjusted margin in Consulting in 2009 was 10.3%, then 11.4%, then 11.8%, so I wouldn't get ahead of ourselves necessarily and say that 200 basis points is the new reality quarter-by-quarter. We look at expenses aligned with revenues so revenue grew by 4%, expenses grew by 2%. That's what gave the big lift. Obviously, our expense growth, when we factor in April 1 raises, will tick up a little bit, which would create a squeeze in that basis point improvement unless we grow the top line more. So our focus, though, in Consulting is growing the margins in a sustainable way and we believe that it will vary quarter-by-quarter, but we'll deliver that margin improvement over the next several years.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, then also just one follow-up. Dan, you gave a really complete overview on what the drivers of the RIS growth and Marsh, in particular. Were those in rank order? Improved client revenue retention, new business pricing, exposure, was that from the greatest benefit to the least?","Daniel S. Glaser","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First quarter obviously a big cash usage quarter for you, but you are sitting on a fair amount of cash in the balance sheet and obviously you'll be seeing that ramp as the year progresses. You've talked about the trade-off in the past of how you think about deploying cash either M&A or repurchase, but I was wondering if you can maybe refresh your thinking there in the trade-off given that we haven't seen repurchase in the last couple of quarters. And then also, maybe some commentary on your view of the M&A environment, pipeline in both Brokerage and Consulting in current deal -- pricing of deals in current environment.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, well, we\u2019re happy to. Yes, we don't -- we have -- simply it's been to have an authorization to buy back shares. We haven't bought them back in the first quarter because, as you cited, it's a high-cash usage quarter. But we certainly have the intent to buy back shares through the year. As Dan, as you pointed out, my priority is always acquisitions, accretive acquisitions, would be the preference because of its growth aspects of that. But we did say that we certainly want to acquire at least enough shares to blunt the dilution from our equity grants that occur. So that runs -- pick a number, $150 million a year or something like that would be the equity grants levels. And so that certainly is something that you should expect us to do through the year. Past that, we certainly will weigh the choices and it\u2019s what's the most accretive use of cash after that. In terms of the acquisition pipeline, we feel good about it. I think we have a lot of very interesting opportunities. Some come to fruition, some don't. We do take a look at a lot of things and I would not limit that to necessarily just the agency business of Marsh. That pipeline is good, but we are looking at some other things. We want to grow our business either by adding components that we don't have, which will enhance the capabilities, sort of our R&D approach, through acquisition or just to increase geography. In Marsh, with the HSBC acquisition and then the price -- the Forbes acquisition, we increased geography significantly. I hope we can find some more like that. We keep looking. So I think growth through acquisition is an important part of our long-term growth and you heard me talk about how we believe in that. So I hope that answers your question, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one for Mike Bischoff. Interest expense, just give us a sense, if you don't mind, for the balance of the year what the quarterly run rate\u2019s going to look like, given the refinancing?","J. Michael Bischoff","Jay, that's a very good question. When we're looking at interest expense, it was about $46 million this quarter and the $250 million refinancing with 4 percentage points off will contribute an additional benefit of about $7 million to $8 million. Because we did that maturity in March, it really did not impact the first quarter, so you'll be looking at about a benefit of $1.5 million to $2 million a quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","I guess maybe a broader question for Julio now that he's been at the company 90, 100 days. Maybe if you could talk about the strengths that you see of the Mercer organization and maybe some of the challenges, if you will, ahead for the near and intermediate term.","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks for that question. I have been here, now today is actually my 3-month anniversary, so just to celebrate that. But over the past 3 months, I've traveled extensively, as you can imagine, and met with large numbers of clients and colleagues and I've been very impressed really with the deepness of the relationships we have with clients and the real added value that comes from our employees and colleagues around the world. I\u2019ve also, as you can imagine, spent quite a lot of time immersing myself in the business itself and all of our financials and some of the things that may come out and pop out as potential opportunities. On balance, I'm very excited about what I've learned so far. Mercer's a strong global company. It has a solid position in all of our major businesses and at the same time, we're also very excited about the potential, notwithstanding our strong position, as I stated. In terms of early decisions, the things that I've been focused on most have been largely internal. However, at the same time, we\u2019ve kicked off a strategic planning process and my goal is that by the end of the second quarter we have a clear perspective of where we want to take Mercer over the next 3 to 5 years. But I must tell you though, as I look at our global footprint, it's really terrific across 40 countries. Maximizing that footprint certainly will be one of the things that we'll be focusing on as we look at the strategic direction of Mercer going forward.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","That's helpful. And then I guess another question for Mike. I mean, stock option expense, I know you said it might tick up, I think, in the second quarter. Did you quantify that, or is there any way you could help us quantify that?","J. Michael Bischoff","If you look at our supplemental schedule on Page 9, you'll see a specific item with regard to stock option expense. And as you recall, this is information that we provide quarterly, so that people can get a better idea not only of the movement there, but some of our noncash items. And you can see in the quarter that it went up by $4 million. We certainly would expect that, while it's not just stock option, it also includes the restricted stock, the total equity awards. And you certainly would -- we expect it to go up an additional $4 million to $5 million in second quarter. And then after that, we will absorb the accelerated amortization and we'll go to a more normalized corporate expense run rate for the third and fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","On ACE's quarterly call, Evan Greenberg noted that some of the data system monetization from the big 2 brokers had started taking root. I was wondering if you could sort of describe that, not necessarily a quantification, but what inning you're in, in terms of expecting revenues from that?","Brian Duperreault","Sure. Okay, well, Dan?","Daniel S. Glaser","A couple of things. One, we do provide market consulting and data analytics to insurers. And basically, those services make insurers more competitive on our clients' business. I mean they get more competitive because they set their appetites more clearly in the business that they want to see, and therefore, their quota submission ratios go up, making them more efficient. And also because they are targeting their submissions, they can have their buy-and-quote ratios improve as well and so that's something that they\u2019re very interested in. Overall, we've described many times and we've been consistent in our approach, that we think that the real issue is carrier revenue streams from -- all carrier revenue streams. And as we've said before, we think that all carrier revenue streams create the potential for conflicts of interest, and so we're very in tune with that and we believe that all brokers receive carrier revenue in one form or another and each of those forms requires a good system of internal systems and controls to make sure that we're managing conflicts properly. At Marsh, we've got many different businesses, many geographies and so there's not a \"one size fits all.\" So from our basis, the most important thing we're committed to is transparency and putting the interest of our clients first. In terms of amounts of money and what inning we're in, this is -- in the aggregate when you look at carrier revenue streams, you look at basic commissionable business as, by far, the biggest part in that will remain, by far, the biggest part. And we're not going to break out individual aspects of carrier revenue streams.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that was helpful. Is there anything analogous on the Consulting side?","Daniel S. Glaser","There is -- the only area that becomes analogous would be in Health & Benefits, and in some parts of the Employee Benefits business we're trying to create the same kind of big data insights to insurance carriers. But that's really where insurance carriers participate on the Consulting side is in EB.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to margins, I believe certain geographies and this is alluded to in the first question on the call, overseas, have higher operating margins, is that correct? And if so, is that one of the main reasons you're confident about improving margin dynamics going forward?","Brian Duperreault","Well, the answer is yes. Different geographies, you have different margins. Particularly in Marsh's International operations, the margins are significantly higher than in the U.S. and so growth rates where margins are higher will always lift it. So no question about that. Is that where you're getting at, Mike?","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, so if we expected growth in Lat Am and certain parts of Asia to continue at a healthy growth rate, then should we expect that dynamic to lift the margin going forward, or is there other underlying things? I know growth is picking up in the U.S. now.","Brian Duperreault","Yes, it's really a scale issue. The size of our U.S. business and our U.K. business, in particular, makes our other regions look fairly small. And so even though we've got better growth and very strong margins, ultimately, it will take quite a while. So you're right and maybe when we're sitting here in 5 and 10 years from now, we'll be able to really view it clearly. But it's going to take a long time to have an impact. The biggest impact is improving our U.K. and U.S. margins as we've done over the last several years and that would have more of an impact on our overall margins.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly in regards to fee versus commission income. In the recent past, Peter who I know is not present today, he's talked about pushing more fee-based business within the Insurance segment. I believe the term he used is a la carte. Does that mean the Insurance segment is less levered to insurance price increases in the current cycle versus the past?","Brian Duperreault","Dan?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, okay. So if you look broadly, first of all, Marsh is about 50-50 between fee and commissionable business. It's weighted toward the U.S. about 60-40 and weighted toward -- in favor of fee and weighted internationally, about 60-40 in favor of commission. What Peter was referring to, the a la carte nature, would be that some of the analytics and modeling and risk consulting that we do apart from the transaction within the Marsh world that we could create fee revenue from those streams as opposed to building it in as a bundled solution for our clients. And so it's not movement of commissionable business to fee business. It's actually just creating additional fee revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just following up on a question before, Brian, about capital deployment, should we think -- should we interpret your position on buybacks to offset dilution as a change in terms of the priority you're giving to buybacks in terms of capital deployment, or is that just kind of a nuance? And just one follow-up.","Brian Duperreault","Thanks. Yes -- no. Nuance might be a better description of it. I mean the priority is accretive acquisitions. That remains, and I hope it always remains that way. But I did want to clarify that we do have an authorization for stock buybacks. We intend to use it. We won't use it every quarter because it may be that an acquisition is there or in the first quarter because we have uses of cash for other -- for our compensation. But I just wanted to make sure everybody understood that there is this commitment to get at least the dilution neutralized and then from there we have to make decisions about accretion and which is a more accretive use of the cash. I suppose there could be a time where we would have a whole year go by because we\u2019d made acquisitions and didn't buy back shares, but there is a desire long-term to do that. I hope that helps.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, it does. And then just one question on the -- you mentioned -- someone on the call mentioned investments that you're making on the expense side. Just trying to think how much do revenues need to rise in order to allow Marsh to meet the overall earnings goal that you kind of outlined in Investor Day, and is the threshold for growth higher now than it was at Investor Day just given the investments you're making on the expense side?","Brian Duperreault","Well, I think Dan talked about that. And I think what we're trying to point out is our goals are long term. Our goals are double-digit growth in profitability. And you've got to be intelligent about how you deploy your resources to ensure that, that long-term goal can be met. And it sometimes means that you have to put monies in investments, which have long-term benefits. You have a return-on-investment criteria that we apply. So it's not that our goals changed. We outlined a pretty simple arithmetic around growth in expense and growth in revenue. And we are mindful of times when we have a higher growth rate, we've got 7% growth rates here. That's a wonderful thing because it gives us the opportunity to invest whereas if we have lower growth rates, like we had in '09 and '10, we have to be intelligent about the investments. Now we still invested, but the opportunities, the ability, the flexibility we have enhances dramatically. And so I thought it was a wonderful thing to be able to take that 7% growth rate and do something with it that will be in the long-term interest of the company. And so that's where we are with it. 10%-plus growth in our earnings is the goal and we are going to continue to do this over a very long period of time, that's the commitment.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And does that imply then that the growth of top line is sort of an enabler for the investing on the expense side and that you'll kind of look to that sort of 10% growth as a goal and hopefully increasing the quality of the earnings base, but kind of managing the expense side given how much room you have to do that and still meet your financial objectives given revenue growth? Is that how should we think about that sort of trade-off?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, that's the art of management. I mean that's the beauty of it. You said it in simple terms. I mean it is a pretty simple thing to do -- I mean to say, harder to execute. And so we're not just going to squeeze out margin and have it drop to the bottom line if instead we could make an investment that is in the best interest of the shareholder long term. So we're going to do the latter. And as I said, it's just flexibility and freedom, and our degrees of freedom are rising. Dan wants to add something.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I would just point out that this is not a quarter-by-quarter thing. It's not that you can manage investments so clearly that you just have it wholly aligned. So you may see some quarters where you'll see bigger margin expansion, as an example, because it\u2019s just not as consistently tied. But what we're painting is what our philosophy is over a mid- and long term and that's what you'll see as our investors stay with us over the 5-year period, 10-year period, they'll see an overall consistency, but it will vary quarter by quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Within Consulting, Health & Benefits and Reward, Talents continue to have relatively good growth rates. Is that more driven by new business or by growth at existing clients?","Brian Duperreault","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes. As you can imagine, a good proportion of our business, overall 70%, is reoccurring revenue, okay? And balance, we really see that as being a strong driver. Now there's been obviously new opportunities. We\u2019ve introduced new concepts to approach the markets, especially in the H&B business. You go around the world, you talk to CEOs about what's on their mind and obviously there's a lot of talent questions in their minds and we're providing solutions in those areas as well. We\u2019ve recently launched the Mercer Marsh Benefits that we think really gives us a excellent foothold in client-facing activities in a common and constructive way. And it's proven to be in the early days pretty expansive in how it's working. So there's a lot of things that are going on that impacts our business positively also on the new business development side. But I'd like to remind again that 70% of our business is reoccurring and that's renewing at very good rate and very good opportunities.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and just one follow-up. Outsourcing also actually had a nice turnaround from the last quarter. Well, I guess, what's driving that?","Julio A. Portalatin","Well, we had some wins in the early part of last year that came on in this quarter. And as a result, we saw some good year-on-year improvement on top line. We continue to be focused on bringing new clients on that side of the business and have some good prospects as well.","Brian Duperreault","I think we're going to end the call at this point. But before I do, there's a couple of things. I want to, first of all, on behalf of all my colleagues, extend our best wishes to Peter Zaffino and his family. And lastly, I do want to end by thanking the 53,000 colleagues around the world for your hard work and dedication, which really makes this such a fun place to be and also thank the clients out there for continuing to support us. And thank you for your interest in the stock, and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","Marsh & McLennan Companies produced another quarter of excellent financial results, generating adjusted operating income growth of 13%. This comes on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of last year.","Our performance in the quarter represents another step forward in our journey to be an elite company. We continue to successfully execute the 4-pillar strategy we first outlined in 2010, which is designed to create sustainable shareholder value.","As a global growth company, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow revenue and earnings. Despite challenging macro conditions, we have consistently delivered underlying revenue growth and produced adjusted EPS growth of 13% in 2011, 16% last year and 17% year-to-date. Over the last few years, we have been relentlessly pursuing efficiency gains, which have funded investments in new technologies, improved data and analytics and client capabilities. Significantly improved operating performance also has allowed us to increase salaries and performance-based compensation. For example, in Risk and Insurance Services, variable compensation has almost doubled in the last 5 years. This includes productivity gains, evidenced by the fact that headcount has increased modestly in RIS, while revenue growth has approached $1 billion over the last 5 years.","In addition to the consistency and strength of our earnings, we expect to see continued growth in cash flows. An increasing portion of our cash flow will be available for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. We believe a balanced approach to deployment of capital will contribute to long-term earnings growth and maximize total return to shareholders.","Looking at our second quarter results in more detail. Underlying revenue growth again exceeded growth in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 20 of the past 21 quarters. In the second quarter, this revenue growth, combined with operating leverage, produced 13% growth in adjusted operating income. And our consolidated margin increased 190 basis points, 19.2%, the highest second quarter margin in 9 years.","Importantly, both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting delivered double-digit growth in adjusted operating income, as well as excellent margin improvement. Risk and Insurance Services produced another excellent quarter. Underlying revenue increased 3% at Marsh and 5% at Guy Carpenter. Adjusted operating income for this segment rose 10%, with the margin expanding to 25.6%, an increase of 170 basis points. This is the segment's highest second quarter margin since 2004.","At Marsh, revenue was $1.4 billion, with all major geographic regions contributing to 3% underlying revenue growth, a solid performance considering it follows a 6% increase in last year's second quarter. New business was $273 million in the quarter.","The International division expanded 3%, led by 10% growth in Latin America. This is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit underlying revenue growth in Latin America in the second quarter. We continue to expand our International operations. In the second quarter, Marsh acquired the leading insurance brokers in Peru and the Dominican Republic. Asia-Pacific and EMEA also contributed to Marsh's underlying revenue growth in the quarter. In the U.S.\/Canada division, 2% underlying growth was the same as the first quarter. This is on top of 5% growth in the first half of last year.","Guy Carpenter also had strong performance, led by its U.S. and international operations. This continues the long-term trend of underlying revenue growth, now at 18 consecutive quarters. Revenue was $285 million in the second quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is even more impressive considering the 10% growth in last year's second quarter, higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions. Guy Carpenter's revenue growth reflects both high revenue retention rates as well as new business development.","Double-digit revenue gains were achieved in Continental Europe and the U.K., consistent with Carpenter's goal of increasing its share outside the U.S. Double-digit increases were also achieved at Carpenter's U.S. and U.K. facultative practices and its marine global specialty practice.","The Consulting segment also produced strong results. In the second quarter, revenue was $1.4 billion, reflecting a rise of 2% on an underlying basis, including growth of 4% at Mercer and a revenue decline at Oliver Wyman. Adjusted underlying expenses were flat, which produced adjusted operating income of $205 million, an increase of 10%. As a result, the segment's margin expanded 120 basis points to 14.6%, which is Consulting's highest second quarter margin since 2004.","At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue in the second quarter decreased 4% to $366 million, an improvement from the first quarter. Oliver Wyman continued to protect its profitability despite the revenue decline. For the balance of the year, we expect to see continued sequential revenue improvement.","Mercer posted strong revenue of $1 billion, an increase of 4% on an underlying basis. Growth was achieved across all geographic regions. Health and investments continue to lead the way, with growth of 6% and 9%, respectively. Retirement saw an increase in project work, resulting in 2% growth. The development of Mercer Marketplace, the private U.S. health insurance exchange launched in January, continues. In July, Mercer announced an initial group of 5 employers that will offer 2014 benefits through Mercer Marketplace. Since making this announcement 3 weeks ago, Mercer has added additional clients to the platform. Whether looking at revenue, margin or earnings, Mercer had an excellent quarter and first 6 months of the year.","So in summary, MMC's overall performance in the second quarter and first half of the year was exceptional. These results show that our companies' strong earnings growth continues.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to report another strong quarter.","Revenue in the quarter was $3.1 billion, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13% to $591 million and the consolidated margin increased 190 basis points to 19.2%. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.69, and adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.72. And this is on top of a strong second quarter last year, when adjusted EPS rose 22%.","For the first 6 months of this year, revenue was $6.2 billion, an increase of 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 14% to $1.2 billion, and the consolidated margin increased 200 basis points to 19.4%. GAAP EPS for the first half of the year rose 18% to $1.44, and adjusted EPS grew 17% to $1.45.","Investment income in the second quarter was $23 million compared with $4 million a year ago. As I discussed on last quarter's call, we retained carried interest in Trident III, a private equity fund MMC created in 2003. In 2006, we contributed our limited partner interest at $200 million to our U.K. pension plan but retained our share of the general partner interest. Recognition of carried interest is deferred until it is no longer subject to clawback. This quarter is the first time the carried interest from Trident III has been recognized, totaling $21 million, which added $0.02 to EPS. In the third quarter, we anticipate $5 million in investment income, primarily related to Trident III.","Interest expense in the quarter decreased from $45 million last year to $40 million in this quarter. Our next debt maturity of $320 million is in July of next year.","Both S&P and Moody's recently upgraded their outlook on MMC, reflecting our strengthening financial position.","Corporate expense declined to $46 million in the quarter from $45 million last year on an adjusted basis.","In May, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and increased the quarterly dividend by 9%, from $0.23 to $0.25 per share, effective in the third quarter. Our cash utilization in the second quarter included $150 million to repurchase 3.7 million shares of stock, $128 million for dividends and $100 million for acquisitions. In the first half of this year, we have bought back 6.4 million shares for $250 million. We remain committed to meaningful share repurchase.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Mike. And operator, we're ready to turn to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the U.S. growth, the organic there. What are the trends you're seeing in the U.S. risk business at this point in time, maybe from a units and pricing perspective? And how do you think that the organic there will look going forward from here?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. I mean, first, I would just say that, from an overall basis, if you look at how Marsh has performed over the last several quarters, they've generally been in an area of somewhere like 4%, 5% and 3% growth, so call it 3% to 5% growth organic. And Guy Carpenter has pretty much been a 5%, 6% and a 5%, so call it more around a 5% growth over the last several quarters. Why don't I turn to both Peter and Alex to give you some specific commentary as to how they see the P&C environment in both retail and reinsurance? So, Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Dan. Mentioning pricing, let me talk about overall margin, and specifically, I'll highlight the U.S. Overall, we saw a bit of slowdown when we compare the prior quarter in 2012, about 40 basis points. U.S. was the only major region that we saw increases in pricing, albeit modest. So when I compare year-over-year, the casualty lines, more of our clients saw rate increases than the prior year, but the average was a little bit less. And the one segment that did not see as much in terms of price increasing was the property. So I feel that it's a very stable environment. There's a couple of peaks that are being, as I said, mentioned in public D&O, workers' compensation, some excess umbrella, but generally speaking, it's modest increases for us in terms of pricing.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Peter. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Yes, so we were pleased with the growth in the U.S. Clearly, there's no tailwinds coming from rates, so it's really about just doing things better. It's about higher retentions. We've had good new -- solid new business. Our blend of broking, analytics and strategic advisory is working well. So, no help from the rates but just doing things better, concentrating on what we need to do to keep our clients. And essentially, that's it.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, so in summary, I would say you look at the U.S., and on the reinsurance side, there'd be more downward pressure on rates, so more softening activity on reinsurance. On the retail side, it's more flattish, but relative to the rest of the world, a bit better than the rest of the world in the U.S. We've been at this game a long time, and in years past, when you see softening in reinsurance, unless you have loss activity, it's pretty hard to prevent that from shifting into primary 6 months, 12 months, 18 months down the road.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. Very thorough. One other one is just on capital deployment. Good to see the buybacks and the higher dividend. If I was to step back, though, and go back to the 2010 Investor Day, when you sort of laid out the game plan for the corporation, you guys have actually beat your guidance and beat your numbers since then. The only component to that, that I think is behind this maybe I feel that, back then, you mentioned that capital deployment were contributing 300 basis points to the plan. I'm sort of wondering, has capital -- where do you think capital deployment will be from here? It seems like it's picking up. So can you sort of compare what you were thinking back in 2010 to where you're at today? There's a lot of optionality there.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Sure. I would say when you look at capital deployment, to begin with, our feeling is that we have rising free cash flow. So number one, that's a good-news story. And then when we look at how we would deploy that cash, we would probably look at dividends first. And we would look from here to keep our payout ratios in a similar area to where they are today. So you'd likely see us improving our dividend as we improve our earnings. Then we look at acquisitions, and we don't budget for acquisitions. We look at a lot of things and, ultimately, that's a variable. And share repurchase, we're committed to share repurchase. And if you look at the last 5 quarters, we've had 5 quarters in a row of share repurchase. So I think as you go forward, you'll see us both looking at a balanced basis in terms of deployment, dividend, acquisitions and share repurchase. But, Mike, do you want to add some color to that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, thank you, Dan. And Greg, you're absolutely spot on looking at us historically. Not only have we been reinvesting in our business, but we've really been paying down our debt and, essentially, deleveraging our balance sheet. In addition to that, we had pension obligations that we've put quite a bit of our cash flow into pension obligations. So that's historic. If you look going forward, we do not plan to delever our balance sheet actively. We think the natural earnings that you're seeing, not just this quarter but the past few years, will naturally deleverage our balance sheet. So we don't have to do any more debt pay-down, and we feel that the bulk of our contributions to our global pension plans are behind us. So, as Dan said, we look at the deployment of our capital on a balanced fashion going forward, and we feel very good about it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update us on your efforts in the health exchange. I know you had some announcements on that. And maybe talk a little bit more detail about what's going on there, and then also how we should think about maybe revenue and earnings impact as we head through the rest of the year.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, and your question, Dan, on revenue and earnings impact, is that specific to the health exchange or throughout the whole company?","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, how to think about how that will play through the rest of the year.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, terrific. So, Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thank you, Dan -- both Dans. I appreciate it. I want to put some light on what we consider to be a pretty good milestone for us in the quarter as it relates to Mercer Marketplace. You saw the press release came out announcing that we had 5 companies -- employers now already signed up to Mercer Marketplace. Since then, we've signed an additional 9 employers, and there are a significant amount of potential opportunities for both 2014 and 2015 still pending. Those 9 employers represent about 35,000 lives. And why we think it's such a milestone is because it really validates several key things about Mercer Marketplace. One is that it's very attractive to a lot of additional across-the-board industries and employers from as little as a couple of hundred employees to several thousand. And that's been something that we've seen as a distinction based on our offer, and it's beginning to hold true. While we've always been kind of cautious about what 2014 was going to give us, and we still are, we certainly are seeing a lot of activity. So it demonstrates that we have a very viable option for our clients. In addition to that, we continue to see activity, we continue to see more interest, and we'll see how that builds for '14 and '15. As far as revenue is concerned, as we have stated in the past, there'll be no material revenue recognized in 2013. This is for enrollment for those that are effective on January 1, 2014, and beyond. And then, of course, through '15, we'll see how that develops. And thus, the earnings will be the same, will be no significant impact on earnings in 2013. Now in the early years, as you can think about this, we, of course, will continue to invest. And I believe we'll see that, as this thing pans out, the earnings will be similar to the type of business that we have that's not in the Mercer Marketplace. So it'll be very consistent.","Daniel S. Glaser","So, Julio, just to confirm, you've got 9 companies signed up now?","Julio A. Portalatin","Nine companies signed up for about 35,000 lives.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Thank you.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up, there is some expense flowing through now that's already being absorbed within your margins, correct?","Julio A. Portalatin","That is correct. I mean, we are taking all expense right to the operating results for the Mercer Marketplace.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. One other quick question. The revenues had some modest FX headwind. Was there any meaningful or any FX impact to earnings in the quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So just one thing in terms of the expenses that we're rolling through on the health exchange, one of the ways you have to look at that is, with regard to health, there may be some downward margin pressure on -- specifically around the health exchange because of the investments. However, we're selling more product, and so there are -- typically, companies are now buying up additional product like voluntary products through Mercer Marketplace. And so it looks pretty much the same to us from a margin perspective. So, Mike, do you want to take the question on FX?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, Dan, you're absolutely right. Not only in this quarter but in almost every quarter over the last 6 quarters, foreign exchange has worked against us from the standpoint of profitability because of the strengthening of the dollar against most of our -- not all, but most of our major currencies, but it's been something that we've been able to absorb in every quarter, including this one.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I want to start with a question for Alex. As we start to see -- or not start to see -- as we see significant downward pressure on property cap reinsurance rates, does it move the needle at all in terms of clients no longer retaining more and maybe taking advantage of some of the reinsurance arbitrage opportunities?","Daniel S. Glaser","So, Alex, do you want to take that?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Yes, actually, we have seen the -- if your -- if the cost of your own capital is more expensive than the contingent capital out there, companies are buying more reinsurance. So it really depends on the company. There are companies, obviously, that have strong balance sheets, and their relative cost of capital for their different tranches makes it -- makes more sense to retain more. And there are others that are taking advantage of the cheap capacity that's available.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So in the aggregate, not a dramatic change?","Alexander S. Moczarski","We are -- to date, no. But we're obviously looking at it. And what's great for us is that we can provide advice to our clients because now there's so many alternatives that they face, and we look at their programs in a holistic manner. So actually, we're quite excited about what's going on.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fantastic. And for Mike, is there a good run rate for the number of shares that Marsh expects to issue this year, for computation and other purposes?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you. That's a very good question. And as you know, for a number of years, we've had essentially performance-based awards tied to the overall growth of the operating income. And so there we, every period, look and see whether there should be some additional accruals in that. So it's hard to basically give you a calibration of the run rate because it's tied to our performance. One of the things that I would say, though, is for our goal, over not just this year but many years, is to try to offset the potential dilution of any and all awards, including stock options, and that's one of the reasons why we've been doing meaningful share repurchase. In fact, over the last 5 quarters, I think we did about $480 million, so approaching almost $0.5 billion in share repurchase. But to your specific question, it's really hard to tell because it varies quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple questions here. First, I was hoping you could talk about what the pipeline looks like right now with Oliver Wyman, particularly with respect to continental Europe?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay.","John P. Drzik","Sure. All of one's business, as you know, is affected by macroeconomic conditions, and conditions are still relatively weak in our major markets, including Europe. Looking ahead, our recent sales and current pipeline have been strengthening to some extent. So, as Dan said, based on what we're seeing, we expect sequential improvement in revenue growth rate over the next couple of quarters, and that will come more from North America than Europe, but I think we're seeing improvement in both.","Daniel S. Glaser","And, Brian, just the way we look at it on an overall management team basis, Oliver Wyman, in many quarters and in many years actually, ends up outgrowing all the other OpCos. This year is obviously a tough year. And so from that standpoint, it's not going to be a big provider of revenue growth for us, so the direction of John and his team are to protect earnings. And they've been doing a really good job of making sure that the revenue shortfalls is not really an earnings event for us.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely. Great. And then next question, I guess, is for both Dan and Mike. When I look at your capital management and I look at your debt-to-capital ratios and I look at your debt-to-EBITDA, you're sitting here near historical lows. I guess my question is, is there a need to continue to let leverage decline? Why can't you take advantage of some of the low interest rates right now and actually lever up a little bit to buy back some stock at attractive levels?","Daniel S. Glaser","And so I'll take that and then hand over to the expert in Mike. But ultimately, the way I would first look at this is this is what we would call a high-class problem. And so from that standpoint, we're a conservative company, and we're looking to make sure -- I mean, when I look at things personally, it would be hard for me to think that we should lever up, specifically, to buy back stock. We could certainly lever up to make acquisitions if they became available to us or -- but I do think with enough of our increasing cash flow, we will have meaningful share repurchase in future quarters and in future years. And so the notion of levering up, even though it may have a slight appeal at this moment in time, just strikes us as not being in the philosophy of this conservative firm. But, Mike, do you want to add to that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, I think it's well said, Dan. Starting from this premise that you look at your entire capital structure and, Brian, you also look at your cash on hand, and you look at where it is and how you can deploy that. And so before we're thinking of going to the capital markets, we want to make sure that we're effectively using our capital. And I know you follow us closely so that you're aware that over the last year we were very effective in not only utilizing our international cash but bringing it back into the U.S. And so we could do, along the lines of what you're saying, repurchase our stock. We did 100 million in the first -- $100 million in the first quarter of this year, the first time in many, many years that we repurchased in the first quarter. So that was really utilizing our own cash on a global basis. The second thing then we look at, and as Dan and I have talked about on this call, is that we take a balanced approach. We want to put our capital deployment to dividends, acquisitions and share repurchase. So really, reinvesting back into the business, either direct capital investments or acquisitions, is a primary goal, but conversely, returning capital to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase is very important, so it's a blend. And then the last thing, as Dan said, we have a journey to elite. And when we've looked at companies around the world that are generally viewed as elite companies, their credit metrics typically have an A in it. So it's important to us. The last thing that would do is it gives us a cushion with regard to any future negative consequences that we may see in the macro environment or, as Dan said, opportunities that we may see going forward. So we think that the balanced approach is really a good guideline for analysts and investors.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you elaborate a bit on the reinsurance side in terms of capital markets activity that you're seeing participating in and whether or not that's been a contributor or you saw that in 2Q results and whether or not you expect that to be a bigger piece of the pie going forward?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, sure. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","So we reckon there's about $45 billion of convergent capital in the market. Not all of it is being deployed or can't find a place to be deployed. But clearly, there was an effect on the Florida renewals. It's essentially, as you know, focused on cat. Yes, I -- the question is -- some of it is pension money, some of it is private equity money. The pension money tends to stay for a long time, so we'll see what the effect will be on that. But we've had good activity on the cat bond side. I think there's been about $4.2 billion issued, more or less, and we've been involved in about $2.2 billion. So we're geared for that activity as well.","Daniel S. Glaser","And if you look at it, Mike, we're an intermediary, and so we can -- we're always looking at ways of creating value for clients. When we look for our clients having many sources of capital, both traditional and alternative, is a good thing. And our clients need advice. They would need somebody to evaluate the alternative forms and negotiate terms and conditions, et cetera. We've had some interesting work between Guy Carpenter and Marsh of late, which gives an example of the type of thing that could happen, where there may be some pressure in certain areas of Guy Carpenter on the cat side, but then there could be opportunities between Guy Carpenter and Marsh on the retail side. So, Peter, do you want to talk a little bit about the recent MTA transaction?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. Thanks, Dan. We're very excited. We did our first cat bond for one of our clients. As Dan mentioned the MTA, so it's a $200 million cat bond, and it's a real strong example of when we can bring the power of MMC together by using 2 operating companies to deliver a solution for our clients. We're actually starting to develop a pipeline. It tends to be very industry-specific. Don't think it'll replace any traditional capital that's being deployed for our clients, but it's very complementary and one that we expect to see more demand over time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick follow-up on free cash flow expectations and the earlier comment about the pension contribution falling. Could you put some figures around how much lower the pension contribution run rate could fall, especially given the interest rates and equity markets have been moving north?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, Mike. Mike, do you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, the one thing, Mike, that we've learned many, many years is because the remeasurement of our pension obligations occurs at the end of the year. And where interest rates are at the end of the year, even though things look favorable today, we have to wait till the end of the year. But that said, let me give you a little bit more color with regard to the pension obligations that we've been dealing with. Over the last 2 years, our committed funding levels in 2012 and 2013 were in the neighborhood of $320 million. In 2012, on top of that $320 million, we put $100 million of discretionary contribution into our U.K. plan. It was using our excess capital. We were able to do it on a tax-efficient basis. And obviously, it helped the funding ratios in the U.K. As we went into this year, on top of roughly the $320 million of obligations that we had, we thought that it was very prudent to basically do prefunding in the U.K. of about $250 million, once again, tax-efficient basis, utilizing our international cash, and about $70 million into our Canadian plans. As a result of that, we're anticipating that total funding for this year will be in the neighborhood of $650 million. So having said that the U.K. funding, that the $250 million included prefunding, it was prefunding of some of our obligations in the U.K. that would affect 2014, '15 and, perhaps, '16. And so we think that, based upon all of that, there will be a market decrease with regard to the levels or our pension obligations and the funding going forward in '14, '15 and, most likely, beyond.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. That's great color. The last question is in regards to the business climate in Europe. Some economists are cautiously optimistic, saying GDP has troughed. What is Marsh seeing on that front?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Why don't we do 2 things. Well, I'll address it overall, and then if we just kind of quickly go around the horn and have each of our operating companies give you a little bit of color of how they're viewing things in Europe these days. We've read some of the same material and, of course, oftentimes, the insurance, specifically, might be a lagging indicator and consulting may be a forward indicator in terms of activity. So we often look to OW as sort of our canary in the coal mine to try to get a view as to what's business sentiment like and whether discretionary spending is picking up. Bearing in mind, in terms of insurance, contracts tend to be annual, and Europe, at least in certain countries, is weighted toward January 1, so you don't see really any pickup until the following January 1 period. But why don't we go around the horn, starting with John Drzik of Oliver Wyman?","John P. Drzik","So as I said earlier, I think the conditions for us are showing a slight uptick, so we're seeing a little bit of improvement. So -- but I'd say, on the whole, conditions are still relatively weak. Our clients are still relatively cautious in terms of their discretionary spending, and so we're not seeing a major change. But I would say the directional indicators we see in our pipeline and from our business leadership that things are modestly improving in Europe.","Daniel S. Glaser","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Yes, so as Dan said, sometimes we're a trailing indicator. I wouldn't read into our quarter in terms of underlying growth in EMEA as one that would look similar in the future, meaning that we had really challenging comparables in the prior years. We had very strong growth in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. We have a really strong pipeline of new business. We had good new business growth in the quarter. There's some modest economic headwinds that are combined with pricing, so we see a little bit of headwind in the exposure in pricing but nothing that I would be concerned about trending forward. And there's always timing in the quarter. So overall, we're cautiously optimistic and expect to see continued organic growth.","Daniel S. Glaser","Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","So, reinsurance isn't -- whether reinsurance, is that correlated with economic conditions? If you've seen over the last 3 years, we've grown at a nice lick there, so it's more really about capacity and about losses. So we continue to look for growth.","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio, your view about Europe?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, I mean, our year-to-date growth in Europe continues to be positive. We certainly can't control the external environment, but we're trying hard to make sure that pipeline and opportunities that present themselves, we are very prepared and very well positioned to take advantage of it. So given some -- we've had some situations or some restructuring taking place there for some of our clients, and we certainly are well positioned for that. And our product side, services and some of our survey business continues to be in high demand in that part of the world. So we think that the top line, while a little bit softer than prior years, continues to be positive and is tracking pretty well.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, and just to add a little bit of overall flavor, Mike, in sort of tying together the comment that I had made earlier, I think in response to Brian's question about whether we should lever up and buy back shares, and my comment that we're a conservative company and that we would always look at making sure that we have enough powder dry for acquisitions if opportunities presented themselves. The way we look at the world is we're pretty much in an age of uncertainty. And I don't think anybody with their hand on heart can really give you a clear prognosis about macro conditions in Europe, what could conceivably happen in China, what could conceivably happen in the Middle East. I mean, there's a lot of flux. And being a conservative company and having the capability to be able to act quickly if certain opportunities presented themselves. So the way we look at it is if the world recovers, we're in great shape. If the world doesn't and actually turns downward, we're in good shape too. So that's our view on that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping to drill down a bit on Guy Carpenter. The 5% organic revenue growth despite the impact of downward pressure on reinsurance pricing. I was hoping you can deconstruct that a bit and, essentially, how much of that is driven outside of increased issuance in alternative facilities.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. So, Alex, how much is traditional growth and how much are you being supplemented by all this alternative capacity?","Alexander S. Moczarski","I think traditional growth would be about 98% of what we -- of the reason. The fact is that Carpenter has been investing well. We are -- I think we're the employer of choice. Good people have been joining us. Our accounts, our large accounts are pristine prestige accounts, and they've been growing too, and we've been growing with them. We have a good blend of broking and strategic advisory and analytics. And it's really about value. And it's also about making sure that you see a client on a regular basis, you do all the blocking and tackling and retention is high and new business is good.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. For Mike, on the Trident III that benefited from the additional investment income, is there any way to think about how much more could flow through in future quarters, so we can calibrate models?","Daniel S. Glaser","So, Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Jay, that's a very good question. And as you know, on investment income, we really try to help analysts look to what the next quarter may be. And that's why we gave you an indication of about $5 million, including Trident III, because we know it's very difficult, certainly, when Trident II was liquidating over a 3- or 4-year period. So the question that you have specifically gets to Trident III, and as we said, this is the first quarter that we've actually booked carried interest because it's really the first time period that Trident III has started to liquidate its position. But I think its portfolio, which I have not tracked as closely as Trident II, but I think the portfolio is well over $1 billion. And so as Trident III gets liquidated, which could occur over 3 or 4 years, we do not control it, we do not manage it, and so we'll just have to see how it comes through. Now there's an additional hurdle with regard to the carried interest because the way that we book it for accounting, it has to be to a point where there is no clawback capability, which means that if the rest of the portfolio went to 0, we would still be entitled to what we booked through our income. So sorry I can't give you more specifics other than it could go a number of years as we work our way through it. But it's a nice story, and it will be additional cash to us and additional earnings. But obviously, it's investment income, it's not operating, and that's why we try to isolate it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And then finally for Dan, can you tell us a bit more about your appetite for bolt-on acquisitions, both in RIS and Consulting, since there seems to be a continued interest level in that area?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, and I would say very strong. I mean, we've done a series of acquisitions. I mean, if you look in total over the last 5.5 or 6 years, we've done about 60 acquisitions. Most of them have been in RIS, and clearly, MMA has been a core strategy to that. When we look at acquisitions, we look at a lot of factors. The first factor is, generally, does it make us better? Does it give us something that we don't have? Does it expand a capability, a segment, a geography? And then what's the management team like, and are they committed to working not only over the long term, but also working at a bigger organization like us? And we feel that there's an awful lot of companies out there that, when they look at the world today and the macro uncertainty and the higher degrees of regulation and risk in compliance activities and just the sheer level of items that management teams have to deal with, many of these smaller companies come to the realization that they're spending too much time on running this business and not enough time on chasing new accounts and servicing existing accounts. And so we become a very good alternative. Now I can tell you around the world, we don't jump opportunistically at every thing that presents itself because our own feeling is this is more like a courtship that generally takes several years to develop to make sure that there's an affinity between the acquirer and the company being acquired. And so we have a pretty rich pipeline, but no schedule in order to execute that pipeline. There are certain acquisitions that we have done that, literally, we have cultivated for years. Okay?","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, we understand there's a big pipeline there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I'm sure that you've done a very good job on handling expenses overall in the -- on the Consulting side. I'm just wondering, in a sense, in terms of year-over-year comparisons, can we continue to expect to see expenses decline while revenues are up a little bit going forward?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, no, Tom, it's a great question. So let me just take it first by saying our goal is to achieve double-digit earnings growth in most years over the long term. And we fully understand in order to achieve a goal like that, we need to continuously improve performance and continuously invest in our business, our technologies, our -- and our colleagues. And so I want to assure you that even though you're seeing flat expenses now, we are spending money. We're spending money on colleagues, we're spending money on investing for future growth, and we are harvesting operational improvements that we have developed over the last several years and that we are continuing to develop. So I would say that a lot's going on under the hood, and that the fact is we're benefiting on some roll-forward of prior actions and efficiency gains, but we don't -- the cupboard's not bare. We're still achieving additional efficiency gains, so we definitely feel that we'll be able to manage expenses. Whether we manage them at a flat or we manage them at low single digits, we'll still be containing our expenses for the foreseeable future.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","That's a good answer. And on a more very mundane basis, the accounting item -- adjustments to acquisition-related accounts, contingent consideration related to acquisitions, just reading that, it sounds to me like if you made a good acquisition, that's a number that would grow in the future. Do I have that right or wrong?","Daniel S. Glaser","No, basically, this is related to the earnouts on acquisitions. Many of the acquisitions that we do have an earnout component. When a firm that we acquire underperforms our expectations of what we have within the earnout, then you would see a negative on that line. And when a -- one of our acquired companies actually outperforms the earnout calculation, then we'll put additional money against the contingent consideration. Mike, do you have anything?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, Tom, I would just say it's also a mechanism that we use to bridge the future -- perhaps, the differences between the future outlooks of the sellers and ourselves, and whereas sellers may be absolutely more optimistic and rosy about the outlook, and we're more conservative. And so instead of giving the consideration upfront, we basically have an agreement to say that if the optimism manifests itself, we'll all be happy. So essentially, the way we would view it, we paid a little bit more for an acquisition, but the results were much better than we thought. Conversely, it's a protection for our shareholders if the results, as Dan said, don't perform based upon the expectations of the seller. The nice thing is, I think, over the last 5 years, where we've done about, what, $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion of acquisitions value in total, the actual contingent consideration has been very modest.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And so going forward, though, I'm just assuming that if you continue to make acquisitions every year then -- and you're conservative in your assumptions, you will, in fact, have an item like this, more or less, continuously?","J. Michael Bischoff","Tom, you're absolutely right. I mean, that account changes every quarter. We have additions, we have payments made out, we have revaluation impact. At the end of the quarter, it was in the neighborhood of $80 million. But it will be continuous with regard to how we do the structure of the deal. As a result of that, we view it just as purchase or acquisition accounting, which is why we do not include it in our adjusted earnings and why we exclude it.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to go ahead and turn the call back to you, Mr. Glaser, for any additional or closing remarks.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay, perfect. Thank you, Jamie. I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. I mean, this call is naturally oriented toward shareholders, but I also want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our 54,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results and to our tens of thousands of clients for their belief in Marsh & McLennan Companies.

Glaser","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results as reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC.","Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. Following my comments, Mike will discuss our financial results in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","We had an excellent first quarter, which represents another step forward in our journey to be among the elite companies of the world. We are successfully executing the 4 pillar strategy that has served us well. It calls for us to produce long-term growth in revenue and earnings, maintain low capital requirements, generate high levels of cash and manage the risk profile of the company. We remain committed to building on this foundation as we pursue new ways to grow, invest and realize the full potential of our businesses.","Marsh & McLennan's strong first quarter results demonstrate that we are performing well. In the first quarter, growth in underlying revenue exceeded growth in underlying operating expenses, as it has for 19 of the past 20 quarters. In the quarter, this operating leverage produced 16% growth in adjusted operating income and our consolidated margin increased 230 basis points to 19.7%. Importantly, both operating segments delivered mid-teens growth in adjusted operating income, as well as substantial margin improvement. Adjusted underlying expense growth was flat in the first quarter. However, as we progress through the year, we expect to see modest expense growth, thus tempering margin expansion for the remainder of the year.","Risk and Insurance Services produced another outstanding quarter. Underlying revenue growth at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter was 4%. Adjusted operating income for this segment rose 14%, with margins expanding to 26.6%, an increase of 210 basis points. This is the segment's highest quarterly margin since 2004, an impressive performance when you consider the headwinds we are facing, such as lower fiduciary income, higher pension expense and a challenging economic environment in most developed countries.","At Marsh, revenue was $1.4 billion, with all major geographies contributing to Marsh's 4% underlying revenue growth. We are pleased with this performance since it comes on the heels of a very strong growth in last year's first quarter. The International division grew 5%, with Latin America up 13%, Asia-Pacific increasing 6%, and EMEA growing 3%. The U.S.\/Canada division increased 2%, a solid performance, given the strong growth of 6% last year.","Marsh continued to generate high levels of new business, with $256 million this quarter. Guy Carpenter continued to produce impressive results, with revenue of $375 million in the first quarter or growth of 4% on an underlying basis. We are especially pleased with this performance considering the 7% growth in last year's first quarter, higher risk retentions by clients and softening pricing conditions.","Guy Carpenter's revenue growth reflects both higher revenue retention, as well as strong new business development. Consistent with Carpenter's goal of broadening its geographic footprint, double-digit revenue growth was achieved in Continental Europe and Latin America, with solid gains in Global Specialties. This excellent performance now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter's quarterly underlying revenue growth into the fifth consecutive year.","In our Consulting segment, we continue to focus on higher levels of profitability. In the first quarter, revenue was $1.4 billion, flat on an underlying basis, as growth at Mercer was offset by revenue declines at Oliver Wyman. Importantly, the Consulting segment produced significant earnings growth of 15% to $189 million, as adjusted underlying expenses decreased 2%. As a result, the segment's margin expanded 190 basis points to 13.9%, driven primarily by Mercer.","At Oliver Wyman, underlying revenue in the first quarter decreased 9%, as declines in North America and Europe more than offset expansion in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In this difficult macroeconomic environment, John and his management team have taken steps to protect Oliver Wyman's profitability.","Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis. On a geographic basis, Mercer grew revenue across each of its major regions. Among its lines of business, strong revenue growth was achieved by Health and Investments. These excellent results in the first quarter reflect the series of actions taken by Mercer's management to reposition the business to grow earnings.","In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 2% on both the reported and underlying basis.  Adjusted operating income rose 16% to $615 million, our highest level of quarterly profitability in almost a decade. And the consolidated margin increased 230 basis points to 19.7%, again, our highest level since 2004.","GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.74, and adjusted EPS grew 16% to $0.73.","As we discussed last quarter, to assist in building broader client relationships, Mercer has aligned its Benefit Administration services, formerly described as Outsourcing, within its principle business lines, thus positioning Mercer's capabilities around Health, Retirement, Talent and Investments.","Also in the first quarter, a significant portion of Marsh's U.S. Consumer business was transferred to Mercer. Last year, this business had $231 million of revenue, operating income of $40 million and close to 1,000 colleagues. Realigning these 2 businesses within Mercer enables us to concentrate our efforts and expertise in a rapidly shifting landscape, including the convergence between traditional benefits and voluntary benefits. Mercer also used the consumer call center operation to support Mercer Marketplace, its healthcare exchange. The supplemental schedules in our press release provide quarterly revenue, operating income and margins for the past 3 years, reflecting the Consumer and Outsourcing reclassifications.","MMC is delivering excellent operating and financial results while continuing to invest for the future. As an indication of this, our capital expenditures have grown substantially in recent years, from approximately $270 million in 2010 to $320 million last year. And CapEx is expected to be approximately $350 million this year, including over $120 million in the first quarter.","We're constantly investing in each of our businesses. Throughout the company, we have been creating new products and tools to enhance client service, replacing legacy systems with next-generation technology, improving efficiencies and developing new operating platforms that increase our global capabilities.","Investment also includes recruiting and retaining the best talent in our industries. We believe the investments we are making will continue to create significant shareholder value.","Investment income in the first quarter was $21 million due to the winding up of Trident II, which accounted for the vast majority of our investments in private equity. We expect only minimal income from our Investment portfolio over the remainder of this year. However, while we no longer have an investment in Trident III, we have retained performance fees related to the creation of this fund in 2003. Recognition of these deferred fees will only occur as investments are harvested and the performance fees are no longer subject to callback. Timing of this is unknown and is not controlled by MMC.","Interest expense decreased to $44 million in the first quarter due to a reduction in debt. And our next debt maturity of $320 million is in July of next year. Corporate expense declined to $45 million in the first quarter on an adjusted basis. Although there is variability quarter-to-quarter, we believe this is a reasonable quarterly run rate.","Cash utilization. As you know, our cash utilization is typically greatest in the first quarter, primarily due to the payment of incentive compensation awards. Additional uses of cash in the quarter included: $320 million for discretionary pension contributions; $250 million for maturing debt; $125 million for dividends; and $100 million to repurchase 2.7 million shares of our common stock. In fact, this represents the first time since 2004 that we've repurchased stock in the first quarter. And since instituting the current share repurchase program in late 2010, we have repurchased 25 million shares.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Mike. And operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just ask about the operating margins, which were excellent in the quarter, relative to what we were thinking. And I think in your commentary, you mentioned that we won't see the same level of increase for the rest of the year. So can you first maybe just talk a bit about how you did so well? And then number two, can you maybe clarify a bit on how we should think about that for the rest of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Well as we've shown over the past 5 years, we've pretty much aligned expenses and revenues. So when we saw and spoke with you in sort of the back half of last year or going into the back half of last year, we began to anticipate some revenue deceleration, which we saw not only in RIS but more particularly in the discretionary spending areas of our Consulting businesses. And so we started -- we always actively manage expense, but we were -- we definitely keep a very watchful eye on expenses, particularly in this kind of macro environment. And so we started decelerating our expenses as well. And if you look even back to last year, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're decelerating, and obviously, in this quarter, where we're overall flat on the expense side. We're feeling a little bit better looking at the future, little bit more optimistic on revenue. But we just wanted to temper the big margin expansion, so there's not an expectation. Because, obviously, we don't know what the top line is. We're out there building our top line. I won't say emphatically that we won't deliver that kind of margin expansion because I don't know what the top line is going to be. But I can say that if we operate the top line like we do right now in that sort of 3% or 4% range, then we would not sustain the 230 basis points quarter-after-quarter.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great. So you're really flexing the expenses to the revenue outlook and you're feeling a bit better there from this point forward. Obviously outside of Oliver Wyman, I would imagine.","Daniel S. Glaser","No, even within Oliver Wyman as well. I'd be happy to hand it over to John to give you a little bit more color about Oliver Wyman and what they feel their prospects are. John?","John P. Drzik","Sure. So if we look at Q1, before talking about the outlook, I mean, our weak performance in Q1 had stemmed from the challenging business conditions we faced in Q4 and in early Q1 this year, where in Europe we had a recessionary economic climate persisting. And in the U.S., business confidence was weak largely due to political uncertainties around the fiscal cliff, the sequestration and sort of stopped awards from discretionary spending, reducing demand for Consulting. So these weak -- it was a weak sales environment for us in Q4 last year and early part of this year and that translated into weak revenues, particularly in the early part of Q1 this year. Now we've seen our sales pick up during Q1 and our business performance has improved each month of the quarter. March was our best month. So looking ahead, we expect Q2 to be better than Q1 based on our current sales and pipeline activity and expect to return to growth in the second half of the year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great color. And then last is just on the buybacks. It was nice to see the buybacks in the first quarter. As you said, you hadn't done that for almost 10 years. Can you talk about a bit about your appetite for buybacks at the current levels and what we should be expecting?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Well, I mean, we have increasing free cash flow over the last couple of years. And as we grow earnings, we expect that to continue. And so when we look at uses of cash, we fund some internal investments. But that's fairly rare to get those lumps, because frankly, we run most of our investments through our P&Ls anyway so they don't appear in extra uses of cash. Our dividend is really sacrosanct and we maintain a strong dividend. And then we've got an active pipeline. So we look at acquisitions, really, all over the world. We don't do that many deals, but we certainly look at a lot of them. And we can't really time that out for you. But share repurchase, to us, we believe in the company. So when we have available cash, we will buy back our own shares. Next question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit of what you're seeing on the reinsurance side. You, Dan, you referenced softening prices a little bit. And then, vis-\u00e0-vis capital market solutions, how you're positioning Carpenter to be a player in that.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So Alex, over to you.","Alexander S. Moczarski","Okay. In the first quarter, I wouldn't say that there was much effect from rates. Obviously, accounts that we have were affected by Sandy. We saw some stiffening of rates. And in general, rates had a benign effect on the quarter. But certainly, this downward pressure is, one, more capital; two, less cap losses; and three, stronger balance sheets. And so we're expecting to see some downward pressure. But interestingly enough, if there's cheap alternative capital, you look at your capital. We have a trenching tool, and look at the cost of capital. Actually, we may be buying -- some of our clients are actually buying more reinsurance than they bought before. As regards -- how do we deal with this new alternative capital coming in? Well, we've been sort of fairly good at that in the past. We've had a lot of success with our product -- our quill product. And two, we understand that we need to continue to expand our capabilities there. We have a pipeline of hires who understand that business better, understand the appetites of the capital that's coming in. And so we certainly are focused on it, we want to embrace it. And we think that our value to our clients is the advice we give and we'll continue to be valuable.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Great. And then just quickly, Dan, you just talked about buyback. But I'm just curious, what drove the decision to repurchase shares in the first quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike, you wanted to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, thank you, Dan. Larry, as you know, we ended last year with $2.3 billion on our balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents. And so not only was it robust overall, but we were very effective over the course of the third, fourth quarter and early part of the first quarter, of bringing back a lot of that cash into the U.S. on a very tax-efficient basis. So as an outcome of those activities, we had more flexibility in the first quarter. And even though we had a lot of uses for the cash, we felt very comfortable in repurchasing 100 million shares in the quarter.","Daniel S. Glaser","Next question?","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could give little bit more color on what's going on with Mercer, particularly in the Retirement area and the Talent area?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Sure. Thanks for the question, Brian. As you saw, and we talked about in the past, in the Talent area, we have there the highest mix of project work consultancy in the globe, which is, of course, more sensitive to economic cycles and discretionary spending decisions of our clients. And there's no question that you can see that those types of decisions by our clients are being very defensive in the days that -- of the quarter and probably for us, in days ahead as well. But look, the strength of Mercer, though, is its diversification. We have significant other businesses that, of course, have ancillary and absolutely repeatable revenue streams. And those that performed very well, as we mentioned already, in the Health area and the Investment area, we saw some really good growth there. And now it's even, off of some very powerful growth that we had in the first quarter 2012 in those areas. So we're feeling pretty comfortable about our prospects to be able to maximize our diversification of our portfolio, so we can continue to grow and also improve profitability.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And can you give an update on how the healthcare exchange has gone?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, sure, absolutely. Lots of activity to report there. We recently announced a pretty impressive lineup of participating carriers for Health, sponsored, ancillary and voluntary product choices and are in active with numerous firms who are considering Mercer Marketplace for their employees in 2014 and some in 2015. So firms like Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare, Humana and Anthem [ph] have decided to participate in our core medical offering, while organizations like Allstate and Met and many others who offer voluntary benefits such as P&C products, ID, theft protection, legal coverage and, of course, the always offered dental and vision and much more. So our goal was to have the most flexible and complete solution in the market for companies of virtually all sizes. And Mercer Marketplace has proven to be just that. We can offer companies a wide range of benefits and carrier choices to offer to their employees. Now we offer employees an excellent buying experience. We're pretty excited about the prospects.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Are you generating revenues out of it yet? And when do you expect to start seeing revenues?","Julio A. Portalatin","No, this is -- the enrollment period for 2014 will start in the fall. So any revenue will fall into '14, not '13.","Daniel S. Glaser","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just want to -- I wonder if you could talk a bit more about the margin improvement efforts within the Consulting business. You've had some very nice success there over the past year, and I've been particularly impressed with this quarter, given the weaker organic growth. But I'm wondering, is this -- how far along are you in all the stuff that you've wanted to do there? How much more stuff do you have to do that's in your control? So maybe just give us an overall update on that.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Well, I'll start with that and ultimately hand over to Julio to give you a little bit more color. But we started, really, maybe 18 months ago, talking about how we thought that the Consulting business could be improved on a profitability basis. And that we could take some of the disciplines and approaches that we were using in the RIS side of the business and apply them within Consulting. And we actually moved some people and we used some technology, changed the structure to where it was more aligned with both a geographic and a line of business matrix within Mercer. Oliver Wyman stayed on a line of business basis because it's a different kind of structure and market, and we started the march. And we talked about that, really, from a couple of years ago, and our belief is that we can, similar to the RIS side, manage expenses aligned with what kind of revenue we're seeing and achieve some significant gains in margin over a long period of time. Now, consulting is a little lumpier than RIS. It's got less recurring revenues than RIS, so it might not be quarter by quarter, every single quarter. But over a long period of time, we expect those margins to continue to improve. Now, I'll hand it over to Julio to give you a little bit more color.","Julio A. Portalatin","Thank you, Dan. We're pretty pleased with the continued margin expansion that we're seeing at Mercer. Our top line growth combined with our focus on cost discipline is really what's driving the results. We're going to state this, it's within -- a bit defensive in some places and also continue to  invest in others. We have a significant amount of expansion that we expect in the years to come that will hopefully allow us to continue to calibrate our expenses to our growth on revenue. And some of those, you've heard me talk about before, whether it's expansion in the growth market, whether it's expansion in our breadth of products that we have to offer, in our distribution points like Mercer Marketplace and other investments we're making in technology, client-facing technology, especially, I think will pay dividends for us in the future and allow us to continue to calibrate appropriately with our expenses. So we will continue to be disciplined and defensive in some areas, invest in others. And of course, we don't anticipate any additional restructuring. As you know, we announced some in the fourth quarter of last year, but we do expect that as our year goes on, that we'll continue to invest in those things that will give us the top line and expense efficiency that we need.","Daniel S. Glaser","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Dan, maybe just touching on your comment about Oliver Wyman making some moves to protect profitability, just curious if you can give me a little bit more color on those actions.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. I'll address it a little bit, but I think it would be better for me to hand it off to John, who could give you more details. We run our businesses differently. We have 2 segments. And we look at Consulting in a different way than we look at RIS. And so, the models are a bit different. And as we talked about, about a year ago when Oliver Wyman's growth started to come off, we were saying that, that was going to be more of a revenue event than an earnings event. And then Oliver Wyman had a more fungible business model, which is sort of best-in-front in that they could fairly easily move people from one part of the world to another part of the world, so it's not that they carry a lot of stranded cost on expense. And so, let me just hand it over to John to give you some more flavor.","John P. Drzik","Yes, I think there are few other factors behind us protecting our margin in the first quarter. I think, first, given the weak conditions we saw in Q4 2012, we expected Q1 would be challenging from a revenue standpoint. So we took that actions to constrain our operating expenses in that environment. The second point is that our compensation model is very performance sensitive and since it's a major part of our expense base, that part of the expense basis flexes naturally down with our weaker performance. And then finally, I think coming into 2013, we expected our operating profitability of our business portfolio to be stronger. So there were a number of expense investments, for example, that matured through the course of time. And so, the combination of those factors enabled us to protect our margin despite the revenue decline.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, I don't know, if Peter or Dan, do you want to address this, but the new business in Marsh, is that -- I mean, how much of that is being generated out of the U.S. versus internationally? Is there any sort of flavor you could give in terms of that number?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, thanks. Let me hand it over to Peter.","Peter Zaffino","Sure, Ray. It's actually quite balanced, the new business, it has been for the last year. The 2 regions where we had the strongest new business in the first quarter were actually the U.S. and Latin America. So while we're seeing from strategic investments, very strong growth in the emerging part of the world, we're also seeing very strong new business for the U.S. And when you look at last year, as Dan opened up with, we're the top comparable. So to get stronger new business year-over-year, really is a tribute to the pipeline and how we're executing.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. And last one, a numbers one, if I can squeeze it in, for Mike. The CapEx you talked about for 2013, that was $350 million. Is that correct?","J. Michael Bischoff","That's absolutely correct, even including, I think, the $126 million in the first quarter. We typically track around $75 million to $80 million a quarter CapEx rate. You can see in the first quarter of last year, it was about $25 million below it. And in the first quarter, it's above that. But we think then, over the course of the next 3 quarters, it will track more like we normally would see in the neighborhood of $75 million to $80 million, realizing it could be variable quarter-to-quarter.","Daniel S. Glaser","Next question, operator?","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess one question. Can you talk a bit on the U.S. organic and just kind of the renewal book there and kind of what sort of trends you're seeing? Just get some color and just one quick follow-up.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, Mike. I'll hand it over to Peter.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And that's on the risk side, I should say.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure.","Peter Zaffino","Sure. For the U.S. core business, as I said, the new business has been strong, but the biggest contributor is really the renewal retention, revenue retention. And so a strong rollover from last year of new business, very strong client retention. I would say the third factor is modest pricing improvement. So when we look across the different segments within the U.S. business, more of our clients are receiving rate increases than are receiving rate decreases. The lines of business that probably are seeing the biggest increases are D&O more on the financial lines, access and umbrella, workers' compensation. So we have seen some benefit, not much, but some benefit, in the U.S. but it's been offset by the International where there's more headwinds.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So in that environment, I mean, does the size or scale or, how do you view the reasons behind the renewal book sort of improving in quality?","Peter Zaffino","I think the biggest component or lift is really the strong retention that we have for client and the strong rollover we have from the production pipeline. So again, strong new business last year, rollover, more clients, strong retention is really what the biggest contributor is.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, I just -- one question, maybe, Dan. Obviously, Berkshire has made a couple big announcements recently. Can you just talk about how either of those either impact your business or how you perceive their impact on the market overall?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. I'm not going to get into the weeds of what other companies are doing in the market. I think it's fair to say that there is plenty of capital in the insurance industry, and that our clients are well-served, and we are good intermediaries to find that capital for them when they need it. And so at the end, the insurance business is pretty healthy. Insurance companies have done pretty well, notwithstanding the big cats of 2011. And as you look at shareholder surplus and that sort of thing, it's an appealing business for many. And so capital is continuing to rise. And on that basis, we'll continue to work with our clients to access whatever capital they need.","Operator","And we'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Within the Risk P&C business, to supplemental payments, commissions, do they come in more in one quarter than another, or are they pretty evenly spread?","Daniel S. Glaser","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","They're pretty evenly spread. There's no one quarter where we would benefit more than another for any fee or commissions from insurance carriers.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, okay. As far as Europe and the RIS services, do you expect that business to flatten? Or as the environment isn't getting better, the potential of that just continues to drift off?","Daniel S. Glaser","So you're talking about our EMEA segment?","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Peter?","Peter Zaffino","That's held up very well. I mean, certainly, we're very cautious, as Dan said, from last year looking into the economic conditions within Europe and other parts of the world. But for us, most of our European countries within EMEA grew, albeit modest. And it's been a real steady performer. And so, there's no signs to suggest that it's going to fall off from its track over the last -- for 6 quarters.","Daniel S. Glaser","One thing to bear in mind, some countries in Continental Europe are sort of weighted toward renewals in the first quarter. So a good start to the year usually signals a decent year for them.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right, right, okay. And one final question on the health exchanges. I know it's early, but how's your pipeline looking for the 2014 enrollment?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","The pipeline is very strong. As you can imagine, we have client and prospects who are very interested in having deep discussions about the Mercer Marketplace alternatives. Many of these conversations are leading to work that may not be directly related to Mercer Marketplace, but thus, we help our consultancy with these prospects and clients as well. So the pipeline is strong. Many are making decisions and we're consulting them on whether or not 2014 is the right timing or 2015 is the right timing for them. So we'll see over the coming months as to who comes on in 2014 and who comes on in 2015.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Operator, I think it's time for 2 or 3 more questions. So are there any other questions?","Operator","Yes, sir. We'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But just in terms of more getting a flavor for the organic growth. I know within Oliver Wyman, you had mentioned seeing trends pick up as we move throughout the quarter. And would you say maybe the same if you're looking in terms of RIS? And also within Mercer, did you see trends kind of improve as we got later on in the quarter? Was it more consistent throughout the 3 months?","Daniel S. Glaser","I think one thing, when you think about RIS and about 70% of Mercer tends to be recurring revenue. So the trends are rarely, do you see acceleration. You basically look at year-over-year in terms of what the renewal date was in the previous year. So I think that Oliver Wyman has often been a good canary for us in terms of determining where the macro environment is going. And Oliver Wyman is anticipating some better trends, particularly towards the back half of the year.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then also in terms of the Healthcare investment, from one of the questions earlier, you had said we would more see some of the revenue from those exchanges come up in 2014. Do you anticipate, when we gear up towards 2014 enrollment period later this year, seeing a little bit of a pickup in expenses there that might hit later in the year and then see the revenue early next year? Should we see that maybe impacting margins a little bit later on this year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So let me answer that a little bit, and then I'll hand it over to Julio. I think one thing you have to bear in mind when there's such a change like we're seeing in healthcare reform is that the initial waves are largely around existing clients making decisions. And certainly, we're talking to a number of prospects. But most of our time is serving customers, serving existing clients. And so when you think about, okay, if a client may elect to go onto the exchange or they may elect to stay out of an exchange and buy their insurance in a traditional way. So I think at least in the early waves, you have to consider that these are different choices that a client would have. And over a long period of time, what you'll see on successful exchanges will be that they'll be able to build some share because of the quality or breadth of their exchange. Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","In the first couple of years, we don't expect a significant impact on margins or expenses, quite frankly, as it relates to the exchange in Mercer Marketplace, in particular. I would expect to, obviously, have margins that are more in line with what we're seeing today in the business as years out develop. So I wouldn't expect a little lumpiness in this period of time.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Operator, I think we can take 1 more question.","Operator","And the final question will come from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Had a question about Guy Carpenter and some of the organic growth. I was wondering if -- how much of the growth in the quarter came from one-time transactions, capital markets alternative as opposed to sort of the traditional renewal book?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Let me address this slightly and then I'll hand over to Alex. I just want to make the point that Guy Carpenter grew 7% organically in last year's first quarter. So they're comparable, with a pretty high comparable, and they've done pretty well against that comparable. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Clearly, at the beginning of the year on the cap side, we'll be oftentimes selling products which won't necessarily be renewed. But we've been able to do that well. And the bulk of our business continues to be renewable business. And what we've done is we've increased discipline around client service, improved advice, as well as a very focused new business approach. I think we've been able to keep the momentum.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I was just wondering if there was any like large one-time capital market events that happened?","Alexander S. Moczarski","No. No.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No? Okay. And just one follow-up. I was wondering if there was any additional color on the MMA front on the agency business and how that's looking.","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, absolutely. Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. The MMA platform is very exciting. We're now approaching almost $500 million in annualized revenues. The acquisition pipeline is quite strong. And again, we don't report in the segments, but they had a very good quarter in terms of growth and profitability in margin expansion. So we're excited. They're actually very focused on how we invest in driving organic growth so it's not just the acquisitions that are going to drive value for MMA. We tend to do less acquisitions for a variety of reasons in the first half of the year. But again, excited about the pipeline and the prospects for future growth.","Daniel S. Glaser","I would just like to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. I'd also like to thank our clients for their support of Marsh & McLennan Companies and certainly, our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in delivering such fine results. Have a good day.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation."],"14264":["Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.

Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Dan Farrell of Investor Relations.","We balance investing for the long-term with delivering strong performance in the short-term. Doing this requires ongoing investment, disciplined execution and thoughtful capital allocation. Our performance will continue to reflect the compounding benefits of numerous strategic actions bearing fruit over time. Each of our businesses has a strong foundation for growth as the world continues to see accelerating change and complexity.","From a macro perspective, there continues to be significant under-penetration of insurance globally, including sizable protection gaps in areas such as natural catastrophe and cyber risk. The world needs solutions in areas such as digital transformation, complexity of the health sector, retirement needs of an aging population, and the workforce of the future. We are uniquely positioned to serve clients with global capabilities around risk, strategy and people.","Before discussing our results, I would like to update you on several moves we've made since last quarter, which highlight how we continue to invest for long-term revenue and earnings growth. I will also provide a brief update on the Competition and Markets Authority review of the UK investment consulting industry.","In the second quarter, Mercer announced the expansion of their investment capability by acquiring a license in India. India is a market that is seeing ongoing pension reform, which we believe will drive increased third-party investment advisory services. Mercer also continues to add to its geographic region capabilities through strategic M&A. In the quarter, we completed two acquisitions in the career line of business, which adds roughly $16 million of annualized revenue.","In late June, Marsh announced an agreement to acquire Houston-based Wortham Insurance, the 33rd largest agency in the U.S. with more than $130 million of revenue and 530 colleagues. This business offers a wide range of property, casualty and employee benefits products and services. Wortham, founded in 1915, is a premier broker with a culture and business mix that fits nicely with Marsh's existing retail business in Texas. The combined business will operate as Marsh Wortham and will be led by Richard Blades, the Chairman of Wortham.","During the quarter, we also completed three acquisitions in Marsh & McLennan Agency adding $15 million of annual revenue. Marsh & McLennan Agency has annualized revenue of approximately $1.3 billion. As we have said previously, this is a faster underlying growth business within Marsh. With the success of building out our national presence over the last decade, we continue to see opportunity for smaller fold-in transactions in addition to the other mid-sized M&A we have executed in the past.","Also in the second quarter, our UK commercial and consumer business completed an acquisition in Scotland adding approximately $15 million of revenue. We continue to see strong growth runway in the middle and small commercial areas. Further aligning with this market opportunity, in the second quarter, we announced the rebranding of our MGA business, the Schinnerer Group, to Victor. The rebranding includes Victor O. Schinnerer in the U.S. as well as our brands in Canada, the UK, Europe and Bermuda.","The ICAT and Dovetail insurance platforms will be part of the Victor global business but will retain their current names. Combining our extensive underwriting, analytical, capital and tech capabilities across geographies will allow for greater innovation and client service. These changes further support our strategic efforts at the consumer and smaller end of the commercial marketplace where digital capabilities will have an increasingly important role in the business.","The middle and small commercial marketplace is vast and highly fragmented, and we view this area as an opportunity to leverage Marsh's scale, expertise and capabilities. Last quarter, we discussed how Marsh was implementing changes with the goal of simplifying the organization through reduced management layers and more common structures across regions and businesses. These changes align with Marsh's segmentation strategy allowing a more targeted value proposition in large-risk management, middle-market corporate, and small commercial and consumer segments.","The actions being taken will likely result in total restructuring charges of $80 million to $100 million with $55 million taken this quarter. These charges are classified as noteworthy, and therefore excluded from our adjusted results. This simplification initiative will result in increased efficiencies and additional capacity for reinvestment in people and technology to drive future growth and innovation.","Now, let me update you on the review conducted by the UK Competition and Markets Authority of the investment consulting marketplace. In a provisional report issued last week, the CMA did not recommend any structural changes. The CMA did recommend certain industry-wide remedies involving mandatory tendering, enhanced fee disclosure, and common standards for reporting performance.","The report describes the marketplace that is not highly concentrated and states there is no evidence of conflicts of interests that give rise to a competition problem. We welcome the clarity that last week's provisional decision brings, and we look forward to continuing to work with the CMA, which plans to issue its final report in March 2019.","Now, let me discuss our results for the second quarter and first half of 2018. Results were mixed in the quarter with strength in RIS offset by weaker-than-expected result in Consulting, specifically in Mercer's Defined Benefit Consulting business and Oliver Wyman's financial services practice. For the quarter, consolidated revenue was $3.7 billion, up 7%, or 6% excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard.","Underlying revenue growth in the quarter was 3%. Adjusted operating income grew 4% to $754 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 2%, and the adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share grew 10%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted earnings per share increased 8%. For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 11% or 8% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, and adjusted EPS increased 11% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard.","In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 9%, or 8% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was a strong 5% in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter in the quarter. Marsh U.S.\/Canada underlying growth of 8% was the highest quarter of growth since we began reporting the U.S.\/Canada division in 2008.","International underlying growth was 2% in the quarter with Asia-Pacific up 6% and Latin America up 3%. We also saw a return to growth in EMEA, which was up 1%. Adjusted operating income of $532 million increased 9%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 6% with the adjusted operating margin declining 50 basis points in the quarter.","As we discussed last quarter, RIS margins were impacted by a tough comparison on the expense side. For the six months, revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 14% or 9% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 4% for the first half of the year. We are pleased with the first half performance in RIS.","In the second quarter, Consulting revenue was $1.7 billion, up 4% both including and excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. Underlying revenue growth was 1% for the quarter with 2% growth in Mercer partially offset by a 2% decline in Oliver Wyman. Adjusted operating income was $267 million, decline 5%. Adjusted operating margin declined 140 basis point.","In the quarter, we saw a further decline in Mercer's Defined Benefit Consulting business, mainly due to softness in project-related work in the U.S. and UK and lower new business wins in the UK versus last year. DB Consulting is a solid margin business within Consulting, and the decline in the quarter did have a meaningful impact on earnings and margin. As we've said previously, the DB market is not a growth area. We may have periods of positive growth, but DB is on a mid to longer-term declining trend.","DB is an important part of our overall wealth business. The DB business provides a sizable pool of assets which helps drive growth in investments and defined contribution. While underlying growth in Defined Benefit Consulting was down 6% in the quarter, the investments business grew 12% producing 1% growth in wealth overall. When we look at the first six months on an underlying revenue basis, Mercer is up 3% with health up 4%, career up 6%, and overall wealth up 2%.","Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue declined 2% in the quarter. Despite solid growth across most lines of business, we saw a decline in our U.S. financial services practice. This is primarily due to reduced volume of regulatory-related work for financial institutions. Based on our outlook today, we expect Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth for the second half of the year to be essentially flat with some variability among the quarters.","In the aggregate, our results for the first half of 2018 met our expectations. For the full year, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong adjusted EPS growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. In the second quarter, we delivered 3% underlying revenue growth highlighted by strong underlying growth of 5% in both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Overall revenue was up 7%, or 6% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, ASC 606. For the first six months of the year, underlying revenue growth was a solid 4%.","Operating income in the quarter was $691 million, while adjusted operating income increased 4% to $754 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 2%. Overall, our adjusted operating margin declined by 70 basis points excluding the impact of the new revenue standard.","GAAP EPS rose 8% to $1.04. Adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.10. Excluding a $0.02 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS grew 8%. For the first six months of 2018, our GAAP EPS has risen 16% while our adjusted EPS has increased 19% to $2.47. Excluding a $0.16 per share benefit from adopting the new revenue standard, year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 11%. We continue to believe the new revenue standard will be neutral to earnings for the full year.","In Risk and Insurance Services, second quarter revenue was $2.1 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $532 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 6%, and adjusted margin declined by 50 basis points.","For the first six months of the year, revenue was $4.4 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 20%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 9% with adjusted operating margin flat year-over-year at 26.7%.","At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with strong underlying growth of 5%. For the first six months, revenue at Marsh was $3.4 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 6% while international was up 1%.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $332 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 5%. This is the sixth quarter in a row of 4% or higher underlying growth for Guy Carpenter. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $1 billion with 6% underlying revenue growth. Strong year-to-date growth is benefiting from solid new business and strong retention in all major business lines.","In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion with underlying growth of 1%. Operating income increased 1% to $267 million and adjusted operating income decreased 5%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, the adjusted margin declined by 140 basis points.","As Dan mentioned, earnings and margins were impacted by softness in Mercer's DB Consulting business and Oliver Wyman's financial services practice in the U.S. Consulting's underlying revenue growth for the first six months of 2018 was 3% with consolidated revenue of $3.3 billion. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was up 1%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 2%.","Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth grew 1% on an underlying basis. Within wealth, Investment Management & Related Services increased 12%, while Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration declined 6%.","Our delegated asset management business continues to show strong growth with assets under delegated management of $242 billion at quarter-end. Health increased 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter. Recall though last quarter's 7% growth benefited from favorable timing that came at the expense of the second quarter. For the first six months, health's underlying growth was a solid 4%.","Career underlying growth continues to be strong and was 7% in the quarter. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.3 billion with 3% underlying revenue growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $492 million in the quarter with an underlying decline of 2% primarily due to a reduction in regulatory project works in U.S. financial services. For the first six months of the year, revenue was $1 billion with 2% underlying revenue growth.","Adjusted corporate expense was $45 million in the quarter. As we noted last quarter, we expect the consolidated margin will be down in the third quarter due to a tough expense comparison in Consulting and up in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect margin expansion and strong EPS growth for the full-year 2018.","Turning to investment income, on an adjusted basis, we had $2 million of investment income in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income in the remaining quarters of 2018 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was $28 million in the quarter and this includes mark-to-market adjustments required by the recent change in accounting for certain equity investments.","In this quarter, we saw meaningful benefit from these mark-to-market adjustments while last quarter they were negative. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we have excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as a noteworthy item.","Foreign exchange in the quarter was an immaterial positive to overall NOI. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level, we expect FX to be a slight headwind to NOI for the remainder of the year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 25.2% compared with 28.6% in the second quarter last year. Our adjusted tax rate included a net benefit of $6 million from discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%.","Accounting for equity awards had no impact on the second quarter following a $0.04 per share benefit in the first quarter. And we do not expect any material benefit for the remainder of the year. This is substantially lower than the $0.15 benefit we saw in 2017.","Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 24.3% compared with 25.9% last year. For the remainder of the year, we expect our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, will be at the high end of our guidance range of 25% to 26%. This is consistent with the underlying effective tax rate we have seen through the first six months of the year.","As we said last quarter, the U.S. tax reform legislation is new and there is a possibility that there will be further guidance from the U.S. Treasury and others on the interpretation or application of the new rules. This could result in adjustments to our estimates as we move through the year.","Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $6.3 billion, essentially unchanged from the end of March. Our next scheduled debt repayment would be in October 2018, when we have $250 million of notes maturing.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares of our stock for $250 million. Through six months, the company has repurchased 6.1 million shares for $500 million. This quarter marks the 25th consecutive quarter we have repurchased shares. And since announcing the commitment to reduce our annual share count in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 44 million or 8%.","Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled $592 million and included $250 million for share repurchases, $194 million for dividends, and $148 million for acquisitions. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.1 billion and included $500 million for share repurchases, $383 million for dividends, and $257 million for acquisition.","In May, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.375 to $0.415 per share, an increase of 11%. For the full-year 2018, we continue to expect to deploy at least as much capital as the $2.5 billion we deployed in 2017 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We are delivering on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double-digits.","With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Ryan Tunis, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I guess just thinking about on the Consulting side, it sounds like you're a little bit surprised with what happened with Oliver Wyman. Does that change in any way, I guess, your four-year margin outlook? Are we still right to think though that Oliver Wyman doesn't have quite as much of an impact one way or another on margins? From quarter-to-quarter, I think, that used to be the at least guidance you gave.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Ryan. That's true. What we've said in the past is that Oliver Wyman should actually outgrow the aggregate of the other three operating companies over time but with more volatility and that it's more revenue related than earnings related, although it does have an impact on earnings. In good times, we get more earnings; and in rougher times, we don't. It's important to note that Oliver Lyman's five-year CAGR on an underlying basis is 6%. And so it is our strongest grower over the last five years, but there will be periods of volatility.","And it's important to isolate \u2013 not only for Oliver Wyman, but for Mercer as well. Both Oliver Wyman broadly and Mercer broadly actually are doing very well year-to-date. They have specific issues in businesses, FS in the United States for Oliver Wyman and the DBA business in the U.S. and UK for Mercer. I'm not trying to understate the importance of us dealing with those issues over time, but fundamentally the broad spectrum of what each of our Consulting businesses engage in are doing quite well.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","So, I guess, thinking about the full year outlook, it's still for margin expansion. It sounded like you were a little bit \u2013 these are my words, but it sounded like you're a little bit more negative about the DB administration, maybe you were \u2013 the Oliver Wyman issue. Should we read that to think that there's probably some other areas that you now feel a little bit better about from an organic revenue growth standpoint headed in the back half of the year, and if so, what areas would those be?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I mean, I think there's plenty of things in Consulting to feel good about. As I was just saying before, the breadth of what we do in Consulting is doing quite well. In fact, I mean, I don't want to make excuses about businesses that are underperforming and we have to find ways of getting value from the DBA business and FS in the United States. Both are actually high quality, strong business with good professional colleagues, and they deliver us quality returns over time.","The DB is different because, as we've mentioned before, DB is not a growth business. There is not new business in DB emanating from new DB plans or new DB formation. New business in DB is essentially project work on existing plans. And so that's going to be a declining business over time. Did it decline a bit faster in the first quarter or the first and second quarter than our expectation? First quarter was around our expectation. Second quarter was a little steeper, but that doesn't necessarily make it a trend. We'll just have to see how that goes over time.","But when I look at the overall business, there's a lot for us to be excited about and that's why we clearly are saying that we're on track for another solid year. I mean, if I look through six months of this year on an overall company basis, we've grown 4% underlying. It's better than the 3% underlying that we did last year on an overall company basis. And we've done 11% adjusted EPS growth. So we are absolutely on track to deliver a good year with margin expansion for the overall company and with strong adjusted EPS growth. Next question, please?","Operator","Next question is from Kai Pan in Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. My first question just follow-up on the DBA discussion. We have seen weak organic growth in the segment for about like, let's say, two years now. So, do you think it's a structural issue or it's a competitive issue for you guys? And do you think that when we will possibly reaching a bottom in that?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. No, it is absolutely a structural issue. This is not a cyclical issue. Defined benefit pension plans, I doubt anybody on this call has one that's open. So, these are frozen plans that are essentially in a long-term, 25-30, 35-40 year runoff basis. And so these are declining businesses but of high quality which adds value to other businesses. So, clearly, a benefit in our investment business, which, as you saw, grew 12% this quarter, is its linkage with our DBA business.","But the only thing on a market competitiveness would be more along the lines of what's the mix of business and maybe the large accounts sector and certain types operates with more stability than the upper-middle market. That is to be determined over time, but the reality of the DB business is that it's on a long-term declining trend.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I do wish I had one open one. My follow-up question is on the Marsh simplification initiatives. So, could you tell us a little bit more about what exactly you're doing? And the $80 million to $100 million like restructuring cost, how much savings we expect from it and how much will be reinvested, and how much will flow through the bottom line?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Sure. I'll now hand off to John in a second, but there are certainly going to be some efficiencies that are derived from the restructuring activity. And some of that cost savings is going to be flowing to the bottom line. We're not going to give a specific number at this stage as to what's going to flow into the bottom line. I mean, fundamentally, the world is changing pretty fast. We want to get out in front of it in areas like digitalization, et cetera. So, part of our strategy is to free up some capital so we can accelerate investment in some of these critical areas. We have a strategy of investing as we go. But that doesn't mean from time to time we don't want to drop more money in because we see more opportunity. But, John, do you want to give us a little bit more on that?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure, Dan. So, Kai, we continue to execute on our effort to simplify our structure. Dan mentioned earlier we'll have fewer layers or leaders will have increased spans of control. That's part of the effort. We're going to have greater consistency in how we're organized around the world. There will be increased focus on the three client segments we serves: our large risk management clients, the middle market or corporate accounts as we call it and the small commercial and consumer segment.","We expect to be simpler, more agile, and we're pushing decision-making authority closer to the client. And as Dan said, the effort is also about enabling us to accelerate some investments in support of our strategy. The areas of investment are our digital capabilities, data and analytics, strengthening our middle market or corporate accounts value proposition. We're going to be adding some talent in key growth areas. And we also expect to continue to invest in our MGA operation.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Kai. Next question, please?","Operator","It's from Elyse Greenspan in Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, you guys posted pretty impressive 8% organic growth in the U.S. and Canada this quarter. I was just wondering if we could get some additional color on what drove that broken out by the U.S. as well as Canada. How significant was MMA contribution to growth, if you could also update us on the size of MMA today? And did the contingence that you accept on a portion of your business \u2013 was that a driver of the growth as well? Just any color so we could understand the pretty impressive number.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Elyse, that was a great, single, multipart question. So I hope we \u2013 if we don't cover them all, then circle back, and let us know what we've missed. But I'm going to hand off to John in a second. But obviously we're pleased with Marsh's overall growth in the quarter, and Guy Carpenter as well. So, RIS had a strong quarter, and obviously the 8%, we're pleased with as well. John will give you a little bit more color. I don't really want to, quarter-by-quarter, get into sub details of each of the segments within U.S.\/Canada, but we'll give you something certainly for this quarter. So, John?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure, Dan. So, Elyse, we were pleased with the quarter, as Dan mentioned. The growth in the U.S. and Canada was pretty strong across the board. Marsh in the U.S. had double-digit new business growth. Cyber, transaction risk, construction activity, all contributed favorably to that. Our West Coast operation had a particularly strong quarter as well. In Canada, we had an excellent quarter of growth.","MMA, we had pretty consistent growth really around the country. We had a particularly strong growth quarter in benefits at MMA. So, that contributed favorably to the overall results. Contingence at MMA are not a \u2013 it's not a huge part or huge driver of our overall activity. We saw a little bit of an increase in contingent revenue in second quarter.","And then the other part that I would say in the U.S. that contributed nicely to the result was our MGA operations. Dan mentioned that we organized and rebranded our MGA operations under the new name of Victor led by Chris Schaper with a particularly strong quarter in the U.S. as well. So, overall, it was a good quarter.","On the international side, the results were improved over the first quarter and over the second quarter a year ago but still were more mixed. Real strong growth in Asia. Latin American and Pacific had solid quarters. We had good growth in Continental Europe and in Africa. But the UK and the Middle East remain some pressure points. Last quarter, I mentioned we have new leadership in both the Middle East and in the UK and I'm excited about \u2013 it's obviously early days but I'm excited about some of the changes they're making to improve the results.","But we'll still see some pressure in the UK, particularly over the course of the rest of the year. So, it was a good quarter. As Mark mentioned, through six months, our underlying growth was 3%. Cautiously optimistic about the second half, particularly in the U.S, but again we'll see some headwinds from the UK in the second half as well. And I think MMA annualized run rate right now is around $1.3 billion.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks, John.","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I think I got all of them.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Elyse, you have a quick follow-up?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. My second question on margins. Last quarter, you guys had said that you expected the deterioration in the Q2 to be driven by RIS and then in the Q3 you had tougher expense comps. I'm just trying to tie that together. It does seem like Consulting margins deteriorated a bit more than you would have thought this quarter. So, is, I guess, that still the case? And for your full-year margin improvement, is that going to be driven more by RIS which seems to be running stronger? Are you still expecting margin improvement in both segments for the year?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Let me take that part first. I mean, we haven't given up on the year by any measure in either segment on a margin basis, but certainly margin expansion for the year will be driven by RIS because of its stronger top line performance and some of the dynamics within the business. Now, we see continued opportunity for operating leverage in the future in both segments. Whether it occurs this year or not, we'll just see as time goes on. As we've said before, we focus more on earnings growth. And over the long-term, earnings growth will be more of a function of what we do on the top line than anything else.","And so what Mark said last quarter, just to revisit that because seasonality is a little different for us this year, was that last year was a little odd for us. We had anticipated some softer top lines. We really pulled some expense levers. And so in the second quarter of last year, RIS had 0% expense growth. And so we expected RIS's margins to be under pressure for this second quarter. The strong growth that they had really came through to absorb a lot of that as well. That actually was a bit of a hurt to RIS as well on the margin side in the second quarter.","So, what we've said about the third quarter is Mercer's expense growth in the third quarter of last year was a minus 2%. So, they've got a tough expense comparison for the year. But what we're really focused on in Consulting is top line and getting better growth activity on the revenue side. And as I was saying to Ryan earlier, it's important to look underneath the hood at the full Consulting business because Mercer actually is having a very solid year year-to-date when you take out the DBA business and look at that in an isolated way as being a declining business that we have to get out in front of and manage in a different way. But if you exclude that, they're up 6% or 7% year-to-date in the other segment.","And in a similar fashion, Oliver Wyman is up something like 8% year-to-date when you look at the \u2013 taking out the FS business in the United States. Now, we would never take out our DBA business or our FS business in the United States. These are two important solid businesses, but it's important to isolate them every once in a while just so you can see exactly what's going on more broadly within these divisions. Next question, please?","Operator","Next question from Larry Greenberg in Janney Montgomery Scott.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you and good morning. Yeah. You just kind of touched on some of what I was going to ask about on Oliver Wyman. But can you frame for us how big the U.S. financial services business is for them on a relative scale? And then are we going back to a more normal environment in terms of regulatory-related work versus a heightened environment a year ago? Can you just give us some color on the environmental factors?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks for the question, Larry, and I'll hand off to Scott in a second, but, I mean, obviously our FS business is a big business because if all the other pieces of Oliver Wyman are doing quite well, and they were negative overall, it shows the size of that business. And all you have to do is read the newspaper, and you realize many financial institutions have sort of gotten out from under the continued high scrutiny regulatory activity that's been the case over the last several years. And so yes, we may be going to a more normalized environment with other growth opportunities with financial institutions but perhaps that's changing. But, Scott, do you want to add some to that?","Scott McDonald - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Larry, I'll give you a little more color. I mean, the FS business has always been a great business for us. It's less than 40% of the overall business now, and the U.S. regulatory business is only a part of that. Overall, it's probably less than 10% of the overall Oliver Wyman business. And in Q2, what we saw the end of was really this large wave of stress testing, and recovery, and resolution planning programs that the banks have gone through. And we knew that was coming and we've been actively working to transition to other areas.","Those include a number of strategic areas around growth, business evolution, culture organization, technology, digital, advanced analytics, customer experience, as well as a number of replacement risk and regulatory focus, things like cyber risk, liquidity risk, financial crimes and combat. And we're pretty optimistic about that transition. We've done that many times over the last 30 years, but it's going to take us a few quarters. And as we go through that process, I think, there will be some volatility in the results.","But once we finish that, I think, we'll be back on track. We're still targeting. We're still very confident in generating mid- to high-single-digit growth for the business as a whole. So, I think there has been a structural change there but that's nothing new for us, and many times in the past we've replaced that with other business.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Larry, any other follow-up?","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. Yeah. Just quickly. Dan, I interpreted what you said on the Wortham acquisition as that is not part of MMA Agency. Is that correct or am I wrong on that?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","That is correct. I mean, we felt \u2013 when the team \u2013 we've been having discussions with Wortham for quite a while. We've gotten to know them very well over many years. And, culturally, they align more with Marsh than they do with Marsh & McLennan Agency. They skew a little bit higher. Although they do have some middle-market business, they skew into the upper-middle market in the large accounts space. They're very good in specialty areas like energy. They work on some big accounts. It's more of a team dynamic organizational relationships, that sort of thing. And so, we felt it was a better cultural fit. And, as you know from our acquisitions in the past, cultural fit and culture and that kind of chemistry between teams is one of the areas that we really look at and highlight and focus on. And we just felt they were a better fit for Marsh than MMA.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Next question, please?","Operator","Next question from Meyer Shields in KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. So, Dan, one quick question on the Consulting side. Just with regard to the responsiveness of expenses to the revenue shortfall, can you talk about how that compare to your expectations?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","I mean, it's a fair question overall in terms of when you look at the expense base of the company because clearly Consulting \u2013 we, for many years, have been able to, in most quarters, grow revenue at a faster pace than expenses. That is a philosophy of our company. Clearly, it won't happen in every quarter, and obviously in this quarter, Consulting is upside down. It's tough when you have 1% growth overall not to be upside down, right, and 1% is kind of an anomaly for us in Consulting.","But we look at our expenses very carefully. I mean, one of the things to consider what I think is a bright spot within the company is the notion that in a people business, comp and benefits is always our biggest driver of costs. It's always the largest portion of cost of goods sold. And so, if we look at our comp and benefits ratio as a percentage of revenue, they're basically flat across the company, which means we're doing a good job managing our comp and ben regardless of the revenue over the course of the last few quarters. And so that to me is a positive.","If you look at Consulting's operating expenses, there's a lot going on, so let me unpack it a little bit because obviously you'll see some growth in their operating expenses. Both M&A and FX are fasters and both contributed to an uptick in expenses in the quarter. Another big driver was sub-adviser fees in our investment business. I mean one of the things you have to recognize is our AUDM is up more than 25% year-to-date.","And so the fees we pay sub-advisers which run through our operating expenses are up materially or meaningfully. Legal fees are also up due to work that we're doing on our M&A pipeline, also some of the CMA stuff that we've done. So, my view is the challenge for Consulting in the quarter was more about revenue than about expenses. We have proven over time that we know how to run a business on the expense side and we will continue to do so.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. No. That's helpful. I really appreciate it. Second question, you touched on insurance under-penetration earlier in your prepared remarks. Can you drill down a little bit in terms of how you see the industry responding whether it's affordability or other issues to what is clearly some under-penetration?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I'll hand off to John and if Peter has anything to say about it as well. But, certainly, you can just look around the world and see indebted governments who are providing post loss catastrophe protection using taxpayer money that they may not have, right? One of the biggest buyers, not just the developed world, one of the biggest markets of under-penetration for as an example flood insurance is the United States. But, John, why don't we start with you and then we can go to Peter if Peter's got something to add. So, John?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. I mean, we see opportunities to develop product and distribution capabilities in small commercial segments of even mature economies as you pointed out, Dan, here in the United States. So, our acquisition of ICAT last summer was an important part of really trying to drive more nat cat type coverages into the small business environment. Torrent, of course, is another example of a business that we have that's got a great flood expertise and now administering the NFIP program as well.","You talked about Victor, as well Dan earlier. Victor is largely phased off as is Dovetail with the small commercial market, and we see smaller businesses maybe bought packages around the world but now are facing cyber risks, for example, renewal risks. And so, that's an important and growing part of our business. So, it's often been talked about in emerging economies and emerging governments. But as you say even within more mature markets around the world, we see an opportunity to expand product density into some of these customer segments.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Peter, do you have anything to add?","Peter C. Hearn - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Meyer, if I just look at our public sector business, which we broadly define as state, federal, local, provincial, sovereign entities that are de-risking the taxpayer, as a standalone business, it'd be the sixth biggest business within Guy Carpenter. So, we're seeing strong growth in that area as there's more and more pressure on governments to de-risk the taxpayer. And we've seen it certainly in the United States. We're starting to see it in Europe as well.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","So, Meyer, the age of risk has just begun. We know what we know and that's underpenetrated. There's been a lot of risk that we don't know that are yet to come, and we will be involved. So, next question, please?","Operator","Next question from Yaron Kinar in Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. I want to go back a second to the DBA business. Just to maybe set my expectations. I think you're talking about a stable decline, and yet you're also saying that 1Q 2018 was probably more in line with your expectations. Even if I compare 1Q 2018's revenue decline to 2017 and 2016, it seems like the decline has accelerated. So, I just want to better understand what stable decline means from your perspective. And on top of that, are the revenues that you're replacing this lost DBA revenue with \u2013 are you able to achieve similar margins on the replaced revenues in other businesses within Consulting?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Sure. So, I'll take that a little bit, and then I'll hand off for Julio for more color. I'll say a few things. First, on the margin point, DBA is a large established business with high margins, right? So, some of the growth industries that Mercer has invested in, over time, we anticipate will have similar margins at some point in the future, but they do not do so at this moment in time.","The other thing I want to say about DBA and defined benefit in general is if you look broadly the topic of retirement security is fundamental. The best retirement security products have not even been invented yet. So, it's not \u2013 completely think that this is just a downward trend forever, that there won't be other things that get developed to help solve the challenge that's a major issue globally for an aging population. And so there will be other types of approaches, and Mercer will be very involved in those kind of other approaches.","But, Julio, why don't you talk a little bit about how new business is created, and the types of things that happen, and therefore sometimes if you have more project work, maybe the overall revenue suffers a year or two later, but...","Julio A. Portalatin - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Right. So, let me, if I can \u2013 thank you for that, Dan, but I'd like to just talk a little bit about the panoramic view of growth in general. So, Dan mentioned a little bit of it before. We're pretty encouraged by some of the investments we've made to drive growth, and some of them you all are very aware of whether it's in talents (50:43) online or in software associated to that, Mercer Marketplace 365, digital implementation practice, which is doing well, workforce analytics and delegated investment solutions, which we talk a lot about already.","Now, the dynamics of the DB business, we've been managing quite well for a long period of time. We got great people, great consultants doing great work for our clients. That success includes creating great value for our clients, de-risking, providing advice, glide path, vendor's eye (51:12) to investment consultancy and delegated solutions. Now with that, that means that some of that work results in less programs over time, less DB programs over time due to DB plan termination and less project work that's associated with those programs. So when things happen that allow for de-risking work to take place, naturally DB programs start terminating.","So, on the flip side though, it still results in some really good growth as a feeder to our investment business and other businesses. So while new business opportunities can ebb and flow, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of opportunities that could be presented by regulatory changes, interest rate fluctuations that hopefully increase funding levels and can generate demand for de-risking over time.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yaron, any other follow-up?","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Just I guess to clarify before, the follow-up. So, it sounds like maybe there's just some project that's ebb and flow that's affecting the first half results or maybe causing a little more pressure than usual.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","That's correct.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then, the second question I had real quick one on the simplification initiative in RIS. Are there any cost saves that came in the second quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","John?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Cost saves in the second quarter, no.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No?","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","No. So, much of the effort as we began to execute on and separate some talent came very late in the quarter.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. And then...","John Q. Doyle - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","No impact on the bottom line.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","And also you said simplification in RIS. It's actually a Marsh simplification as opposed to RIS.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Next question from Dave Styblo in Jefferies.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Hi, there. Good morning. Hey, Dan, when we were on the road on last time, you spoke about sort of a framework for long-term EPS growth and something if you're growing organic growth around 3%, that that's reasonable to think about a 10% EPS grower. And then as you scale that up to 4% or 5% over time, EPS growth obviously looks better than that.","I'm just curious, with the strong results in U.S.\/Canada and that looks like EMEA is bouncing back a little bit, can you talk about some areas that gives you more confidence about being able to eventually push organic growth higher? I think UK was one of the pressure points. Can you just give us an update there since U.S.\/Canada seems to be doing quite well right now?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. So, a few things. I think the point that I've made before is that our long-term adjusted EPS growth over time will be more determined by the top line than margin expansion in the future. I mean, when you look back, you go back a decade ago or so, it was about margins, right? And we had to improve our margins and we did that as a firm and a lot of our adjusted EPS growth was driven off of margin. This has been the aftermath of a financial crisis. And so it has been a long, slow growth GDP environment globally. A little bit better now, but it's certainly not buoyant. And as we've said before, GDP is one of the determinants because it's a big determinant of exposure units. GDP, payrolls, et cetera.","So, it's a bit better in the U.S., but the rest of the world, as an example, is not materially better than it was over the last couple of years. And so when I think about adjusted EPS growth over time, yeah, I think around a number like 3%. You're not going to be driving for mid-teens types of adjusted EPS growth. In fact, it would be counterproductive in your business to do so. And so that's essentially trying to deliver strong results whatever those turn out to be. And as we start growing 4%, 5%, 6%, that's when we can start pushing into the 12%, 13%, 14% type of adjusted EPS growth. And these are all the long stretches of time, not any one quarter, not any one year, but that's our view.","I certainly believe that the company's capability of growing is better than 3% and we've been sort of in this 3% or 4% range for a while. Now, we need some other things in the world to cooperate, but ultimately we have been shifting our mix of business. We have been favoring acquisitions that are growing faster than we are. We are looking at all kinds of opportunities, for example, in RIS in the mid corporate and the small commercial place. So we have a multitude of different approaches to drive better revenue growth. And with better revenue growth, we'll have better adjusted EPS growth.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Helpful. Okay. And then for my follow-up, I hate to come back to it but the DBCA business for the softness. I guess the biggest question investors want to get their arms around is could this get worse as you move into the second half and beyond? Can you \u2013 I think two of the reasons you talked about was just soft project work and then less new wins. Maybe on the back part of that, is it less new wins just because there's less going around or are you not winning as much as you historically have?","And then looking back, you did start to give us a segment breakdown I think going back to 2016 where growth was flat that year. It was down 2% last year. Are you guys able to give us what the organic growth profile looked like maybe going back into 2015, 2014 and 2013 just to understand has it been this low before and does it just tend to bounce around from time to time?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think you need to really focus on defined benefit in terms of what it actually is. At the end, defined benefit is with regard to pension plans. And if you look back into history, the further you go back in history, the more that there would be new formation of DB plans, active DB plans. That has \u2013 as you know, we've become a defined contribution world. There is not many new DB plans available.","There's other activity in that area. I mean, if you look at the development within Mercer of the investment business, the investment business is far stronger than it was five years ago and certainly 10 years ago, but it has gone from strength to strength. One of the values or feeders of assets into our investment business comes out of our defined benefit engagements. But you can't think of this business in a way that says, okay, that this is going to be a growth trajectory on defined benefit consulting. That's just not a reality. And that we've been talking about that essentially for more than a decade frankly.","And so this is a long \u2013 I mean, people are living longer, healthier lives than any time in human history. And so many DB plans that thought they were going to run off over 30 years may run off over 50 years. So, this is going to be a big business for us for a long period of time, but it's not necessarily going to be a growth business. When growth happens, it's based upon project work as Julio was saying before.","So, I think we've dealt with DB enough. And you guys can go through a bit of research about defined benefit plans. As I was mentioning before, we are actually quite pleased with Mercer's overall performance. And even with DB underperformance or growth issues they're 3% year-to-date within Mercer. And in terms of how we feel about the next couple of quarters, we don't expect the Consulting division to be a 1% grower from here on out. We expect that it will go better than that.","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Okay.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","So, next question please?","David Styblo - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Next question from Mike Zaremski, Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. Regarding the disclaimer on the tax rate could potentially change based on guidance, I appreciate that's a complicated bill but I was hoping maybe you could shed light on whether we should be thinking the long-term tax rate is biased higher or lower. And I guess related, there's been a number of companies \u2013 the multinational companies talk about the BEAT tax impact in outer years, and kind of curious if we should be thinking about that as well.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks. Mark, you want to take that?","Mark McGivney - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think our estimate of the higher end of that 25% to 26% range for this year contemplates everything that we know at this point. And we've actually had six months to work through the particulars of the bill and see our geographic list of earnings and things like that. So we feel like we've got good visibility for this year. In terms of longer-term, there's so many factors that can influence our rate \u2013 tax law changes aside, that really our guidance does go year-to-year.","So, I won't give you \u2013 I don't have a really good perspective on longer-term at this point. And in terms of the language, it is still very new and it is a very complicated bill. And there is the possibility that, as I said, the U.S. Treasury or others could come out with different interpretations of a very complicated bill that for global companies like us involves a lot of decisions. But as we sit here today, we feel good about the rate that we're projecting for the rest of the year.","Things like BEAT \u2013 it has no impact on us this year. The targets of those types of provisions, like earnings stripping type behaviors, really was not part of our technology. And so, at this point, we think we'll be able to deal with any of the provisions that have potential to impact this year's factored into the rate guidance that I gave.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And one quick follow up. Dan, you mentioned, in terms of the restructuring charges, in terms of being able to accelerate investment. You mentioned increasingly going digital, and I guess it just kind of remind me of this insurtech word, which seems to be \u2013 get a huge buzz these days. From my top-down perspective, I'm honestly not sure if most of the headlines are noise, or if they're adding real value. Maybe if you can talk from Marsh's vantage point, if you can offer color on whether insurtech is something that you think is \u2013 you guys are investing and looking at, or will be a material impact over the coming years?","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Sure. We could probably spend an hour on that one. So, I'll try, in our next call, to address it a little bit more, but just very quickly. Yes, absolutely. We're very engaged with insurtech activity. We want to improve our peripheral vision. We are working in all kinds of different ways in order to do that. Yes, we periodically see something that we want to either have a partnership with or even make a small investment into. The insurance industry remains inefficient in some parts of the value chain and whether you're looking at policy issuance, claims process, et cetera. And so, there's a lot of interesting things going on in the insurtech space that may bring value to our clients. And so, yeah, we are absolutely engaged in that.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I just like to hand back over to the speaker today, Dan Glaser.","Daniel S. Glaser - Marsh & McLennan Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.

Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Duperreault","Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our results as reported earlier today. I'm Brian Duperreault, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Dan Glaser, Group President and COO; and Mike Bischoff, our CFO. Also, I'd like to welcome our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and John Drzik of Oliver Wyman. Following my comments, Dan and Mike will discuss our operating results and financial position in more detail.","Our second quarter results were excellent and indicate our continuing progress in establishing Marsh & McLennan Companies as an elite enterprise. Across all our operating companies, we generated revenue growth and higher levels of profitability. In the second quarter, underlying revenue growth was 5%. Combined with ongoing control of expenses and effective capital management, we produced growth in adjusted operating income of 13% and earnings per share of 22%, an outstanding performance.","Marsh produced another strong quarter. All major geographies contributed to revenue growth of 6%, driven primarily by new business development. Guy Carpenter produced underlying revenue growth of 10%, led by its international operations. The Consulting segment delivered strong underlying revenue growth in the second quarter. Importantly, Consulting adjusted operating income increased 40%, reflecting strong performance of both Mercer and Oliver Wyman.","When we established our long-term performance targets 2 years ago, we understood the challenge and the level of commitment required since very few companies our size have been able to produce double-digit earnings growth over the long term. Since we announced these goals, Marsh & McLennan has been successfully meeting these long-term earnings targets. While we may not achieve double-digit earnings growth every year, we remain confident that we can produce this level of growth over the long term.","We understand that to achieve these goals, we need to continuously improve performance through investments in our business, our technology and our colleagues and to make decisions that will enhance long-term growth. This ensures that we will be conducting our business in a way that provides value to our clients, stimulates and rewards our colleagues and delivers consistently strong returns to our shareholders. So in closing, we're very pleased with the second quarter and the results we have produced in the first half of this year.","With that, let me turn it over to Dan to review our second quarter results.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Marsh & McLennan Companies continued to produce excellent financial results. For the eighth consecutive quarter, we achieved underlying revenue growth at each of our operating companies. Risk and Insurance Services revenue was up 5%, with underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income rose 14%, and the adjusted operating margin improved 200 basis points.","The double-digit growth in profitability and the margin improvement reflect the exceptional performance of both Marsh and Guy Carpenter. For the 6 months, we achieved 110 basis points of margin improvement. At the same time we produced these results, we continued to make significant investments to enhance client service, improve efficiencies and strengthen our competitive position.","Marsh produced another strong quarter. Underlying revenue rose 6%, with all geographies contributing. Latin America increased revenue 14%. Asia Pacific grew 10%. EMEA grew 5%, and the U.S.\/Canada division rose 4%. Marsh's revenue growth reflects $281 million of new business in the second quarter. This is the strongest quarter of new business in Marsh's history.","Guy Carpenter also produced strong results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 7%, and underlying revenue growth was 10%, driven by growth across its international operations, including global specialties, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. This now extends the trend of Guy Carpenter producing underlying revenue growth for 14 consecutive quarters. As we look at current conditions in the reinsurance marketplace, with July renewal pricing showing signs of stabilization for property catastrophe coverage and risk retentions by several of Guy Carpenter's key clients increasing, we expect only modest revenue growth in the second half of the year for Guy Carpenter.","Turning to our Consulting segment. Revenue was $1.3 billion, with 4% underlying revenue growth. Our second quarter results show that we continue to make progress in increasing profitability, as both Mercer and Oliver Wyman contributed to the segment's double-digit growth in earnings and a significantly higher operating margin. Adjusted operating income rose 14% to $176 million, the highest level of quarterly Consulting earnings in our history. The adjusted operating margin increased 140 basis points to 13.1%. For the 6 months, adjusted operating income grew 18% and the adjusted margin rose 160 basis points to 12.7%.","Mercer's second quarter underlying revenue growth was 3%. Results reflect increased revenue across all regions, with strong growth in Asia and Latin America. Looking at Mercer's underlying revenue by line of business: Investments grew 7%; Health & Benefits increased 6%; while Retirement, Outsourcing and Talent, Rewards & Communications grew modestly.","Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the North American region in the consumer and health and life sciences sectors. Based upon current market conditions, Oliver Wyman expects only modest underlying revenue growth in the third quarter.","In conclusion, we are very pleased with the results our operating companies produced in the second quarter. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Consolidated revenue was $3 billion in the second quarter, with an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income rose 13%, and the adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 17.3%. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% to $0.60 on a GAAP basis. Adjusted earnings per share grew 22% to $0.61. This is notable given weak economic conditions, low interest rates, foreign exchange headwinds and the ongoing investments we are making and continue to make in our businesses.","Interest expense was $45 million in the second quarter compared with $49 million last year. The only debt maturity we have over the next 2 years is the $250 million senior note in February 2013. As we discussed last earnings call, our corporate expense this quarter is higher than normal. This is primarily the result of accelerated amortization of senior ex equity awards. This will that be an issue for the remainder of the year. Investment income this quarter was $4 million compared with a loss of $6 million in last year's second quarter. In the third quarter, we anticipate reporting an investment loss of approximately $5 million.","Now turning to capital management. Our cash position at the end of June was $1.5 billion. In deploying our excess cash this quarter, we used approximately $70 million for acquisitions and $100 million to repurchase 3.1 million shares, and this was primarily to offset the effects of equity grants. Since December of 2010, we have repurchased 18.7 million shares for approximately $550 million, with $450 million remaining under our current board authorization. Another major use of cash in the quarter was $121 million for dividends.","With the continuing European financial crisis, we wanted to give you an idea of the magnitude of Marsh & McLennan's European revenue and how conditions are affecting the results of each of our operating companies. As you're aware, we breakdown Marsh's revenue on a geographic basis, and you can see, for both the second quarter and the year-to-date, that Marsh's revenue growth on an underlying basis in EMEA was 5%. But we wanted to give you a little bit more richer detail with regard to our European position and revenue. So in total, the company generates about $12 billion of annual revenue, with approximately 1\/3 of this coming from Europe. Our U.K. operations, which represent approximately 1\/2 of our European revenue, continues to perform well.","Now let's look at our recent results. Of Marsh's $5.4 billion in annual revenue, approximately 1\/3 is in Europe, with 45% coming from the United Kingdom. Marsh's revenue in the U.K. rose 6% for the second quarter and the first half of the year. New business production was particularly robust in the U.K. in the second quarter. For continental Europe, Marsh's revenue grew 4% in the quarter and 3% for the first half of this year.","About 1\/3 of Guy Carpenter's $1.1 billion in annual revenue is generated in Europe, and the U.K. accounts for more than 75% of this revenue. And Guy Carpenter's U.K. revenue rose double-digits for both the second quarter and the first half of this year, driven by its global specialties. Continental European revenue growth was modest in the quarter and year-to-date for Carpenter.","Now turning to our Consulting segment. Mercer's European revenue over the past year was $1.1 billion or about 30% of Mercer's global revenue. The U.K. represents just over 1\/2 of Mercer's European revenue, with low single-digit growth for both the first and second quarters. This was true as well for Mercer in Continental Europe.","So even though European economic conditions have been difficult, 3 of our 4 operating companies have continued to generate revenue growth in Europe. Oliver Wyman has the greatest exposure to Europe, with approximately 40% of its revenue coming from European clients. Over the past 3 quarters, Oliver Wyman has experienced modest revenue declines in this region. But as you can see from our second quarter earnings release, Oliver Wyman has produced excellent overall results in spite of the continuing weakness in Europe.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Brian.","Brian Duperreault","Thank you, Mike. Operator, I think we can start our question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And I'll take our first question from Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess the only thing, if I want to nitpick, the plus 4% in the U.S., which is down a little bit, but still better than your peers. If maybe you could talk to that. And in the context of your new business comment, either Dan or Peter, what are you guys doing? Is it more how well your clients are recovering in the large case part of the market versus the smaller end of the market? Or is it new, new business? You're actually going out and winning accounts, if you could talk to that. And then I've got a follow-up for Julio.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So Peter, do the 4% U.S.","Peter Zaffino","Yes. Overall -- again, when we report the U.S., there's several segments that are within the U.S. and Canada division. We're very pleased with the growth that we've seen in the core U.S. brokerage business. And the trends have been very steady from quarter-to-quarter and expect that to continue through the rest of 2012. To answer your question in terms of -- I think what you're asking, Keith, around the overall growth is, we've had very strong client retention across the world, we've had very strong rollover from new business last year. We have had record new business in the second quarter, which has grown around 10% year-over-year. We're executing on our initiatives. There's been less of a headwind in pricing in 2011 in the second quarter, there were headwinds. We're seeing some slight uptick, certainly, in property and other lines of business that are a little bit distressed, so I look at excess casualty and some workers compensation. So that's affected the U.S. And overall, as Dan said in his comments, we've grown in every part of the world, so we have a nice balance. And when you've done all of those things together, you get good organic growth.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then for Julio, the improvement at Mercer, we can see it already. You guys did a nice job, given us some of the European sensitivity there. But can you just give us an idea, what's the plan to protect margins against potential declines in Europe as we head into 2013?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, sure, sure, sure. Thanks, Keith. First, I want to say that I'm pretty optimistic about Mercer's profitable growth prospects moving forward. Any business where you are in a mission to promote the health, wealth and performance of companies' best assets, which is, of course, their employees, I think puts you in a good position for the future. So you add Mercer's global footprint, its innovative added-value solutions, and I think we're in good shape. But as you look at calibrating and always looking at what our revenue growth is going to be across the world, we see opportunities that are popping up in different places. Europe might be slowing down, but we have a good business in other places, like in the emerging market world. We want to, obviously, have even more footprint there as time goes on, and I think that's going to really give us some good uplift in the future. Additionally, again, keep in mind that we have some businesses that perform very well in down times and others that don't. And 70% of our business is annuitized; 30%, of course, is program- or project-oriented business. And as we continue to flip that and get more of the annuitized business and less of the project business, I think you'll see that we'll be able to continue to calibrate growth pretty well in the future. Now that said, any time that we're looking to make sure that our margins continue to expand, we have to be very disciplined on the expense side. We continue to do that, and we'll always make sure that, that is calibrated appropriately to what our revenue expectations are.","Operator","We'll move on to Dan Farrell with Sterne Agee.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Could you speak generally to the impact of currency in the quarter 2 results? And then also, do you happen to have the GAAP pension expenses running to the results in the quarter?","Brian Duperreault","Michael?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, thank you. If you look at foreign exchange, you can see on our earnings release that the currency impact was about 3% negative with regard to revenue. That indicates that we're converting most of our major currencies: the pound, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar into a stronger dollar. And as a result, not only did it have a negative impact on revenue, but it had a modest negative impact on our operating income, shared equally between Insurance Services and Consulting.","Brian Duperreault","There was a question on...","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just pension expense.","J. Michael Bischoff","With regards to pension expense, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, gross pension expense would be about $30 million higher for the entire year, and gross impact would be in the low- to mid-20s. And that, obviously, is equal over the course of the year. So in this particular quarter, pension expense -- when we file our 10-Q, gross pension expense, we show about $9 million more than it did in the second quarter of last year.","Dan Farrell - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one additional question. With regard to Consulting margins, can you talk about how much Mercer versus Oliver Wyman is driving margin improvement? Are both of those driving margin expansion? Then, on the Oliver Wyman piece, to the extent that you're seeing a revenue slowdown there, are there levers to continue to push margin improvement?","J. Michael Bischoff","Okay Dan, I'll answer the first question, which is that both of the components of the Consulting segment are driving good margin improvements, so it's across the board. But John, do you want to comment anything on Oliver Wyman?","John P. Drzik","Sure. Well, on Oliver Wyman margins, I'd make -- I'd divide your question into 2 parts. So one is if we experience revenue weakness in one geography, as you are, for example, in Europe now, it doesn't really affect our overall margin because we run our capacity on a global basis. So for example, in the first half of this year, a lot of our people who are based in Europe would have been deployed in the United States or other geographies where growth was stronger. So what really affects -- would affect our margin is aggregate global revenue weakness rather than weakness in any particular geography. And when -- and we have levers to pull in those scenarios as well. So as long as the revenue pattern is a modest decline, we have disciplined compensation programs in place that reacts with respect to revenue decline, so there shouldn't be a substantial margin decline.","Operator","That will come from Morgan Stanley, Greg Locraft.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just go back to Europe because it is a big concern in some subset of the investment community out there. And I guess, what you've highlighted is that it's really 15% of revs that are at risk. And I guess, is there a decline in that 15% of the business that would jeopardize your double-digit operating income growth goal?","J. Michael Bischoff","Well, let me try this, Greg. I think when we outlined -- decided to outline Europe, we wanted to show that it's too simplistic to say 1\/3 of our business comes from Europe because Europe is an interesting, diverse area, and a large portion of that's coming out of the U.K. And so you have to -- if you're trying to decide the impact of Europe, you have to first understand how the business is spread around and not just geographically, but by component, by our operating companies and segments because the Insurance business acts differently than Consulting, certainly, in recession periods. So there's much more continuing revenue that gives us a ballast against economic changes. So I wouldn't say it's 15% at risk. I mean, everything is at risk. But I think what we're trying to point out is, we have, I think, the last 12 months or so, been experiencing issues in Europe and still, have been able to handle that. We believe we can continue to handle that going forward. And I think, as John said, unless it's some overall, complete meltdown of the global economy, we feel comfortable of that exposure. So I think Dan also wants to add something.","Daniel S. Glaser","I'll just say a couple of things. One, even if you go back 5 years ago or so, Europe, continental Europe was not a high-growth area for us. So it was a low to mid single-digit growth area, and it's remained pretty much a low and single-digit growth area. Our global network really benefits us quite a bit because while European companies might not be doing all that well in Europe, they are doing as anybody else on -- with their multinational footprint. So we're working on French companies around the world, Spanish companies around the world, and you often hear a refrain when you visit these companies about how they're not doing well in their local market, but they're doing quite well outside of their local market.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Greg?","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. And then any quick updates on the CFO search process that's under way?","Brian Duperreault","Well, thanks for asking that question because it gives me the opportunity to thank Mike who's done a terrific job and continues to do a terrific job as our CFO. So yes, we're still -- we're in the interview phase. So things are progressing nicely. I feel very good about the process, and I don't think I'll say anything more than that.","Operator","Next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With total organic revenue growth in 2Q of 5% and the company facing some comparison headwinds in Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman on the organic revenue growth front, what should we be thinking about in terms of overall organic revenue growth in sort of the back half?","J. Michael Bischoff","Well, what we've told you is 2 of the operating companies who had pretty good results, 7% and 10%, they're not going to have those numbers in the second half. We're not saying anything about the other 2, and there's a balance to everything. And I don't live and die on the pure organic growth number. It's managing your growth and your revenue and expense through the ups and downs, the cyclicality, seasonal cyclicality where the third quarter isn't that strong for Marsh. But we don't expect that we would have issues with respect to our bottom line, and we think we'll close out the year well. We have a goal of double digit. I firmly believe that, that's a goal that we can achieve. And so we're not -- I'm not just -- we're not talking about the rest of the organic growth, but the fact that we have a goal to make a bottom line, and we believe we can do that.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- in the Consulting segment, with the 13% margin in the second quarter, clearly, an improvement versus a year ago. Should we expect continued improvement in the second half on the Consulting margin?","J. Michael Bischoff","Well, again, I want to reinforce that our goals have been a growth in our operating income, growth in earnings per share. I'm -- I don't -- so each of the operating companies, each of the segments, they have -- they know what they need to do. They know what the kind of growth requirements we have, and so with respect to Consulting, John and Julio know what's expected of them. And so we would expect that they'll manage through this year and the next accordingly, that may produce good margin improvements. But the important thing for us is they produce those double-digit growth in earnings.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on share buyback that sort of resumed in the second quarter after, I believe, no buybacks for the prior 2 quarters, what's your outlook there?","Brian Duperreault","Well, our policy about that is that we will buy back shares through capital management, if we don't have alternative uses of that cash, basically for acquisition. So we would prefer acquisitions, I would anyway, because I think it's more accretive long term. We have the minimum that we would buy back shares so that we don't dilute with our compensation issues. But past that, I think it's more what opportunities present themselves, and actually, I prefer that those opportunities come in the form of acquisitions. But if not, then we would increase our share repurchasing.","Operator","Moving on to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'd like to follow up on that, if I can. Does the turmoil in Europe present any increased opportunity on the M&A front?","Brian Duperreault","Well, that's an interesting question because that's -- usually, the source of great opportunity is when there's trouble. And so yes, I guess, that's a possibility. I'm not signaling anything here but yes, certainly, a possibility. But we've -- our acquisition approach has been more targeted to areas where we want to fill out that we're not as robust as we need to be. That could be geographically, also in capabilities. And so if those opportunities emerge in Europe, they'll have to get in line and meet the criteria that the other ones are meeting or exceeding. So -- but yes, certainly, that's a real possibility.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify something. If you've got a Spanish client that's doing well in Latin America, sort of their subsidiary, does that revenue growth show up in EMEA or Latin America for you?","Brian Duperreault","That would show up in Latin America.","Operator","Moving on to Ray Iardella with Macquarie.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","So I guess maybe for Peter. Thinking about the new business growth in Marsh and the record quarter that you guys had, is there anything in particular you guys are doing on that side to drive that growth? Any new products or anything you can talk to?","Peter Zaffino","Well, thanks Ray for the question. Certainly, the first and foremost is execution. We have a very strong pipeline, strong coverage on our global sales. We introduced, years ago, something called Marsh 3D, which is define, design and deliver, and that really takes us through a thorough risk management approach in making sure that we're assessing every opportunity. We've had a strong focus on growing share of wallet, connecting our multinational network and where we can grow market share from clients that we already have. And taking advantage of being a global organization. We behave as one firm, and there's great opportunities to collaborate and bring the strength of the organization together. The investments that have been made over the years in terms of industry and specialty expertise, there's a flight to quality. When it's more difficult to place business in a very challenging market, we've seen an uptick as a result of that. And we're having more robust discussions around analytics and how we can be more thoughtful in terms of recommendations around volatility. We expanded our own analytical platform to be able to do more stochastic modeling, do more cap modeling on the larger accounts. So that has given us opportunities for growth as well.","Raymond Iardella - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick numbers question, I guess, for Mike. Just to confirm, the operating income had a negative impact from FX on -- in both segments?","J. Michael Bischoff","That's correct.","Operator","From Langen McAlenney, Larry Greenberg.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","I was just wondering if you could quantify or give us some order of magnitude the impact of pricing underlying commercial lines pricing on your revenue growth.","Brian Duperreault","Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. Pricing, again, it's a long answer if we went segment by segment. I won't do that. But you do have to look at geography, line of business, each of the segments and then look at the year-over-year performance. When you start to take a look at what's the line affected most, it's property. So world peak zones, cat exposed, loss impacted business have seen the biggest rates. In the U.S., property is the one that stands out. 60% of our clients saw a rate increase, but 40% saw either no increase or were modestly down. You have to look at total insured values. Those are starting to move, again, very modestly. Excess -- I mentioned before, excess umbrella and lead D&O pricing is starting to move modestly, but the excess layers are still very competitive. And then workers' comp in the U.S., based on the pressure of the accident years, we've seen that go up in the mid-single digits. You have to shift overlooking into the international. EMEA and Asia Pac, generally speaking, if you take the peak zones out, pricing was flat to down. And we feel the same way about Latin America, where pricing conditions were predominantly slightly down. When you take all that together and look at the overall index that we have published with our top 20 countries with the top lines of business that I just covered, we've seen around a 1.4% increase in price. So I think that's had a modest impact in the overall 6%. But I'm not going to give a specific as to what that contributed. But again, I said, in 2011, it was a headwind, and it's a modest help in 2012.","Brian Duperreault","Alex, do you want to -- I was going to answer, Peter, by the way. Alex, do you want to add to that?","Alexander S. Moczarski","I won't be as expansive as Peter. Essentially, we calculate -- the effects on our results were about 2 to 2.5 points in the second quarter. And that effect is diminishing since it's a pretty benign year compared to the first 6 months of last year. And obviously, we're in the windstorm season, so we don't know how that will play out. But yes, we'll take the points, and we'll see what happens in the second half of the year.","Operator","That will come from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you touch on whether the operating strategy within Health & Benefits is evolving in light of the Supreme Court decision, including whether Marsh will move forward with the health care exchange initiative, as, I believe, some of your competitors appear to be doing?","Brian Duperreault","Yes. Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks. Thank you for the question. We could talk for a long time about this topic because it's obviously a very appropriate discussion these days. But first, let me just level set a little bit. Health care reform requires the states set up their own health exchanges or partner with or use the to-be-created federally facilitated exchange. To date, there's been about 16 states that have indicated that they will create their own exchanges, 7 have said that they will not and another 16 are still studying their options. The remaining states appear to have taken kind of a \"let's wait and see\" or \"no significant activity\" approach. States have to submit a blueprint to the federal government by mid-November if they want to move forward with an exchange by 2012. Otherwise, the federal government steps in. So establishing these exchanges is a very complex undertaking for the federal government, as well as it is for states. And they need a lot of help and assistance, and that's where Mercer's coming in. And a lot of individual subsidies and employee penalties are subject to if, in fact, you don't move forward with the degree of pace as outlined in my earlier comment. Our primary role in all of this has been to provide expertise and advice to states on developing their perspectives and helping design their strategies. So far, we've worked with several states, and we expect additional work with those and more over the coming months. We're also spending a lot of time helping our corporate clients understand and prepare for these regulations. We're working with our employer clients as they manage through the complex reform, provide advice and solutions, and we're partnering with carriers as well on new products that can help employers lower the cost of health care through the use of high-quality networks and customized care management. One offering, in particular, is the Mercer Health Advantage, which is getting good response in the market, and we expect to have about 500,000 enrolled -- employees enrolled in this and similar plans for 2013. So this whole area is evolving very quickly, it's exciting. I think Mercer is well positioned to play a leadership role in the evolution of it. I also want to add one more note that we've launched most recently, the Mercer Marsh solution, which brings both the added-value, client-facing solutions for the market of both Mercer and Marsh. And that's moving quite nicely as well.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I mean, would you say, to a certain extent, that Marsh is taking a \"let's wait and see\" approach just because there's a lot changing?","Julio A. Portalatin","In terms of exchanges, you're referring to?","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Correct.","Julio A. Portalatin","I wouldn't say wait and see. I would say, be part of the solution and move forward, and that's the approach I would like to take with this. I think we have to make sure that we calibrate the opportunity with the investment necessary to take advantage of the opportunity as time goes on. And I think we're doing that quite well right now.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, a follow-up to Jay Gelb's earlier question. Could we get an update on what type of M&A opportunities Marsh is most focused on? And Brian, I recall last quarter you mentioned adding components and capabilities that Marsh didn't have. I'd be interested in what those capabilities would be.","Brian Duperreault","Well, first of all, we're -- the M&A activity, I guess begins with the Marsh agency. We've been spending a lot of time on that. And I think we have about $70 million spend in the quarter. Some of that was agency, some of that was continuing to spend for the African acquisition that we made. So there -- Marsh is getting its fair share of this to expand both its capabilities in the U.S. and geographically. We didn't have anything else in the quarter for the other operating companies. But what we've done typically is, say, in Oliver Wyman, finding a segment. I mean, our life sciences segment, which is growing dramatically now, really started a few years ago with the acquisition. And so trying to find a group of people who have the capability in an area that we're not as strong in would be a typical acquisition on Oliver Wyman. And I think you would continue to see that going forward. In Julio's case, well, there's -- I could pick a number of things. I mean, we've got a number of segments that he has, that whether it's investments where we've made investments in the past to fill that out or it could be geography, too. It's hard to be specific, because if I had one, I could tell you about it. So you just have to take the general comment that it's filling in areas that we feel we need to fill in.","Operator","We'll move on to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. The first is, I didn't quite catch this, when you talked about Oliver Wyman in the second half having more modest growth, what was the rationale behind that?","Brian Duperreault","John?","John P. Drzik","So Jay, I think there's 2 reasons for it. First, we're expecting the weaker economic conditions in Europe to continue. So as we mentioned, we're experiencing a revenue -- have been experiencing a revenue decline in Europe in the first half of the year, and we expect that weakness to continue into the second half. Now on the first half of the year, that was offset by very strong growth in the U.S. market, and we're expecting that growth to taper a bit, so therefore, the overall growth rate would come down, say, from the 7% in the first half to something in the low-single digits for the second half, and it's principally that. There is a second reason which has a modest effect, which is, in the Q1 call, we explained that we have timing of revenue from contracts with acceptance provisions that occurred earlier this year, and this boosted our Q1 growth but will actually lower our second half growth, particularly in Q4. So that's the second effect.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then secondly, I guess related to Europe, my recollection is a lot of the European business -- as I recall, I think it is in Marsh -- gets done early in the year and maybe that's true with Consulting as well, I'm not sure. As you're looking out towards the first half of 2013, given the environment which doesn't feel like it's getting much better over there, is that the bigger risk when you look in the first half of '13?","Brian Duperreault","Let me start, and then I think you guys could fill in. But yes, the insurance is sort of front-end loaded in the year, early part of the year. That's not the case in Consulting, which is spread much more evenly throughout the year. We've pointed out that Marsh had pretty good results, certainly, in the first half of this year, both in the continent and in the U.K. And so I would say we're not overly concerned about the renewal season.","Daniel S. Glaser","There's a few things. There's a lot that goes into what organic revenue looks like in all geographies, but in particular, in Europe. So you have to first start with, \"Okay, what's going on with GDP? And is the economy growing? Are exposure units growing?\" And then you would say, \"Well, what's happening with regard to rate? What's happening with regard to client retention? What's happening with regard to negotiations with carriers over commission yields? And then what's going on with new business?\" So there's a number of factors that are at work that you aggregate them together and come up with your organic growth number. I mean, we think -- there's a few things, particularly on the insurance side. Companies in Europe will continue to buy insurance as of January 1, and that can be the announcement. So Europe is -- while they're in difficult times, in some ways, having insurance protection with quality carriers and a top-quality intermediary is more important than when times are buoyant.","Brian Duperreault","Okay, Jay?","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. I appreciate that.","Operator","That will come from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Margin expansion in Risk and Insurance Services was better in the second quarter than it had been in the last couple of quarters. Is that partially attributable to strong growth at Guy Carpenter? And what else is driving that?","Brian Duperreault","Dan, why don't you do that?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. We're talking about margins in general. As Brian pointed out earlier, our first focus is growth and growth of actual profit, our earnings and looking to do that on a double-digit basis in more years than we don't. And then we also, obviously, look at margins. So it's kind of like organic growth, earnings and then margins. And when we look at margins, we start with both segments, not just the RIS segment, and we're -- our expectation is, over the next several years, we will improve margins in both of our segments. And we'll do that for a variety of different ways, but most specifically, by calibrating expense growth with revenue growth and being very alive to what's happening on revenue week by week and month by month in calibrating our expenses accordingly. When we look at our RIS, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we're making a lot of investments. Those are not quarter by quarter as being perfectly timed, so you see some level of ebb and flow on the cost of investments that roll through and the cost of strategic recruitment, et cetera. And so that all is playing itself out. Overall, we think our margins in RIS are strong; I think, through 6 months, may even be market-leading. But on the basis, we do believe we will improve them over time. And -- but I wouldn't read into this quarter versus last quarter, because we don't manage our business that way. As we've described about Consulting in the past, we expect more out of the margins in Consulting over time because the margins in Consulting through the recession had gotten lower than they've historically been. So we are on a path back to our historical performance.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","One follow-up. The growth in the U.K. was clearly strong, but the U.K. has been slowing down economically in the last 6 months or so. Are you a bit worried about that?","Brian Duperreault","Well, there's a couple of things about the U.K. A very significant chunk of our business in the U.K. on the RIS side is global business that comes to the U.S -- to the U.K. for placement. And so that's really a global phenomena, as opposed to U.K. only. When you're looking at U.K. only in specific, you're really looking, more often, on the RIS side as Marsh's retail business. And that's actually been performing well. You're very right to point out that the U.K, like a lot of places in the world, are struggling with overall growth. We have not seen that affect us to date, but we're very watchful and mindful of that.","Operator","And that will come from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Retirement, Health & Benefits were flat over the first quarter. But Outsourcing year-over-year slowed, and Talent slowed. I'm just trying to understand kind of what happened there and how should we think about that. And just one follow-up.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes. On the Outsourcing front, you may have recalled, in the last quarter, I talked about us benefiting from some of the year-on-year comparisons in the first quarter because of business that had been secured the year before. And I think in the second quarter, we felt a more year-on-year likely comparison, I guess, between last year and this year. And we see Outsourcing continuing to be a support for our core businesses, and we'll continue to manage it that way as we go forward. I think what you see as far as growth pattern is very much within expectations.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on the Talent side?","Daniel S. Glaser","Talent is being impacted, of course, mostly from the discretionary side of the project work that we do. There is a proportion of our business in the talent world that, obviously, is project-oriented and very much related to how corporations and clients are spending and their spending behaviors. And certainly, Europe would be one of those places where we've seen a bit of a slowdown on the discretionary projects. We -- on the opposite end of that, we've seen some good revenue growth in other parts of the world that's offsetting a bit of that challenge. But that's some of the headwinds that we're seeing, and we hope that, that will continue to recover as time in the year goes on.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one -- I'm sorry, if I could, one more. Brian, is that okay?","Brian Duperreault","Yes, please go ahead, yes. I was going to ask you to.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then Oliver Wyman, you kind of talked about. It sounds like the driver of the expectations for slower growth on the back half of the year are not Europe, actually, it's the U.S. and what may be happening there. I guess, my question is, what's happening outside of the U.S. and Europe in terms of Oliver Wyman? And how is that part of the world and part of the business doing? And within the U.S., what exactly drove other than these contracts that you maybe talked about in the last Q and just mentioned briefly here? What else happened to cause that spike in activity?","Brian Duperreault","Okay, John.","John P. Drzik","Yes. So let me take the U.S. part, first. I mean, the fastest-growing segments we had in the business in the U.S. and globally were our health care business and consumer business, so that accounted for the spike. Now those businesses jumped up quite a bit in the first half of the year, so it's not that we're projecting adverse conditions for the U.S., it's more that we don't expect the growth to offset as much as it did the European growth. So we still expect to grow in the U.S. in the second half of the year and grow at quite a healthy pace, but probably, not at quite the same rate as in the first half. But it was driven by health care and consumer, principally in the U.S. In terms of outside the U.S., in Europe, about 15% to 20% of our business falls into that category, and it's been sort of a mix of different outcomes in different regions. Our business isn't large enough in any one region to say decisively. It had -- certain regions have been growing faster over a long period time. If you look just at 2012, which is perhaps your question, we've been growing better in the Middle East, in Brazil, in Russia and not as strongly in Asia. So that's been this year's pattern. But again, the businesses aren't large enough that the pattern changes from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.","Brian Duperreault","So let me close this by saying that we had, as I said earlier, an excellent quarter, and we couldn't have that without the hard work of our 53,000 colleagues. So let me take this opportunity to thank them for their great work and also, thank all of you on the phone for your interest in Marsh & McLennan. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Glaser","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of MMC.","Joining me on the call today is Mike Bischoff, our CFO; and our operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh, Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter, Julio Portalatin of Mercer, and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.","The business world is changing rapidly, and we continue to see examples of disruption and discontinuity. We believe Marsh & McLennan Companies is well positioned in this environment. We are global leaders in the areas of risk, strategy and people, and these areas all have great relevance to our clients. We are defined by deep specialization and united by a common purpose: doing meaningful work that makes a difference for our clients, colleagues and shareholders.","We are industry innovators and thought leaders, proud of our heritage of advising clients on complex challenges. Many organizations ranging from multinationals to regionals and small firms, both public and private, are affected by issues such as heightened cybersecurity risk, political and economic uncertainty, increased regulation and slow economic growth. In this increasingly complex and dynamic world, the need for advice and services is rising. Our competitive positioning as a trusted adviser to our clients has never been stronger. Our proposition for shareholders remains unchanged. We are a global growth company with increasing capital flexibility. We continue to invest for future growth, and we have a proven leadership team known for keeping its commitments.","I am pleased with our operating performance in the first quarter, especially considering global economic pressures and a softening P&C insurance market. We posted underlying revenue growth across all operating companies, margin improvement in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share. We continued to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases.","Like other U.S. multinational companies, we are faced with challenges presented by the current global economic environment. In particular, we are weathering substantial headwinds from low interest rates and the strong U.S. dollar.","As we discussed on our last conference call, our mitigation efforts primarily impact the first quarter, resulting in a net benefit to EPS of $0.03 in the quarter, and Mike will give you additional details. MMC's overall underlying revenue growth was 4% in the first quarter, and I am optimistic about our ability to continue to drive underlying revenue growth in both RIS and Consulting.","Looking at our RIS segment. Revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $546 million. At March, revenue was $1.4 billion. Underlying growth was 3%, with all major geographic regions contributing. Strong new business drove the revenue increase.","In the U.S.\/Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan Agency. The International division also expanded 3%. EMEA rose 2%. Asia-Pacific grew 5%, and Latin America increased 6%.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was $368 million, up 2% on an underlying basis. Growth in Global Specialties led the way, primarily marine and Lloyd's Property.","In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.4 billion, up 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $247 million, an increase of 9% from the prior year.","Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, an underlying increase of 4%. The revenue increase was spread across all major geographic regions, including solid growth in Europe and growth markets. Good revenue performance was aided by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth for investments at 13%. While Talent contributed 4%, Health was up 3% and Retirement was flat.","In February, Mercer made a $75 million strategic equity investment in Benefitfocus, significantly expanding the relationship with Mercer Marketplace, our private health exchange. Together, we are driving innovation within the Health & Benefits industry.","Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $384 million, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. Revenue increases were achieved across all industry sectors. As expected, the rate of growth decelerated from the double-digit growth rate produced last year.","In summary, even excluding the $0.03 net benefit from our mitigation efforts, we produced strong EPS growth and margin expansion in both segments. In 2015, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and high-single-digit EPS growth. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS at a 13% CAGR over the long term.","With that, let me turn it over to Mike.","J. Michael Bischoff","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. Revenue growth exceeded the increase in underlying operating expenses for the 18th consecutive quarter. GAAP EPS rose 10% to $0.88, and adjusted EPS increased 12% to $0.91.","As we discussed on last quarter's call, results this year are being impacted by 2 macroeconomic headwinds: the decline in global interest rates and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our estimate is that higher retirement planned expenses and foreign exchange should impact earnings per share this year by approximately $0.30. The effects on our quarterly results will vary. In the first quarter, these macro headwinds impacted earnings by approximately $0.12.","As anticipated, we made changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical program last month. This medical benefit was eliminated for most colleagues more than a decade ago. The net result of the 2 headwinds in this mitigating action was a benefit to operating income of $23 million or $0.03 per share. Looking forward, if foreign exchange rates remain at their present levels, we estimate the impact of the 2 macro headwinds will be $0.08 in the second quarter, $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.04 in the fourth quarter.","It also helps to look at the net impact of these items by segment. In the first quarter, the mitigation almost completely offset the macro headwinds in the Consulting segment and had a positive impact on profitability and margins in the Risk and Insurance Services segment. In the second quarter, the headwind should impact Risk and Insurance Services slightly more than Consulting. In the third and fourth quarter, about 1\/3 of the headwinds are expected to impact the RIS segment, with 2\/3 impacting Consulting. So as we progress throughout the year, it may be best to look at profitability growth and operating margin improvement on a year-to-date basis.","We expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be similar to last year. And as the year-over-year impact to the macro headwinds dissipates, we expect EPS growth in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half.","We think it is important to share this level of detail in order to give the investment community insight regarding the net impact by quarter and by segment of the macro headwinds, our overall business plans and our mitigation actions. I would like to reiterate what Dan said earlier, we expect to generate high-single-digit growth in earnings per share this year.","Investment income was $2 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $11 million from a year ago. Investment income is expected to be de minimis in the second quarter unless there is a change in the status of Trident III. Corporate expense was $44 million, in line with our anticipated quarterly expense level.","Over the last several years, we appreciate our debt portfolio. Our most recent transaction was in March, when we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes. As a result of these actions, our average cost to debt has declined substantially, for example, from 5.1% in the first quarter of last year to 3.4% this quarter. Our next debt maturity is a $50 million term loan due in March of next year.","Our cash was approximately $260 million in the United States. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past 6 years; $300 million to repurchase 5.3 million shares of our stock; $151 million for dividends; and $140 million for acquisitions and investments.","With that, I am happy to turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks, Mike. So Jamie, we're ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the EPS outlook, I just want to confirm that the starting point, that high single-digit EPS growth rate is $2.82 for full year '14, which is the adjusted number.","Daniel S. Glaser","That's correct, Jay. That's correct.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The other thing that caught my attention in the quarter was the pace of the buybacks, $300 million in the quarter. Can you talk about why that accelerated in 1Q and what the implications are perhaps for the rest of the year in terms of buyback?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Well, if you go back to last year, we returned between acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase $2.35 billion to shareholders. And we made the comment in our last call that we would expect this year to be at least that amount. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to return value to shareholders through those 3 actions. And when we look at it, our overall feel as we go forward would be that you'll see us over time reducing cash on the balance sheet, increasing our level of leverage over time and putting that leverage -- increased leverage to work for our shareholders. And so our expectation in terms of share repurchases and acquisitions are similar to last year, although acquisitions is one of those things that you can never really quite time. And share repurchase, to us, would be a very good use of our money and certainly superior to growing cash on the balance sheet.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my final question was, with regard to the first quarter, the offsetting benefit of closing the retiree medical plan, my sense is that had a benefit even on the adjusted operating income, especially for RIS. Is it -- can you provide us with sort of a normalized margin for 1Q relative to the 30.3% that was printed?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, sure. When you look at our margins in general, I think what the -- it's smart to not only back out things like foreign exchange but also back out the mitigation aspect, particularly in the first quarter, because that's where it landed so heavily. Even if you back all of that out on an underlying basis, MMC's margin would have been up about 50 bps, and we would have had margin improvement in both segments.","J. Michael Bischoff","Dan, I think you meant Risk and Insurance Services margins would have been up about 40 or 50 bps. Consulting is fairly straightforward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, my first question is just on your organic growth in U.S. and Canada. I know you mentioned -- I think it was driven by MMA. Just curious what was the growth there in MMA and what were some of the other puts and takes maybe against that 3% in U.S. and Canada?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure, well, we're not going to start disclosing quarterly individual units within segments and calling them out separately. But Peter, you want to talk broadly about the U.S. and Canada division?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. I'll start, Dan, with why we call that MMA. And we have been communicating on our quarterly calls about the quality of acquisitions that we're making, the ability that we have in terms of being meaningful in the middle market and having a national platform. But in addition to making those acquisitions and bringing something very unique to our clients and to the market, we had strong organic growth. And so we're seeing the components of strength from acquisition as well as from organic growth. In the U.S. and Canada division, again, we have multiple businesses that roll up in the reporting, and MMA was the leader in terms of its organic growth. The one thing that we'll have within overall Marsh as well as the U.S. and Canada division was a weak new business in the first quarter of last year. So therefore, the rollover had some impact in the first quarter growth. But overall, the fundamentals of client retention, strong new business and the 3% in the U.S. and Canada in a mature part of the world we were pleased with.","Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess, my follow-up would just be the $500 million debt deal you guys did, does that change your outlook, I guess, in terms of what you think you can do for dividend acquisition and share repo for the remainder of the year?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike, you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, thank you very much. This is basically in line with what we've been doing over the last 3 years in essentially reshaping our debt portfolio, or as some people say, debt maturity ladder. We look at it over a number of years and we started to reposition our 2014 and 2015 maturities. And then looking at that, we wanted to essentially have a smooth ladder going out into the future. We went through about 3 years with keeping our actual debt essentially flat at around $3 billion. And then, what we've been indicating to the investment community as well as the credit rating agencies that as our earnings continue to grow, we will begin to bring up our overall debt levels in a sequential fashion. And so it's very much in keeping with our long-term view, very consistent with what we've been doing. If you look at it on a seasonal basis, where we need the cash, where we -- where heavily utilization of cash, all things being equal, is in the first quarter due to our annual payments for bonuses. And so when we're increasing our debt, most likely on an annual basis, it could occur in the first part of the year. So that's a long answer to something to say, no, it's very consistent with the multiyear strategy.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Jay's question on the margin expansion, especially in the RIS segment. Even you're excluding these foreign exchange and the pension impact, pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Is that sort of -- if you look at organic growth at 3%, is that an indication, when the organic growth is 3% or above, we should see some meaningful margin expansion for these segments going forward?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, well, I'll start by saying, for quite a while, we've sort of used 3% as the baseline and saying, if we can grow organically 3% or better, we believe that we should be able to achieve some margin expansion. I wouldn't say it quite the way you did, Kai, in terms of, at 3%, there will be meaningful margin expansion. I mean, clearly, whatever the delta is between 3% and a higher number creates more of an ability for us to expand margins. And if we're closer to 3%, we wouldn't really be driving at that stage for margin expansion. But Mike, do you have anything to add?","J. Michael Bischoff","Just more specifics on the first quarter for the clarity. When we looked at the margin improvement in Risk and Insurance Services for the quarter, which was 310 basis points, we knew that, that was affected by the benefit -- the net benefit of the closing of the retiree medical plan post-65 in the United States. And so that's why we wanted to give the investment community much more specificity on the first quarter. So the benefit -- the net benefit that we indicated, the $23 million, was felt almost completely in the RIS segment. And so that's what I was saying earlier. If you just say, based upon the underlying growth in the segment, what would be the organic growth and what would be the margin improvement predicated on that. And thus for the RIS segment, it would be in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 bps. In Consulting, it's a different situation. The net headwinds and the net offsetting items essentially netted out. It was actually a $2 million or $3 million hurt in Consulting. So the margin improvement of 160 basis points was more of a true margin improvement for the segment in this quarter, excluding the impacts of the mitigating items and the macro headwinds.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Then a follow-up on the, sorry, on the Health segment. The organic growth 3% this quarter and -- just trying to see your view on, because last year -- end of last year, you have pretty meaningful increase in terms of your Mercer Marketplace, the private healthcare exchange. Just wondering how those grows, which translate into organic growth, in particular in the Health segment?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio, you want to take that?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thank you, and thanks for the question. It allows us to provide some additional clarity and color around our Health growth, which we are actually very bullish on and I'm very pleased with. You might recall, a couple of years ago, we made an announcement that we will be incorporating our benefit admin business into our line of businesses. In this particular case, the Health and Benefits -- Benefit Administration business or Outsourcing was actually incorporated in our Health segment. And when we did that, of course, the results were -- have been actually pretty good, because we've been able to put profit improvement plans in place to improve our margins in that business. Part of that decisions -- part of those decisions that we make, of course, has to do with client and client retention, our ability to price adequately for the services that we give. So if you were to take the impact of some of the client retention challenges that we had because of anticipated action that we took to improve profitability in ben admin. If you were to take that impact out of the Health number, you would actually see what I think is a much more expected 7% growth. So our core Health, along with MMX, grew 7%. With the actions of ben admin, it impacted it to 3%. So we're very pleased, in fact. We had good performance in our Health business. We expect this to continue. Our client retention x ben admin is actually very strong, our commissions continue to increase. Mercer Marketplace will enhance this segment going forward. And it's important to keep in mind that we'll continue to invest in our exchange health business, because we think it's a robust environment for us to do so and to maintain our leadership position.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, just a couple of questions. One is, so on the buyback -- I mean it's great to see you comment about leverage, Dan, and the buyback there. I guess, one question is, looking now running at the $200 million to $300 million quarterly run rate, 1Q seasonally light because of operating expenses, do you expect -- or should we expect that -- or can we infer that -- I mean, we'll look to maybe increase leverage a bit during the first quarter to sort of supplement the seasonally light cash flows there and to kind of adopt the, or espouse a run rate near this level on buybacks?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I mean, I think the way you should look at it is more annual than quarterly. I mean, clearly, every year, we pay bonuses in the first quarter, and so it tends to be where we're cash light. And we have lots of items that -- and lots of ability to cover that. So that's not an issue. And as you see, we ended the year with quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet, including $260 million in the United States. And I would think, more over time, what you should consider is that we will be increasing our leverage over time and that by doing that will give us more capital flexibility, not only for share repurchase, but also for dividends and acquisitions. And we remain a very balanced player in those 3 areas. What I can be -- what you can infer from that is, is that our level of acquisitions will not necessarily impact our level of share repurchase that we're looking at really our ability to do more of each over time.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Great, that's helpful. And then just on kind of to square the margin and FX and high-single-digit earnings comment. So if we think about the organic growth kind of sticking at this level on RIS, maybe we'll continue to see that sort of 50 basis point margin expansion through the year. So to get to that mid-single-digit EPS growth, does that mean that Consulting margins should -- we should expect to see this level of margin expansion? Or just -- I'm just trying to mathematically think about how we square kind of those points?","Daniel S. Glaser","So the way I would look at it is first look at last year, right, because that flip is not switched. Switch is not flipped and everything is different in the new year. And so if you look at last year, we grew overall as a company about 70 bps in margin, and RIS grew 30 bps and Consulting grew 160. When we think about this year in terms of 2015, I think what you'll see is RIS will probably be pretty similar to last year and Consulting will come off a bit from 160 bps. We're not expecting that for the full year, but we'll have some corporate benefit, because our corporate initiatives that we had in the back half of last year are unlikely to recur. So we'll have some benefit there. So overall, we feel like we'll end up with pretty good margin expansion for the company in -- during the year of 2015.","Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, great. And then just the last quick one maybe, Julio, on the private exchange. Any update on enrollment from the last time we spoke? And one question I'd love to ask too is, thinking about like the employer size spectrum, I mean, can you talk about your initiatives or kind of hit rate in the sub-thousand or maybe mid-size or large on that front?","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Thanks for the question. As we've discussed in the past, it's our intention to give full updates of our Mercer Marketplace progress on a annual basis, it'll be towards the end of the year when we do that again. But I would like to remind of you a couple of things and maybe add some color to the size piece, because we did make some disclosures on that in the past. So as mentioned in the past, our total lives of eligible lives is over 1 million for both active and Medicare. And when you put those together, it's over 1 million. And when you add voluntary benefits and individual access mediums, we can add another 1.5 million or so. So we're up over 2 million when we talk about eligible lives. Mercer's U.S. Health and Benefits business touches millions of lives and gives us an opportunity to grow our exchange business over time as well as new prospects. We continue to have good interest from and dialogue with clients, both our current clients and new clients, both in the mid- and large-market companies, although we continue to see a little bit more momentum still in the mid-market versus the large market. And Mercer Marketplace has a key part of our future -- is a key part of our future, as you know. So if you look at some of the early adopters versus what our current numbers are, you'll see that in '14, we had about 67 clients. Now we have closer to 250 in '15. Talked about the number of lives already. If you break it down by client size, you'll see that nearly half of the clients that we have in our 2015 number is about, let's say, 5,000 or less on number of employees. So you still see a pretty good number of people going into the exchange that obviously are in the market space that is considered to be mid-market and below. And about 40% of our clients, by the way, would be somewhere in the area of over 5,000. But then again, when you look at jumbos over 20, it really drops considerably. So that goes to your comments earlier in terms of wanting more color as it relates to the size of the employees that we're currently having as part of our Mercer Marketplace initiative.","Operator","And we'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping to spend a little bit more time, I guess, on the acquisitions in light of your capital outlook for the year, a little bit lower in the first quarter. And I know if you guys can kind of just talk about what you're seeing in the acquisition pipeline, especially in terms of M&A, in terms of the MMA platform and if higher prices of deals have kind of caused you to walk away on that front, or just kind of what you're seeing there as we look for the balance of 2015?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. So I'll talk a little bit about acquisitions, and then I'll hand over to Peter to talk a little bit more about the pipeline within Marsh and in particular MMA. I think it's important to reiterate that our philosophy around acquisitions is that we have no budget or timetable associated with acquisitions. We work a pipeline and we develop relationships, and sometimes, it takes years to actually cultivate a relationship to where we then can have a discussion around whether they want to join with us or not. Our primary focus is on quality. We prefer companies that are growing faster than we are, that are trading at multiples below our multiples and where we can see that we can improve the business by working together. And from that standpoint, I might also say that we rarely participate in auctions. Auction environments -- they don't meet our philosophy, because actually, they're generally geared to optimizing the price for the seller as opposed to any kind of joining together of 2 different companies. So just to reaffirm, we develop relationships with really talented people over a long stretch of time. Now in terms of the multiples, I mean, it's clear over a number of years, there's been some expansion in multiples, generally fueled by low interest rates and the entry of many PE firms into the space. And multiples are important to look at, but it may be even more important to look at, well, what is the EBITDA, because these are private companies and you have to make assumptions around EBITDA. And sometimes, I would say that buyers can be far more optimistic about what those assumptions are than what we would be as a disciplined buyer. And so we also have to look at the projected growth rate. And from that standpoint, we're well practiced. As an overall company, last year was a fairly active year, and it added up to almost $1 billion worth of acquisitions. The pipeline overall for the entire company looks about the same. I'm not going to say it's fuller than what it was at this point last year. It's about the same. And we're working on some things that are consistent with our approach of a string-of-pearls strategy, where the average acquisition for us over the last 5 or 6 years has been around $40 million. And we're also working on some things that we would call more nuggets that might be a little bit more size, but those tend to take more time. And so Peter, you want to add in some on specifically about MMA?","Peter Zaffino","Sure. I think you summarized everything, Dan, for the organization, and it fits very well within MMA. We're working very hard to cultivate relationships. We don't have a budget, so it can be very lumpy from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year. And as Dan had mentioned, we very much focus on companies that can strategically position us differently, whether it's in a space like the SME or provide capabilities that we may not have. We made an acquisition of Torrent at the end of last year, which was a best-in-class flood servicing company with great technology. So we're very focused on making sure that we're cultivating those relationships. We tend not to be in a bid process. So in that cultivation of relationships, they tend to be just 2 parties involved. And if I can speak specifically about MMA and International, which is where we focus a lot of our acquisitions, we feel the pipeline is very strong for 2015. And we're optimistic that throughout the next several quarters, we should be able to move forward.","Daniel S. Glaser","Thanks. Elyse, would it be helpful if Julio talked a little bit about the investments that they've made where they haven't purchased 100% of a firm, but they've invested in Benefitfocus and Alexander Forbes?","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure, that would be great.","Daniel S. Glaser","Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Okay, thank you. Yes, it's great to be able to give some additional color on this, because as we've talked about in the past, we have some very pointed strategies on how we want to continue to expand our business. In the case of Alexander Forbes, as mentioned earlier, it was very important for us to be able to get much more of a foothold and much more of a footprint in the Africa continent. And, of course, Alexander Forbes provides that in a very meaningful way. It's part of our focus to expand our new capabilities in growth markets, and of course, in the Investments and the Retirement space as well. So our investment in Alexander Forbes really helps us do that and continues to help us move forward. Benefitfocus, we're very excited about. I mean, obviously, we have a big investment going on in our exchange business. And we bought $75 million of newly issued shares of Benefitfocus, representing 9.9% of outstanding shares. And quite frankly, we're really pleased with the partnership that we've developed with Benefitfocus. We're developing proprietary approaches to the exchange base, and we want to make sure that, that was preserved over a long period of time, sustainable for us to count on for a long period of time. And we made the investment there, and we're very excited about our partnership in developing new things. As we continue to also invest in our Investments expansion, SEM came available to us. And through a lot of discussions over a period of time, we were able to secure that acquisition. Of course, that supports our Investments business, especially in the alternative investment space. So it really expands us in that area, because our clients have been asking us to actually provide great solutions in that space, and that helps us in that area. So as you can see, all of these acquisitions are really very strategic and very much aligned with our strategic purpose. And we'll continue to look for opportunities just like those.","Daniel S. Glaser","Any other questions, Elyse?","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, if we can also spend some time talking on Guy Carpenter. 2% growth in the quarter, just how you kind of think about the growth you can potentially see there on an underlying basis for the balance of 2015, especially in light of some of the price declines you've been seeing in the reinsurance market?","Daniel S. Glaser","Sure. Alex?","Alexander S. Moczarski","Sure, thanks. So the first quarter was actually a little stronger than we had expected, and the second quarter may be a bit tougher. We can expect -- it is a moderate or slight to moderate underlying growth environment for us. We expect to grow over the year slightly, maybe even moderately. But the next quarter may be a little bit tough. And we may have clumpy quarters, because when you're in that sort of environment where the percentages are small, one quarter will be stronger than the other. But we do believe that we've got a good pipeline. We continue to innovate. We continue to be relevant. As there are more options around capital, we are agnostic to where that capital comes from, and our clients are looking for -- there's interest in unbiased but informed alternatives. We have been specializing, as you know. We've been segmenting. We opened up a Mutual Company Practice in 2013, the Excess and Surplus Line practice, the Cyber Solutions Specialty in 2014, Healthcare in 2014 and just announced the Public Sector Specialty Practice. So we continue to seek relevance. We continue to seek innovation. We've got strategic advisory teams around the world, helping companies grow, helping companies face increased regulation. So we're optimistic about our growth -- about continued growth this year, though, at a, as I said, slight to moderate pace.","Daniel S. Glaser","To sum that up, GC is doing a terrific job in specialization and segmentation, and all that hard effort enables them to eke out some level of growth in a low growth environment. And that's our expectations for the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dave Styblo with Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I think I'll flip the other side of the business on Marsh for the organic growth there. Another solid quarter of 3%. I guess, as I was looking at things, it's a little bit lower than any of the quarters last year. And obviously, the environment, as you mentioned, is a little bit more challenging. But I'm curious what you're seeing more specifically in the end market. Is there any sort of more material slowdown in activity or increased competition? Or on the other side, I'm just wondering if there's perhaps any sort of timing of revenue that might have been going on in the quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So I'll just take that broadly and then hand over to Peter. I think when you look at the segment overall, one thing to consider is that we -- for the last 17 out of 18 quarters, we have grown organically 3% or better. And so as you stated, we've had some periods of higher than that, but we've really done a good job creating that as essentially our floor in the segment. But Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Yes. I had commented on the United States earlier. So perhaps I'll just give a little bit of insight on International and its growth. First of all, we have a terrific International business. It's really balanced with strength across the entire geographical platform. But in the first quarter, it is heavily weighted towards EMEA. We had 2% growth in EMEA, 5% in Asia-Pac really led by Asia and 6% in Latin America. So there are couple of factors impacting the growth -- again, nothing to be concerned about. But we had modest renewal growth in the quarter, and that was primarily based on 2 factors. One is we had slow new business growth in the first quarter of 2014, so that had a slight impact on the rollover for 2015. And then pricing coming off a little bit more thinking mid-single digits led by Property in the International business had some impact. The real positives for us is that we had a terrific new business in the quarter. So we were up 7% in International. And in Continental Europe, we had 10% new business growth. And then in the U.K., we had 8%. Other strong performances we had, Africa at 15% and Latin America in double-digit. So we are winning in the marketplace. We are in a very positive way and a balanced way growing our portfolio through adding clients. And so we had a little bit of an impact from last year. Again, it's heavily weighted towards Europe and the U.K. So when you think about the macroeconomic factors and the slight impact, again, we had from rollover, new business and the rating environment, we were pleased with the performance.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sure, okay. Is it more appropriate to think more like a 3-ish percent organic growth for the year as opposed to kind of 4% to 5% clip you were at last year then?","Daniel S. Glaser","No, I don't think that would be appropriate. I think the way you should look at it is the overall company, including RIS and including Marsh, has been operating in a 3% to 5% organic growth area. And we're just as likely to pop out of that as we are to go underneath it. But 3% to 5% seems the more accurate way to look at it over a longer period of time.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a little bit more coming back to Benefitfocus. I know you started to highlight that. I'm just curious to get a better sense of the rationale for the investment. Obviously, you guys have been working with them for a while. What was the reason for needing to actually help make the investment in there? I guess, at one point, the company was burning through a little bit of cash. Was it just to the help the company out, make sure the business was [indiscernible] so that they could focus on operations? Or was there something new in terms of the expansion of the contract terms and things and services that they were doing for you that is part of this new relationship?","Daniel S. Glaser","I'll say broadly, and then I'll hand over to Julio, that we saw a tremendous opportunity to develop a closer relationship where we could collaborate more deeply. And we certainly weren't needed as a cash source for them. They had all kinds of different choices. And we are very pleased that we were able to make an equity investment in return for some cash. But Julio?","Julio A. Portalatin","Yes, thanks for the question. As you know, the importance of Mercer Marketplace is high on our list of priorities. It's -- Mercer Marketplace is our proprietary benefit exchange solution. It's powered by Benefitfocus. And our relationship has flourished. We now serve a lot of lives together, including active and retirees, as well as their dependents in our Mercer Marketplace as part of exchange. This equity investment enhances that relationship. It strengthens our proprietary solution. And it allows us to more closely collaborate and align on employer and consumer development needs. And those were the primary reasons why we actually went in and did the equity investment. It solidifies the partnership, and in essence, allows us to look at things more strategically together, as the exchange business continues to evolve and grow.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, this is for Mike, and it relates to FX and other good stuff like that. So is it fair to say that the pension impacts, both the costs and mitigation efforts, are still expected to completely offset one another for the year and that the FX impact is now up to $0.30 a share from what you had indicated, $0.15 coming out of the fourth quarter?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike, you want to take that?","J. Michael Bischoff","Okay, thank you. Larry, and I'm glad you asked for clarity. When we look at the total headwinds, pension, the lower interest rates essentially impacting our pension expenses on a year-over-year basis and foreign exchange, it comes to roughly $240 million to $250 million pretax dollars or roughly $0.30 a share. And it basically is roughly equal between the 2 macro headwinds. So about $0.15 of foreign exchange, about $0.15 of, call it, the impact of lower interest rates. That's very consistent with what we had said on the fourth quarter earnings call. The numbers just changed a bit, meaning a few million. But the total aggregate amount was still in that $240 million, $250 million category. So to be very clear, the foreign exchange impact is $125 million for the year, and we felt almost about $50 million of that in the first quarter.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just on Guy Carpenter, I saw that there was a negative 2 point impact from M&A. I'm just curious what that was?","J. Michael Bischoff","Larry, that's just the category -- this is Mike. That's just the category, where we say transfers the businesses between different of our operating units and others. So that's really what it was. We wanted to be very clear when we showed just the underlying growth. It's true business growth to the investment community, and so that was really in the other category.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to talk a little about FX. And obviously 1\/1 is a big day for you guys. You -- and currency is currency is much stronger on 1\/1. When you think about the new year 2016, is there much of an FX impact expected, I mean, I guess, particularly from Guy Carpenter or whatnot?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, why didn't you tell us, Josh?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Where interest rates are right now?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, I think FX moves in a lot of different factors other than interest rates, and there's many variables. And it tends to move in cycles. I mean, we've looked at the movement of the dollar all the way since Bretton Woods. And the reality over that length of time, where it's sort of close to the median level of where the dollar has been, it feels a lot stronger, just because it was weaker over the last period of time. But actually, over a longer period of time, it's about at the median. And it's really the volatility rather than the -- rather than whether the dollar is strengthening. And we were -- I think the whole world was taken by surprise in the period from, say, late October, early November all the way through to, say, the end of January. And so we're not anticipating that, but ultimately, we're working on a series of mitigating actions to try to make sure that both a -- that we're as prepared as we can be in a situation of either a strengthening dollar or interest rates to where that could create an impact on 2016.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, yes. I'm just talking about as through January 1 though. Given -- when you guys -- or on the last conference call, you had, I would imagine, a good sense of where your FX would be by the end of year, because a disproportionate amount of the revenue for the quarter was already earned through by the time you held the conference call.","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I mean, if you -- well, if you look at our quarters in general, Guy Carpenter is a little bit more weighted toward January than the other operating companies. Europe is a little bit more weighted toward January within Marsh. But Marsh actually, as the biggest opco, is pretty well balanced between the first, second and fourth quarter, and the third quarter is the shortest quarter. So I don't think you can read too much into the results as to whether we anticipate headwind January 1st or not from FX, because I think it's too early to say. I think the important thing to remember with FX is over a longer period of time for long-term shareholders, it has been a wash for Marsh & McLennan Companies, and that's over 10 years or 20 years. And so from that standpoint, this is a an issue that has arisen for this year. The last few years, we have worn $0.04 or $0.05 a year of headwind on it. This was just a spike year, in our view, but it's hard to tell where the macro world goes, and there's an awful lot of variables beyond interest rates that impacts the U.S. dollar.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's perfectly reasonable. And then, I can probably do the math myself and get it wrong. If I take all the puts and takes from FX, interest rates, pensions, the mitigation efforts, in terms of your long-term target of 13% EPS growth, where did the quarter shake out on a normalized basis?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, I would say, I'd go back to what we said last quarter, which was when we were looking at 2015, we were saying, if we looked at the year of 2015 on a constant-currency basis, we thought that we would deliver a result which was akin to our 13% long-term growth target. And that's just the impact of FX. And so from that standpoint, we expect to be high-single-digit EPS growth this year taking into consideration all of those factors, and we're working on a series of initiatives now that could potentially be utilized for next year in the event that there's headwinds that we have to deal with.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","2 quick questions just for you. First one, Mike, just a question on the pension. Any changes to the expected cash into the pension plan this year with the changes that you've made?","Daniel S. Glaser","Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","Good question. No, I think we're anticipating $190 million.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So it doesn't change at all. Okay, great. And then secondly, I'm just curious, I noticed you hired somebody, a pretty senior person, for tax in the first quarter. Any kind of updated thoughts? I know you chatted about it on last conference call, but any kind of updated thoughts on what you can do to get your tax rate down?","Daniel S. Glaser","Well, actually we've hired 2 senior people within the finance department recently. Both the head of tax and also a treasurer. But Mike, you want to talk a little bit about tax more broadly?","J. Michael Bischoff","Yes, I would say with regard to the new head of tax, it's really just long-term planning -- succession planning, and we're very fortunate to get a very, very capable individual to add to our team. When you look at tax, obviously, we were looking at a lot of issues across the entire globe. The thing that would help us the most, but we can't wish for, is a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. It's among the highest, if not the highest, in the developed world. The other issue with regard to the U.S. tax regulations is that it makes it very difficult to bring international cash back to the United States in a tax efficient manner. And so a lot of our efforts are predicated to that. When we look at what we've done over the last 4 or 5 years, the tax rate, either on an adjusted basis or on a GAAP basis, has averaged in a range of 29.5% and about 30%. And I think that's probably a good range to use for modeling purposes going forward.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just quickly, from an on operations perspective, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about opportunities. With cybersecurity, what you've done to beef up, is there anything that you still need to do from an investment perspective to get yourself in a position to really take advantage of what looks like it's going to be a big opportunity for you all?","Daniel S. Glaser","Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that, Brian, because it is a tremendous opportunity for the insurance community at large. And it's probably one of those things that -- it's a journey without end. I mean, in terms of what kind of innovations we can do to help better prepare our clients to not only beef up and be aware about risks associated with cyber, but also gain some level of risk transfer protection. So the insurance industry has done a great job in other areas over a long period of time of helping spread best practice and actually help clients avoid and mitigate risks before they even think about transferring it. And we think that Marsh & McLennan Companies has a tremendous role to play, in not only risk transfer, but also risk identification, risk avoidance, risk mitigation. But Peter, do you have something to add to that?","Peter Zaffino","We just -- yes, Dan, with RIMS being this week, we just launched some additional cyber capabilities. So we do agree that the high-profile breaches, the awareness at the board level, risk appetite in new industries like financial institutions, retail and healthcare, there is definitely an increased demand. And I think insurance companies are being very thoughtful in trying to offer capacity. We have continued to expand our modeling capabilities and just launched Marsh Cyber Monitor and Marsh Cyber View. I won't go into great detail, but it's a fresh look at cyber by continuously updating different threat indicators, and the analytics side is looking outside in, provides a very interesting lens into companies in risk scoring. And so we're able to do that in a real-time basis and have partnered with a company called Cyence. We announced it on Monday and believe that we will be arranging capacity for clients and have already rated 40,000-plus companies in the U.S. So I think it's an emerging and evolving part of our business, well, one that we think will have high growth over time.","Daniel S. Glaser","So operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","A couple of semi-philosophical questions here. First of all, when you think about the \"mitigation opportunities\" that you have, and you mentioned having more mitigation opportunities going forward, how does that tally with your general view of the value proposition you offer to employees who might expect to work until they retire?","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. So I'll take that broadly, and I enjoy your semi-philosophical question, Thomas. But I think you're on to something, because ultimately, all mitigation in a company has to be finding ways of reducing organic expense as a way to mitigate some headwinds that can be anticipated. And then you look at, well, what organic expenses do you have to try to mitigate. And there is a whole serious of things, but compensation and benefits is the largest expense category of all professional services firms. And then you have areas like technology, real estate, travel and entertainment, et cetera. And so you have to look at those things really broadly. When -- I think, as a good example of the way we approach our work with colleagues, I mean, we really do believe very sincerely that our colleague base is the heart and soul of the entire company. And actually, when we're making decision as an executive committee, we always have the thought of is this good for colleagues on a mid- and long-term basis in our minds when we're making those decisions. So I really don't think it has anything to do with people as they're getting closer to retirement and that sort of thing. I mean we're an industry that actually builds knowledge, and historical knowledge is incredibly important. And so from that perspective, I think that we have a lot of people who have had significant experiences in our businesses over long periods of time, who are still working for us, and we're happy they are.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And you're basically at a standard that's the same as the rest of the industry. So you're not likely to get producers taken away from you for any reason for that.","Daniel S. Glaser","I wouldn't have as a standard view us as being similar to any of the companies that you think our traditional competitors are. The fact of the matter is Marsh & McLennan Companies is a unique company and we do not have a single competitor in the world that competes with us globally across our operating companies. We have some competitors that come close to that. But in our view, we don't have the issue that you're citing about production or producers. We're not a producer culture. We are a content [indiscernible] and we employ people who enjoy working in a creative environment for smart people who are dedicated to working on clients, and it's self-selecting. So we attract those sorts of people, and we have not seen any abnormal blips in our voluntary turnover over the last several years.","Thomas Spikes Mitchell - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. Now I have a sort of different kind of question for Mike, which is, if I -- just -- if we just sort of close our eyes and we're sitting a year from now, now our sort of base is essentially $0.76 a share, that is we're now looking at foreign exchange neutral as if there were no change from March 31, '15, to March 31, '16. So in that case, it's perfectly reasonable for you to make the comparisons to do against first quarter '14. I'm not talking about that. But now that we're looking at that, my basic question is, are the things that come in either on an annual basis or even a quarterly basis from this termination of this plan that would essentially benefit either quarterly or annual earnings going forward, perhaps not by as much as the one-time adjustment, but would be an ongoing or recurring savings for the company.","J. Michael Bischoff","Okay. So thanks, Thomas. Thank you, Thomas. And Mike?","J. Michael Bischoff","The answer is that we've been dealing with these 2 macro headwinds, depending on how you count, for 4 or 7 years. In aggregate, the interest rates -- lower interest rates have cost us probably $0.55 on our earnings, and the foreign exchange over the last 4 years has cost us $0.30, enormous amounts. Yet every year, we continue to have growth despite the headwinds. And I think that's what we're looking at in '16 and beyond.","Daniel S. Glaser","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, Thomas. And I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. Specifically, and having Peter and I just returning from RIMS, I'd like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have a great day."],"14266":["Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.","For a more details discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release.","I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Elaine, and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman.","Also, with us this morning is, Dan Farrell, Head of Investor Relations. Dan has had had two successful years leading the IR team and will soon be transitioning to a new role. We\u2019re pleased that Sarah DeWitt has recently joined us and will take over as Head of IR. On behalf of the executive committee, I want to thank Dan for his contributions.","Our fourth quarter represented an outstanding finish to the year. Our overall revenue growth in the quarter was strong with 5% underlying growth and all of our business contributing. Marsh grew 6% in the quarter on an underlying basis, the strongest quarter of underlying growth since the second quarter of 2012. Guy Carpenter also finished strong posting 5% underlying revenue growth. The eighth consecutive quarter of 4% or better underlying growth. These results combine to lift our underlying growth in RIS to 6% for the quarter, the third consecutive quarter of underlying growth of 5% or more in RIS.","Our Consulting segment grew 3% on an underlying basis in the quarter, due to a solid finish to the year in Oliver Wyman, an improvement in DB Consulting in Mercer. The fourth quarter as expected saw a strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 180 basis points and adjusted operating income growth of 15%, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard.","For the full-year, we generated 7% overall revenue growth with 4% underlying growth. By segment, we saw underlying growth of 5% in RIS, the best full-year growth we have seen since 2012 and 3% underlying growth in consulting. We demonstrated topline strength across our businesses. Marsh delivered 4% underlying growth for the year, the best result since 2014. Guy Carpenter had a terrific year with 7% underlying growth, the strongest result since 2009.","Mercer achieved 3% underlying growth, despite a 4% decline in the DBA business and Oliver Wyman grew 5% for the year overcoming headwinds from declining bank regulatory work. Our adjusted NOI grew 8% with overall margin expansion of 30 basis points for the year, marking the eleventh consecutive year we have reported margin expansion.","Adjusted EPS grew 11% for the year, another year of double-digit growth that came on top of 15% growth in 2017. Since 2009, our adjusted EPS growth has averaged 13%. We balanced delivering today with positioning for tomorrow, and 2018 was a great example of strong overall execution.","In addition to our strong 2018 financial performance, we made several meaningful decisions to position us for continued long-term growth. Outside of JLT, which we will discuss shortly, we deployed 1.1 billion of capital across 23 transactions representing another year of significant reinvestment in building our business through acquisitions.","I\u2019d like to highlight some of the transactions from the past year. In Mercer, we closed the acquisitions of Pavilion and Summit in the fourth quarter. These transactions add to our capabilities and scale in investments. Earlier in the year, we announced Marsh\u2019s acquisition of Wortham combining one of the largest and best independent brokerage firms in the U.S. with our already strong position in Texas.","MMA also had an active year adding seven new firms in 2018. And just last week, we announced the acquisition of Bouchard Insurance. Bouchard, based in Florida has 42 million in revenue and roughly 260 employees. As I said last quarter, we will continue to invest in Marsh & McLennan Agency, one of the finest insurance brokerage firms operating in the middle market in the U.S.","In addition to continuing to execute our M&A strategy, we made meaningful progress in planting seeds in digital data and analytics. Each of our businesses continues to invest in building our capabilities. I won\u2019t go through all the initiatives, but will highlight a few examples of our progress.","In Marsh, we launched Bluestream, a digital broking platform initially focused on affinity and sharing economy businesses. Bluestream has the potential to be leveraged more broadly to seamlessly match risk and capital in the small commercial and consumer segment. It also complements other digital and small commercial strategies, including Dovetail, ICAT, Torrent, and the rebranding of our managing general underwriter as Victor.","Guy Carpenter launched GC Genesis, a proprietary advisory offering on insurtech. The new service is identifying insurtech companies that will offer our clients innovative capabilities and enhance their operations and technology strategies. At Mercer, we announced this strategic alliance with Morningstar, which gives clients digital subscription access to Mercer\u2019s proprietary investment manager research opening up a new distribution outlet for Mercer.","And in Oliver Wyman, we continue to build our capabilities in digital consulting and business development through our DTA, digital technology and analytics practice, including Oliver Wyman labs. We have a deep bench of talent throughout our firm and take succession planning seriously.","We recently announced that Martine Ferland will become President and CEO of Mercer as of March 1 and will join the MMC Executive Committee. Martine has a wealth of experience across Mercers businesses and is a proven global leader. Julio has done a great job at Mercer, successfully leading the business since 2012.","Over that time, Mercer has nearly doubled adjusted operating income and expanded assets under delegated management by five-fold. I am pleased the company will continue to benefit from Julio\u2019s advice and council as the Vice Chairman of MMC. In recent months, Julio and Martine have continued reshaping Mercer\u2019s operating model and in the fourth quarter we took to restructuring actions with associated charges totaling 51 million.","We simplified Mercers organization by consolidating the three geographic regions into two; U.S. Canada and International. This aligns more closely with the regional structures in place across other businesses of Marsh & McLennan. The actions resulted in structural changes in Mercer that streamline its operating model creating more efficiency and enabling better execution.","Now, let\u2019s take a moment to update you on the progress we have made on JLT. As we have said from the beginning, the is a combination of strength and strength and the primary focus is growth. Growth in talent, capabilities, revenue, and earnings. We set our approach to integration would be from the perspective of best of both and we have been true to this ideal.","We have made important announcements about the leadership teams of Marsh, Mercer, and Guy Carpenter after closing. And it is important to note that we will have meaningful representation of senior JLT colleagues at the executive committee level. Our leadership team recently visited JLT\u2019s major locations around the world, including staffs in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, many cities in the U.S. and of course London.","Through townhall\u2019s and other interactions, we have had the opportunity to engage with colleagues representing 80% of JLT\u2019s global revenue base. The real upside for value creation is combining two successful organizations into an even more innovative and talented professional services firm. I am encouraged by our early organizational decisions in the level of engagement and commitment we are seeing throughout Marsh & McLennan and JLT.","In terms of closing, we are still in the regulatory approval process. At this time, we continue to expect closing in the spring of 2019. Our strong performance in 2018 positions us well for the future. Our purpose is to make it different in the moments that matter and create value for our clients, our colleagues, our shareholders and the broader community.","As we look to 2019 and beyond, our future is bright. Our revenue base continues to shift towards faster growing areas. We expect to see benefits from our investments in digital and technology and we are confident in our ability to complete and successfully integrate JLT.","Without any impact from JLT, in 2019, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Additionally, in 2019, we expect to reduce our share count and deliver double-digit increase in our dividend.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our fourth quarter performance represented an outstanding finish to 2018. We delivered 5% underlying revenue growth highlighted by 6% growth in RIS and 3% in consulting. Consolidated revenue of 3.7 billion was up 1% or 4%, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard ASC 606. Operating income in the quarter was 621 million, while adjusted operating income increased 7% to 731 million.","Excluding the impact of the new revenue standards, adjusted operating income increased 15%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 180 basis points, excluding the impact of the new revenue standard with significant expansion in both segments. Adjusted EPS increased 4% to $1.09, excluding an $0.08 per share reduction from adopting the new revenue standard, adjusted EPS grew 11% in the quarter.","For the year, consolidated revenue increased 7% to 15 billion, driven by strong underlying growth of 4% and a meaningful contribution from acquisition. Adjusted operating income increased 8% to 2.9 billion, while the adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 19.7%. GAAP EPS increased 13% for the year, while our adjusted EPS increased 11% to $4.35.","Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, fourth quarter revenue was 1.9 billion, a decrease of 2%. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue growth was 6%. Adjusted operating income for the quarter decreased 1% to 418 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income grew 16%, the adjusted operating margin rose 200 basis points.","For the year, revenue was 8.2 billion, an increase of 8% with strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income for the year was up 11%, and our adjusted operating margin increased to 90 basis points to 23.9%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 5% to 1.8 billion, increasing 66% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong new business and retention.","The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of the strong growth delivering 7% underlying revenue growth in the quarter. International was up 5% with Asia-Pacific and Latin America up 8% and EMEA up 3%. For the year, revenue at Marsh was 6.9 billion with 4% underlying growth. In the quarter, Marsh incurred an additional 12 million of restructuring charges bringing the total to 99 million for the year.","Guy Carpenter's revenue was 102 million in the quarter with underlying growth of 5%, a strong finish to another outstanding year for Guy Carpenter. For the year, revenue was 1.3 billion, with a 7% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue increased 4% to 1.8 billion or 3% excluding the impact of the new revenue standard. ","Underlying revenue growth was 3%. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to 359 million. Excluding the impact of the new revenue standard, adjusted operating income increased 9%, the adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis point. For the year, revenue was 6.8 billion, an increase of 5% with underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income was up 3%, and the adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points to 17.2%. ","Mercer's revenue increased 3% in the quarter to 1.2 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Wealth was down 1% on an underlying basis with Investment Management & Related Services up 1%, and Defined Benefit Consulting & Administration down 2%. ","Our revenue in investment management was affected by the market volatility in the fourth quarter. Despite the volatility, our overall assets under delegated management ended the year at 241 billion, up 6% from year-end 2017, reflecting continued strong asset inflows.","Health increased 4% on an underlying basis in the quarter, driven by solid growth in most geographies. And Career grew 5% with continued strong growth in our strategic consulting and survey businesses. For the year, revenue at Mercer was 4.7 billion with 3% underlying growth.","As Dan noted, Mercer's fourth quarter results included a restructuring charge of 51 million, which we have excluded from our adjusted results. We expect additional restructuring charges under this program of approximately 20 million to 30 million in the first half of 2019. ","Oliver Wyman's revenue was 577 million in the quarter with an underlying increase of 7%. This result was due to strong growth in North America across all business sectors. For the year, revenue was 2 billion with 5% underlying growth. We continue to make good progress as we work towards closing the JLT transaction.","As Dan mentioned, we expect to close in the spring and we\u2019d then be in a position to update our guidance. As part of the planned financing for the acquisition, earlier this month, we issued 5 billion of senior notes across six tranches of various maturities. In the fourth quarter, we entered into contract to hedge a portion of the risk associated with changes in interest rate. ","As a result, we recorded a charge of 116 million, related to the change in fair value of these hedges, which were settled as part of our January issuance. With the issuance of these notes, we have completed a substantial portion of the financing required for the JLT acquisition, and currently plan to enter the market later this quarter for the remainder. We began incurring interest expense on this new debt as of January 15 and will treat this expense as a noteworthy item, net of interest income earned until the closing of the transaction.","As we mentioned last quarter, in order to protect us from exchange rate volatility between announcement and closing, we entered into a deal contingent foreign exchange hedging contract. As a result of entering into this contract, we reported a non-cash charge of 225 million, reflecting the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument at the end of the quarter. The amount of this item will change as we progress towards closing, due to exchange rate volatility.","Despite the volatility we will see from fair value accounting under GAAP, the cost of this hedge was contemplated in our estimate of overall transaction-related expenses. We also incurred 27 million of interest expense in the quarter, representing the amortization of fees related to our bridge facility. This 27 million is included in interest expense in our GAAP income statement.","All of these costs associated with the JLT acquisition have been treated as noteworthy item. As we typically do on our fourth quarter call, I will give you a brief update on our global retirement plan. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were 112 million in 2018, down from 314 million in 2017. We expect cash contributions in 2019 will be roughly in-line with the level in 2018.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $42 million settlement charge, resulting from distribution elections made by participants in our U.K. plan. This expense, which is similar to a charge in the fourth quarter of last year is reflected as a noteworthy item. Excluding this charge, our other net benefit credit was 63 million in the quarter. For 2019, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be essentially the same as in 2018, excluding the settlement charge. ","Turning to investment income, on a GAAP basis, investment income was 12 million in the fourth quarter and a 12 million loss for the full-year 2018. As we have seen throughout 2018, our GAAP investment income includes mark-to-market gains on certain equity investments as required by recent accounting changes. Because we do not view the volatility caused by these adjustments as reflective of our underlying performance, we have excluded them from our adjusted results and shown them as noteworthy items.","On an adjusted basis, we have 4 million of investment income in the quarter and 18 million for the full-year 2018. For 2019, we expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was a slight headwind to EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current level. We expect FX to be a modest headwind to adjusted EPS for 2019, excluding any impact from JLT.","We expect the majority of this impact in the first quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23.6%, compared with 23.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was approximately 27%. For the full-year 2018, our adjusted tax rate was 24.3%. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%.","When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding any impact from JLT. In 2018, we repurchased 8.2 million shares for 675 million. ","As part of the capital planning related to the JLT transaction it is unlikely we will repurchase any stock ahead of the close of the acquisition. However, in 2019, we anticipate repurchasing enough stock to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year. Total debt at the end of 2018 was 5.8 billion, compared with 5.5 billion at the end of 2017. Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 when 300 million of senior notes will mature.","Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.1 billion. Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled 591 million and included 213 million for dividend and 378 million for acquisition. For the full-year 2018, uses of cash totaled 2.6 billion and included 675 million for share repurchases, 807 million for dividends, and 1.1 billion for acquisitions.","In 2018, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by 4.9 million shares of 1%, and increased our dividends per share by 10%. Before I wrap up, I want to spend a minute on our financial disclosures. Last quarter, we were asked, if we were considering changing how we report adjusted earnings per share, specifically the treatment of deal amortization.","After carefully considering our current disclosures, we have decided that we will not change how we report adjusted earnings per share. We have always included transaction amortization in our earnings and have consistently challenged ourselves to overcome that cost through value creation in our acquisition. JLT doesn't change our perspective. That said, the integration of JLT will likely involve more adjustments to our numbers over the next two or three years that we have seen historically. ","So, we have decided to include a full cash flow statement with our press release to provide additional information to the investment community as early as possible. As you see in the statement of cash flows, which appears on Page 19 of our press release schedules, we had significant growth in operating cash flow in 2018. This is reflective of our strong operating performance and a reduction in pension contributions among other factors, and changes despite the restructuring charges at Marsh and Mercer during the year.","We are also planning to change our calculation of adjusted operating margin to exclude transaction amortization so investors can get a better sense of core margin performance. We envision making this change starting with our first quarter reporting.","In summary, we are proud of what we have accomplished in 2018. 7% revenue growth, 4% underlying revenue growth, 8% adjusted operating income growth, 30 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, and 11% adjusted EPS growth, all while enhancing our position for long-term growth with the acquisition of JLT.","With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, Mark. And operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First, I would like to thank Dan Farrell for all the help and also want the best wishes for Sarah going forward. My first question is on the organic growth. If you look at the last three years 2016, 2017 organic growth overall 3%, and now step up in 2018 to 4%, I\u2019m wondering if you can go through your major segment to see if that trend is going to accelerate going forward?","Dan Glaser","No, it\u2019s a good question Kai, and obviously a lot of our focus in the company is driving organic growth. In addition to overall revenue growth, we were quite pleased with the 7% growth for the overall company this year and obviously 4% underlying is an improvement of the last couple of years. I will remind you in 2015 we were 4% and in 2014 we were 5% as an overall company. So, there\u2019s no overall boundary in terms of what kind of performance that we can get. Obviously, RIS was strong this year, Consulting was a bit choppier. But when we look forward, we think generally the trend for the last 9 years or 10 years we\u2019ve been bounded in that 3% to 5% organic growth area. So, unless we actually perform above 5% for a period of time, we're probably going to stay and say that 3% to 5% is the most likely outcome and we\u2019re more likely at this stage to be above that and below that, but 3 to 5 is probably where we are in 2019.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then on the margin front, so if you grow like 4% last year, margin expanded 30 basis points, part of that because tough comp comparing with 2017, I\u2019m wondering if you grow the same pace as last year, this year, organically will the pace of margin expansion be faster?","Dan Glaser","We would hope so. I mean, at the end, our view is that our margins this year in \u2013 we were quite satisfied with RIS, obviously consulting has been a bit choppier the last couple of years, last year or in 2017 rather was 10 bips of improvement in Consulting and this year actually being negative that\u2019s not our regular way of operating, so we would expect that to turn around and result in better margin performance, but I would remind everybody that in this company we focus more on revenue growth and earnings growth than our margin expansions.","I mean margins will expand as a natural way of us running the business where we almost always grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses, but when we're sitting around the conference table, we're not talking about margin expansion. We are talking about revenue growth and net operating income growth as that is what the focus of the company is.","Kai Pan","Okay. Thank you so much.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Yes, thanks good morning. So, Dan I didn\u2019t hear you call on expectation for double-digit EPS growth and I appreciate the JLT creates some challenging comparisons there, but if we just look at legacy Marsh, is it fair to expect something close to 10% plus operating earnings growth on just the legacy Marsh piece?","Dan Glaser","When I think about legacy and when you say Marsh, I guess you mean Marsh & McLennan?","Ryan Tunis","Yes, sorry.","Dan Glaser","So, overall when I think about the company, we have delivered despite a great deal of skepticism over many years, a 13% CAGR since 2009 on adjusted EPS growth with not much of a gap between our GAAP results and our reported adjusted results. So, this is real delivery. And obviously the focus on that is revenue growth and net operating income growth. ","With a bit of capital management, which has been relatively slight within Marsh & McLennan and the end result of that has been double-digit performance, but that \u2013 our level of double-digit performance in our view because our costs are largely controllable and visible, as long as we grow well on an underlying basis, we believe we will have strong performance on adjusted EPS.","Now, obviously over the next couple of years, we have the integration of JLT. So, it\u2019s going to be a little messier and there will be more of a gap between our reported results and our GAAP results and that\u2019s one of the reasons as Mark was saying, they were going to show you what\u2019s happening with cash flow as a way to really understand the value being created in the business over time.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. And then my follow-up just on Oliver Wyman better than expected this quarter, wondering if that\u2019s just timing related and also, some perspective on what you think the drivers of that are going to be next year, I know that tends to be somewhat of an economically sensitive business? Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Sure. I\u2019ll hand off to Scott in a second. I mean, if I look over the last five years, Oliver Wyman is our fastest growing operating company although with more volatility and that\u2019s just part of having a business within the overall business that doesn\u2019t have much recurring revenue, and so Oliver Wyman hit the $2 billion mark for the first time in its history, and so we're very pleased with the overall top line performance and putting that in perspective that\u2019s almost $2 billion of new business that gets created in the given year and so it shows the strength of the organization, but we all have to pay around this table, as well as our shareholders with the notion that that result because of its non-recurring nature it has more volatility. And as you say, it\u2019s more exposed or vulnerable to business confidence and general economic trends, but Scott, do you want to dig in a little deeper?","Scott McDonald","Yes. Brian let me reinforce a few of the things Dan said. I mean because of the nature of the business there is little guarantee of recurring revenue, and our visibility on backlog is typically somewhere between four weeks and three months depending on market conditions and the type of work we\u2019re selling. And given that we do see volatility quarter-to-quarter and we can either overshoot or undershoot our best estimates of where we're going to be in the next quarter. And as Dan highlighted for the company this is largely a revenue rather than an NOI issue because our comp model is very tightly aligned with revenue.","Now in the second half of 2018, and particularly in the fourth quarter, we did see much stronger demand than we\u2019ve been expecting across the entire portfolio and that led to the strong performance you\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s good news for the business and it does suggest to us that despite the daily forecast of gloom and doom for the global economy individual businesses are still pursuing initiatives that require consulting support. So, my view hasn't changed that we still think this business should generate mid-to-high single-digit growth over time. There\u2019s still market share for us to take and I think we\u2019re in good shape for 2019.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Scott. Thanks Ryan. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We now move to Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski","Hi, good morning. As a follow-up to Ryan's question about adjusted EPS growth ex-JLT, if I\u2019m understanding correctly it sounds like directionally, you're backing off the previous 13% EPS growth goal and if that\u2019s correct, I was just kind of wondering what\u2019s changed?","Dan Glaser","I don't know where you got that because it\u2019s not accurate. The reality is, we have never had guidance around adjusted EPS growth. Our guidance that came out of our last Investor Day was that we will grow our dividend double-digit each year and we would reduce our share count each year and we also said that our view was over long stretches of time, not particularly every year, and not particularly every quarter that we will deliver a long-term CAGR around 13% in our view. Now, we have had ups and downs to that, obviously we\u2019ve had stronger adjusted EPS performance in the early stages when we're having dramatic margin expansion, you know 8 and 7 years ago, but we have still had double-digit adjusted EPS growth and last year was particularly strong for a variety of different reasons. And so, our view remains that over a long stretch of time, we believe that adjusted EPS growth of around 13% is achievable.","Now, it requires having better growth than 3% underlying. Now whether that, I mean obviously it becomes easier at 5 and 6 than it is at 4, but we absolutely believe that there is strong opportunity in the company to continue to deliver very good adjusted EPS growth. And I mean, it\u2019s just \u2013 just to take a moment and talk a little bit about the component parts because obviously revenue growth, margin expansion, capital management delivers adjusted EPS growth. And when your margins are low, then you can have pretty dramatic margin expansion, which makes double-digit adjusted EPS growth more of a layout. Now that we have very strong margins, it becomes more difficult and it means that the top line becomes more important. So, if I look back 6, 7, 8 years ago it was a margin expansion story. Now, it becomes a topline achievement required in order to deliver the adjusted EPS growth that we\u2019ve delivered in the past.","Mike Zaremski","Okay understood. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Do you have a follow-up?","Mike Zaremski","Yes. One follow-up. Mark did you give tax rate guidance for 2019? I believe that some of your peers are waiting for the Treasury to issue a bunch of guidance which they issued potentially back this past December? Thanks.","Mark McGivney","Yes. I said in my script, the outlook for this year, 2019, is between 25% and 26%, excluding discrete items and also without regard to any impact from JLT.","Mike Zaremski","Okay, so no major changes year-over-year. Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We now move to Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Mark, can you quantify whether or I guess discuss whether there is any impact on the individual segment margins from foreign exchange swings in the quarter?","Mark McGivney","Overall, as I said, FX was a modest headwind in the quarter, but it was modest. And so, the level of significance to margins in earnings by segment was relatively insignificant, which is why we didn\u2019t call it out.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Broadly speaking, I think it\u2019s more of a question for Dan. Given the tight employment markets. Do you need more organic growth now to translate into natural margin expansion that would have been the case 2, 3, 4 years ago?","Dan Glaser","Not quite sure I understand your question Meyer. Do you want to give it another go?","Meyer Shields","Sure. I\u2019m basically asking whether there is a higher natural upward drift in compensation expenses now than in past years just because of the domestic employment situation?","Dan Glaser","We like a lot of others have watched whether wage inflation appears. You will see in our disclosures that our compensation line from a fixed basis, our comp and ben line, is mildly lower as a percentage of revenue than it was last year. And so, it certainly is not manifesting. One of the benefits that we have is that our bonus arrangements are driven off of earnings, and so I\u2019m pleased to say that 2018 will be the tenth consecutive year of the overall Marsh & McLennan Companies\u2019 bonus pool has increased. And so that gives us some flexibility to manage fixed cost because of the increases in our variable compensation.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We now move to Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question kind of goes back to your organic growth outlook, the 3% to 5% range for this coming year. Dan, you know we\u2019ve had some folks kind of speculating whether or not we\u2019re going to go into a recession either late this year, maybe that\u2019s something that\u2019s more 2020, I guess, just interested in a broader view, if we do go into recession on your brokerage business very economically sensitive, how do you see that playing out? And then, could you remind us if we, you know as we\u2019ve gone into past recessions, is there a lag like how should we think about the potential for a recession to flow through into the revenue within your brokerage business?","Dan Glaser","I mean, obviously expansions and recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle, and it\u2019s interesting how basically the watch has begun for when will the next recession occur. We don't have a view about that. What we would say you, you know in the worst financial crisis in generations, RIS was down 1% in 2009, consulting was down around 6%, and then bounced back strongly the following year in 2010. I would say from an overall standpoint; our recurring revenue businesses are more resilient and more insulated from immediate economic impacts, and so you\u2019d have to have deep and long recession to have a significant impact.","Oliver Wyman tends to be a little bit of our canary in the coal mine because usually in recessions companies start reducing discretionary expenses or projects related to the future because they humper down to deal with the present. And right now, as you heard from Scott, we\u2019re not seeing it. That doesn't mean that there won't be some sort of recession sometime in either the 2020, 2021, 2022, I was saying that on when I was interviewed in Davos. But ultimately, the impact on our business relative to other companies in the S&P 500 is far milder because of the level of requirement around many of our businesses and the advice that we give.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question, I was hoping if we can get a little bit of an update on Marsh & McLennan Agency, MMA. So, strong growth within the U.S. and Canada in the quarter, could you comment or just give us a little sense, usually MMA growth is faster than the rest of Marsh, is that still the case and can you just provide an update on how that business has been trending and where the revenue sits today?","Dan Glaser","I\u2019m thrilled with the question because Mark and I are here running corporate and we've got these guys around the table who are running big businesses and have delivered a fantastic result for the year, but John you want to talk a little bit about MMA?","John Doyle","Sure. Thanks for putting me to work, Elyse. So, MMA had a terrific year again. They continue to execute well, strong underlying growth performing quite well, what I\u2019m particularly encouraged about, you know that Dave and his team are operating a better together campaign. So, they're working and leaning on each other within the agency, better than they ever have and leaning in to Marsh as well, grabbing resource when it can, helping Marsh in other parts of the world develop its middle-market value proposition and its sales strategies in other parts of the world. ","You know what I would say their year in 2018 was, it was very consistent between P&C and benefits and really by region. So, there's a lot to feel good about, and I would remind you, as big as the business has become, we have a relatively modest market share as well. So, if we see plenty of opportunity for growth in the future.","Dan Glaser","As we mentioned before as well, just adding to John's comments. We have good acquisition pipeline within the agency and despite the significant commitment with regard to JLT, we have provided for continuing funding for acquisitions within Marsh & McLennan Agency.","John Doyle","I could make one other comment too Dan because I think Elyse asked about the comparisons to the rest of the U.S. business. Marsh U.S. had a very strong year, this year as well. So, certainly, ordinarily MMA's organic growth has outpaced Marsh U.S., but Marsh U.S. had a terrific year, this year.","Dan Glaser","Thank you. Next question please. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Larry Greenberg of Janney Montgomery Scott has our next question. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Thank you, and good morning. Just looking at within Marsh and the international segment, it appears that organic was trending up over the course of the year, and certainly the fourth quarter was pretty impressive, are there any underlying trends to decipher there or is that just the episodic nature of the markets?","Dan Glaser","John.","John Doyle","Sure. What I would say is, on the international side, we had consistent strong performance in Latin America, Asia, Continental Europe, so really broadly speaking had terrific results internationally. As I pointed out on prior calls, during the course of 2018, we\u2019re facing some headwinds in the Middle East and also in the UK, both rebounded a bit in the fourth quarter, a bit stronger performance in the Middle East and in Africa in the fourth quarter and we made some leadership changes there as we talked about in the past. Terrific team, making a difference and I expect good solid growth in the Middle East during 2019.","The UK leadership changes have also taken hold and I\u2019m seeing some good positive signs. Having said that, there are obviously some macro headwinds in the UK. So, I don't expect the UK to be leading the overall growth in Marsh in 2019, but I do on the other hand and think we're performing much better than we did about a year ago.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks. And then just maybe some comments on your view of commercial lines market conditions, we haven't had many underwriters report to date, but there seems to be, maybe a slight bit of optimism in the year of maybe some acceleration in pricing in some areas of the marketplace, just curious of your view of where things stand?","John Doyle","Okay. I\u2019ll give you some data rather than optimism or pessimism maybe. Pricing was up nearly 2% in the fourth quarter, versus 1.4% in the third quarter. The U.S. and UK, which as you know is a big part of our business overall. Pricing was slightly up on average. Australia remains the outlier market, where prices are relatively firm on average, 10-plus percent increases across most product lines. Most other countries, pricing is right around the 1% on the increase range.","Product view of casualty was down slightly, primarily due to work comp in the U.S., and I would say most other casualty lines are up couple of points on average, but work comp brings that average down. Property prices didn\u2019t move much in the fourth quarter, compared to earlier in 2018. They were up about 3.5% in the quarter. In financial lines, D&O pricing, the E&O pricing, prices were up over 4%, which was about 100 basis point increase from what we saw in the third quarter. ","I would say, before I ask maybe Peter to jump in here, the market was a bit choppier at the end of the year, there\u2019s no questions. So, I think the range of outcomes was a bit wider than what we had seen earlier in the year, although the average didn\u2019t more all that much, and capital levels do remain strong. So, I certainly wouldn't project. I would anticipate continued \u2013 relatively stable market on average.","Dan Glaser","Peter?","Peter Hearn","Thank you. Larry, I would say that overall, if I look at the 1\/1 renewals of the reinsurance market, they were muted and it really was a function of clients who experienced loss activity, particularly in the recessional and the property markets more than any other market that we saw. Casualty was \u2013 pricing was relatively stable. In the United States, we saw some downturn in pricing in the European renewals, but overall, I\u2019d say pricing was muted. We didn't see any significant increases.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Next question please. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Jay Cohen of Bank of America has our next question. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. I just want to echo the thoughts on Dan Farrell. He's done a great job as IR person and good luck of course to the next team coming in. So, question on the U.S. and Canada, the organic growth there, obviously strong. If you just look at GDP growth, maybe a little bit of tailwind from pricing, but not much, you\u2019d guess that you guys are gaining share in the U.S. and Canada. And I\u2019m wondering, one if that\u2019s the case? And secondly, if that is the case where is that share gain? Where is it? What products or what parts of the business?","Dan Glaser","First of all \u2013 yes, I will hand of to John in a second, but we tend not to talk about market shares although some other do because it\u2019s not audited, there is not third party that calculates this in the U.S. and when I look at some marketing materials here and there, it seems like everybody has got a very high share, and so ultimately we\u2019re out there account by account in different segments of the market. I think the variety of our businesses is also very helpful because we're highly specialized, highly segmented, but John do you want to give some color into individual pockets of particular strength in the U.S.\/Canada?","John Doyle","Sure. Jay, I talked about MMA before, so maybe I'll just focus on Marsh U.S. They had a terrific quarter, as I said, very strong new business in the year. Retention also picked up during the course of the year, which is a year-on-year phenomenon so that certainly helps with the roll over into what we saw on 2018. We had good specialties performance across the board, maybe to highlight a few areas that had particularly strong growth. Our private equity group, which advices portfolio companies and PE firms had terrific growth in the year. Transaction risk, given the M&A market, an increasing penetration into adding insurance as a means to help get deals closed at very strong growth.","Cyber, of course, continues to grow and now is becoming a meaningful part of our portfolio. Marsh Risk Consulting also had a very strong year in the U.S. and rest of world by the way, but had terrific growth advising clients on how to really bend their risk curve over time. Our underwriting operations, Victor, Torrent and ICAT, also had terrific years this year. So, all of that contributed to a really \u2013 really since we've been reporting this way, the best year on record for Marsh in the U.S.","You mentioned Canada briefly. And Chris Lay, who had moved into Canada a couple of years ago and now is leading our UK operations really set the stage nicely and Sarah Robson stepped in early in 2018 to take over that operation. They had their best quarter and best year of growth in a long-long time in Canada. There's obviously a mature market there. So, some of the products in Canada that grew are the same that saw good outcomes in the United States, but yes it was a really strong performance across really most businesses in the United States.","Dan Glaser","Anything else, Jay?","Jay Cohen","No, that\u2019s it, John. Very helpful answer as usual. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thank you. First Mark, thanks for providing the cash flow statement, it\u2019s really helpful. And a quick question on it. If I take a look at your free cash flow that you generated for the year, obviously a really, really strong part of it, a big part of it the pension drop. But even ex the pension, it looks like $350 million increase in free cash flow, is there anything unusual kind of happening this year on the free cash flow working capital or could we expect to ex-JLT to continue to see that kind of strength in free cash flow generation?","Mark McGivney","Actually, if you look down the column in 2018 there is relative stability in a lot of the balance sheet items that could swing around. So, it was pretty straightforward and pretty strong and as simple as strong operating earnings growth and the 200 or so million dollars reduction in pension contribution. Those were the big drivers. If you look back to 2017, there was a lot geography noise with some of the accounting around tax reform. The 2018 was pretty clean and as Dan said, JLT is going to involve some noise over the next two or three years, but excluding that, our outlook would be that it's for a strong earnings growth and we would expect strong cash flow growth as well.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then my second question, just going to Mercer. You announced additional restructuring charge going on here, may be little behind the restructuring, is that simply because of the organic growth at Mercer just trying to keep margins stable or is that margin accretive, kind of what\u2019s the thought process behind that?","Dan Glaser","I\u2019ll start by just saying, we don't \u2013 we\u2019re not doing restructurings, even mild restructurings with margins in mind. We do restructurings based upon how we look as a go forward business, but Julio?","Julio Portalatin","Thank you, Brian. As Dan mentioned, our ability to be able to continue to look at our business day-in and day-out and maximize opportunities, to invest where it\u2019s necessary to do so to accelerate growth, comparable growth, and also to disinvest in some of the areas of our business as well is pretty much what we\u2019re trying to do at this point with this restructuring. The investments that we\u2019ve made in areas of data analytics, digital, middle market expansion, of course our very successful investment management business, our health benefit platform, and several acquisitions that we\u2019ve made or indeed experiencing accelerated growth.","As you know, we\u2019ve had some challenges with some portions of our business that we've discussed in past, but today the fast-changing landscape requires that we review in our position and take action when needed to accelerate some further investments and, as I said, disinvestments, which are prudent in our business. We\u2019ll continue to do that and our earnings obviously will be positively impacted by some of the actions that we\u2019re taking and it\u2019ll continue to give us some, let's say, tailwind as we go into 2019.","Brian Meredith","Got you. So, if I understand correctly, it's basically to be able to invest in other areas, this is kind of the \u2013 it will be offset with investment?","Julio Portalatin","I mean the restructured combines growth and investment with actions and improved efficiencies.","Brian Meredith","Okay.","Dan Glaser","So, there will be some tailwind as Julio said on the bottom line and on margins within consulting as a result, but it won't all drop.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Operator, next question please","Operator","David Styblo with Jefferies has our next question. Please go ahead.","David Styblo","Sure. Thanks for taking the questions Dan. I\u2019ll keep the executive team involved. My first one is, just on Guy Carpenter, the fourth quarter number is 5% that was pretty solid, especially in-light of last year's tough comp, and I think maybe at least half of that 7% growth a year ago was from storm activities. So curious to hear a little bit about the strength in the business. You guys had even talked about the fourth quarter being more tempered, so it\u2019s obviously been a really strong year and curious to hear a little bit more about the sustainability of the 7% growth that you guys have experienced for full-year?","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Peter?","Peter Hearn","Yes, thank you, David. I mean obviously it was a very good year. We\u2019re very pleased with it, and we expect some quarterly volatility in the growth rates in terms of the results of the phasing of the revenue that we now have, but we continue to build the business to grow irrespective of the macro environment. And I mean, if you look at our business, our new business growth over the past two years has been significant. We have strong disciplined pipelines that we continue to manage on a monthly basis, and it\u2019s bearing the fruit that we've made the investments in people and infrastructure to create strong pipelines and strong new business growth.","David Styblo","It\u2019s helpful thanks. And then maybe Dan coming back to you, the overall business obviously has some very strong momentum as you\u2019re exiting the year, Especially in RIS, you've had like a 5% organic growth, 5% organic growth, 6%, I know you would like to talk about the last four quarters. I guess as you stand here and you\u2019re going forward into 2019 how \u2013 and there are certain tailwinds that are coming, it seems like EMEA is starting to turn the corner after it was having some tough times, how sustainable is that performance, particularly in light of your earlier comments about how important it is to drive the top line more than margin expansion because margins have increased a lot over the last decade and then I will contribute as much? So, the bottom line now is, as the top line in organic growth. So, just thinking about the points of emphasis to making sure we have as much line of sight as possible in the top line. How do you view that sustainability of the organic growth trends that you\u2019ve seen particularly in the back half?","Dan Glaser","Well, the way I look at it is, all four of our businesses are run well. And have done things over a number your years to position us well for long-term growth and for improving profitability. Obviously, we exist in the world so matter of factors impact us just like they do to everybody else, but where there is growth in the world, I believe Marsh & McLennan will be on the ground with growth strategies and good execution to capture that growth. So, I don't think there has been a time in our history as a company where we are better positioned either strategically, financially, or operationally and so we're looking forward, not just to 2019, but to the years beyond that as well.","David Styblo","Okay, thanks.","Dan Glaser","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dan Glaser for any additional or closing remarks.","Dan Glaser","Thank you, operator. And thanks to everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to convey my appreciation to our clients for their support and give a special shout-out to all of our [65,000 colleagues] for continuing to deliver outstanding results for our clients and for our shareholders. We have two core priorities right now at Marsh & McLennan. First, execute on our plan; and second, set up a great integration with JLT. And I am delighted with the progress that we are making on both fronts. So, thank you all very much. Enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","Thank you.

I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations.","I recently returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. For the 12th consecutive year, the WEF released its annual global risk report, which was prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan Companies and other partners. The report highlights the social and political risks that crystallized around the world in 2016 and examined some of their root causes, which include income and wealth disparity, a fraught geopolitical environment and disruptive technological change. The year also saw significant volatility in financial markets \u2013 Brexit, continued terrorist activity and a rising populism that challenges some of the basic tenets of capitalism and globalization.","We are certainly living in an age of VUCA, an acronym that stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. The complexity, quantity and speed of information today make it difficult for countries, companies and individuals to understand both risk and opportunity. For example, new technologies such as artificial intelligence are creating challenges from both a technological and governance standpoint. The cyber security landscape is likely to broaden to include critical infrastructure and governments in many parts of the world are less stable and perhaps less functional than previously thought. But there is also a silver lining. Technology is transforming the lives of billions of people for the better and will continue to play a vital role in promoting global prosperity.","Productivity and quality of life are measurably up in most corners of the world and healthcare innovation is providing new medical solutions that allow people to enjoy longer and healthier lives. This is an extreme case of best of times, worst of times. It is the best time for those who are agile and innovate. At the same time, the pace of innovation is creating new risks, ones that will be amplified if companies are on the wrong side of social, political and environmental issues. The challenges are daunting, but there is more opportunity than ever before and our clients need advice and solutions around the globe.","We continue to execute a simple yet effective strategy to be a trusted advisor around the issues of risk, strategy and people. With this backdrop, we see strong demand for our services. Marsh & McLennan Companies is positioned for long-term growth and our competitive advantages will be put to good use.","Now let\u2019s discuss our performance. We capped off another excellent year with a strong fourth quarter, which Mark will discuss in more detail. In the fourth quarter, we produced underlying revenue growth of 3% on a consolidated basis, including 5% growth in RIS and 2% growth in consulting. We also delivered double-digit growth and adjusted EPS, driven by higher operating income with strong margin expansion. In terms of our full-year performance, MMC had an excellent year delivering underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and strong growth in adjusted EPS.","At the same time, we continue to keep our annual commitments to shareholders, to increase dividends per share by double digits and to reduce our total shares outstanding. And we continue to grow the firm through acquisitions, building our market position, capabilities, client services and geographic footprint. Looking at our 2016 results in more detail, consolidated revenue exceeded $13 billion with underlying revenue up 3%. Underlying revenue growth was balanced with both the risk and insurance services and consulting segments rising 3%. Within RIS, underlying revenue growth was 3% at Marsh and 2% at Guy Carpenter.","2016 marks Marsh\u2019s sixth straight year of underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range. Despite rate and other pressures faced in recent years by reinsurance brokers, Guy Carpenter has produced underlying revenue growth every year since 2009, a solid achievement. Within consulting, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman delivered underlying revenue growth of 3%. Mercer\u2019s consistent record of underlying revenue growth between 3% and 4% continued for the sixth straight year. Oliver Wyman finished the year strong overcoming a challenging third quarter.","MMC continues to generate positive operating leverage as adjusted operating income rose 10% to $2.7 billion in 2016. Our adjusted margin increased 140 basis points, our ninth consecutive year of margin improvement. Similar to our revenue growth, margin expansion was balanced across the segments with RIS rising 140 basis points to 24.7% and consulting up 130 basis points to 18.6%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing the business properly to grow revenue and earnings.","EPS on both a GAAP and adjusted basis increased by double digits. GAAP EPS rose 13% to $3.38 and adjusted EPS increased 12% to a record $3.42. Since 2009, adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.3%. We are proud of our track record on our journey to being among the elite growth companies of the world. MMC has consistently delivered strong financial performance over many years. We have come a long way since we began this journey nine years ago.","Over that period, our adjusted operating income has nearly tripled to $2.7 billion and our adjusted margin increased from 8.8% to 20.5%. This performance has compared favorably to the broader market. Over the past nine years, MMC\u2019s annual EPS growth has exceeded the S&P 500 by an average of 7 points. While we may not accomplish this every year, we do expect to grow EPS at a higher rate than the S&P 500 over long stretches of time with lower capital requirements and lower levels of risk.","Let\u2019s spend a few minutes on how we are positioning the firm for continued future growth. We invest to grow MMC both organically and through acquisitions. We have been improving the mix of business over several years by focusing our investment in growth areas while divesting or deemphasizing other parts of the business. Acquisitions are an important part of our balanced capital allocation strategy. Since 2009, we have committed nearly $6 billion across roughly 130 transactions. We invest to enhance the growth rate of the overall firm across three target areas, geography, segments and capabilities.","Recent examples include our expansion throughout Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and South Africa; Marsh\u2019s buildout of MMA and our UK SME strategy; the emergence at Marsh and Guy Carpenter of the cyber, flood and mortgage practices; investments at Mercer such as Workday implementation capabilities, global health and benefits technology and the Mercer Marketplace Health Exchange; and investments in Oliver Wyman and their digital technology and analytics platform; as well as continued pursuit of high-growth areas, including healthcare and public sector. These focused growth areas now account for over 25% of our total revenues, up from just 10% in 2010.","We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of MMC over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth. We are building the Company for the long term. We allocate capital based upon maximizing returns and increasing the future earnings power of MMC. This takes discipline and consistency as share repurchase will almost always be more accretive in the short term. We will always choose long-term value creation, which is in the best interest of our clients, colleagues and shareholders. We manage the firm to deliver not just in a given year, but to invest and build for the future. We believe MMC is positioned to deliver strong growth as the benefits of these investments emerge over time.","Looking at 2017, we see the operating environment as broadly similar to last year, including modest global economic growth, political instability and foreign currency fluctuations. We see geopolitical risk, specifically its impact on foreign exchange rates, being a potential downside, but difficult to predict. That said, I have more hope than I had six months ago with regard to the U.S. around GDP growth, inflation, interest rates and possible U.S. corporate tax reform. Consolidated underlying revenue has grown in the range of 3% to 5% for the last seven years and we view this as the likely outcome for 2017. In addition, we expect to expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders.","Before closing, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions. Our talented colleagues and how they serve clients are core to our long-term success. Companies that do well over long stretches of time can become complacent. Our culture guards against this. It is striving and challenging. It acknowledges that change is good and there is always a better way. This ensures a constant search for innovation, creativity and efficiency. It is my privilege to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by its core values of integrity, respect, inclusion and transparency. Our diversity of thought and cohesiveness are key strengths. We take our commitments seriously and we have delivered year after year.","In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategic and operational objectives for growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our fourth quarter performance.","Mark McGivney","Thank you, Dan and good morning. In the fourth quarter, MMC\u2019s performance was strong with underlying revenue growth at all of our operating companies, margin expansion in both segments and double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% or 3% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 6% while adjusted operating income rose 16% to $676 million. GAAP EPS rose 18% to $0.84 with adjusted EPS increasing 25% to $0.89 and our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 20.1%.","As we stated on last quarter\u2019s call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvement on a year-to-date basis. As Dan mentioned, for the full year, MMC\u2019s consolidated adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points. At Risk and Insurance Services, fourth quarter revenue rose 4% to $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $421 million and the margin expanded 240 basis points to 23.5%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 4% to $1.6 billion. On an underlying basis, revenue increased 5% led by solid contributions from all major geographies. The U.S.\/Canada division underlying growth was 4%. The International division underlying growth was 5%. EMEA really 5%; Asia-Pacific was up 4%; and Latin America grew 7%, which came on top of 13% growth in the prior-year quarter.","In the fourth quarter, Marsh completed its acquisition of Bluefin Insurance Group. Bluefin will be combined with Jelf, which we acquired at the end of 2015, to create a leading SME insurance broker in the UK with more than 2,500 employees serving over 250,000 clients in 80 locations. In addition, this week, MMA completed the acquisition of Jay Smith Lanier, one of the largest privately held insurance brokers in the United States. JSL has annual revenue of approximately $130 million with 600 employees in 21 offices across the Southeast.","With this addition, MMA\u2019s annualized revenue now exceeds $1 billion. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $222 million, an increase of 3% on both a reported and underlying basis. Underlying growth came on top of 5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue rose 2%. Consulting\u2019s adjusted operating income increased 13% to $299 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points to 18.9%. Mercer\u2019s underlying revenue increased 1% to $1.1 billion. Investments grew 10% while talent increased 3%. Health decreased 1% and retirement was down 3%.","In the quarter, Mercer completed the acquisition of Thomsons Online Benefits, a leading global benefit software business. By combining our consulting and broking expertise with Thomson\u2019s technology platform, we further position ourselves for sustained leadership and benefits globally. Over the last few months, Julio and his team have undertaken a review of Mercer\u2019s organization. Following this review, Mercer decided to implement a number of changes, including simplifying the organization and reducing layers, all of which is intended to improve speed of decision-making, agility and efficiency.","Fourth quarter results reflect a restructuring charge of $33 million that we have excluded from our adjusted results. Mercer expects additional restructuring charges of approximately $10 million in the first half of 2017. Oliver Wyman returned to growth in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $486 million with underlying growth of 4%, a bit better than we had expected. Results were driven by strength across several practices, including a strong performance in the public sector. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, in the first quarter, Oliver Wyman faces a difficult comparison to the 15% underlying revenue growth in last year\u2019s Q1.","We are well-positioned for continued progress in 2017. This year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and strong growth in earnings per share. As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you on our global retirement plans. As discussed on our last earnings call, we closed our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016 and froze future benefit accruals. As a result, we were required to remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. This remeasurement resulted in incremental pension expense of less than $0.01 per share in the quarter.","Moving to 2017 retirement expense, many factors go into determining the year-end measurement of our global pension expense. Beyond changes in discount rates and asset return, GAAP pension expense takes into account projected salary increases, mortality rates, demographics, inflation and contribution. Based on our year-end valuations, we expect our global retirement expense to decrease by approximately $30 million in 2017.","Moving to foreign exchange. As we anticipated on last quarter\u2019s call, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect the effect of foreign exchange on 2017 operating income will be a slight negative. Investment income was $2 million in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the prior year. For the full year 2016, investment income was less than $1 million compared with $38 million in 2015.","Following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5% compared with 29.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The lower rate in the quarter reflects several items, including geographic mix of earnings and the recognition of some discrete items.","For the year 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28% compared with 28.7% in 2015. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for 2017. Before I talk about our balance sheet and capital deployment, I want to reiterate the key elements of our corporate finance strategy. We talk about balance in many aspects of our strategy and our approach to capital allocation and our balance sheet is no exception. Our current position strikes a balance between the efficiency of our capital structure and prudent flexibility to pursue opportunities or manage through disruption.","Since 2013, we\u2019ve added more than $2.5 billion of debt to our balance sheet and reduced our cash balances by around $1 billion. Notwithstanding these moves, our balance sheet leverage remains well-positioned relative to our peers and the broader market. When we plan for capital deployment, the amount we target is a combination of the free cash flow we generate and the debt capacity we create from our strong earnings growth. This allows us to maintain our leverage ratio at its current level while deploying substantial amounts of capital.","In terms of capital return, we have two annual commitments to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend per share at a double-digit rate and we will repurchase enough shares to reduce our share count. We establish these commitments for a reason. Very few companies are able to consistently increase dividends and reduce shares outstanding over long periods of time and the ones that do tend to significantly outperform the market.","Beyond these commitments, capital deployed will be balanced across reinvestment in the business through acquisitions and other investments and returning excess capital to shareholders. We have a preference for reinvestment, but also recognize that returning capital through share repurchase can produce substantial returns as well. Our corporate finance strategy is consistent with our overall strategy, striking a balance between delivering solid results today while positioning for the future.","Corporate debt at year-end 2016 was $4.8 billion, including $50 million of commercial paper outstanding. In January, we added an additional $1 billion of debt as part of our planned financing for 2017. Considering the $250 million debt maturity in April, we expect the net increase to overall debt in 2017 to be about $750 million. We project interest expense will be approximately $225 million with Q1 slightly higher than the rest of the year due to the April debt maturity. Cash on our balance sheet at year-end was just over $1 billion, which was down from about $1.4 billion at the end of 2015. Cash in the U.S. stood at $184 million.","Uses of cash in the fourth quarter totaled over $1.1 billion and included $175 million for share repurchase, $178 million for dividends, and $778 million for acquisitions. For the full year, our uses of cash totaled nearly $2.5 billion and included $800 million for share repurchase, $682 million for dividends and $1 billion for acquisitions. In 2016, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by 8 million shares and increased our dividends per share by 10%. For 2017, we expect to deploy capital in line with the level in 2016 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.","With that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Mark. Derek, we are ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Quentin McMillan with KBW.","Quentin McMillan","Good morning. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Mark, very much for the color. Just about the restructuring charge in the Mercer business of $33 million, can you just help us understand what you are investing in there? You said $10 million of potential outlay for the first half. What is that going to help organic growth in Mercer and what specific divisions may that be?","Dan Glaser","Okay, so, Julio, you want to take that.","Julio Portalatin","Yes, sure. Yes. Thanks, Quentin. Part of our approach at Mercer has always been to be very disciplined in the way we look at our businesses and constantly challenge ourselves on how best to serve our clients, their needs and further drive growth and improve profitability and we\u2019ve been doing that quite consistently over the years that I have had the opportunity to lead this great organization. Most of the times when we do these reviews and take whatever actions, we where those in our operating results, whatever they might be.","This time, we are taking a small charge, certainly small relative to our overall base of $4.4 billion in revenue. One of the things we\u2019ve done is we have created a wealth business, which basically allows us to take the retirement and the investment business, put it together and allow it to offer a value proposition against all of the asset management client needs across the entire spectrum. This reflects really how our clients want to do business with us. They are making decisions on managing and providing retirement benefits to their employees in ways that cut across these two businesses and we\u2019ve made that easier for them to do and easier to do business with us.","We also thought more broadly throughout the Company to provide a simplified and faster decision-making outcome by delayering, increasing spans of control, empowering decision-making closer to the client with the intent, of course, to be simpler and more agile. All of these actions will help us drive simplicity, agility and empowerment and ultimately, yes, we want to drive more growth too. That\u2019s what our intent is or else we wouldn\u2019t be doing it, and as time goes on, I think we will be able to see some of that.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Julio. Anything else Quentin?","Quentin McMillan","Great. And then \u2013 yes, just a quick question. You guys did the Bluefin acquisition. Can you tell us how much cash you have left overseas and then a bigger picture question with that is if the new administration does have a repatriation and a benefit on the tax side for that, would you guys repatriate the majority of your overseas capital and would that change anything in terms of your outlook for maybe share repurchases or other opportunities within the U.S.?","Dan Glaser","Okay. So a couple of things and then I will hand over to Mark to give you a little bit more detail. Over a long stretch of time, we have developed ways to effectively bring back the cash that we need from our overseas operation without putting undue stress on our overall tax rate. But having said that, we absolutely believe, as a matter of U.S. competitiveness, that a territorial system, which matches up with the rest of the OECD, makes complete sense, not a tax holiday as a one-time kind of basis, but a permanent level of reform that unshackles U.S. corporations from having to even think about where cash is located where foreign competitors do not. But Mark, do you want to add to that.","Mark McGivney","Sure. Quentin, in terms of the cash offshore, so about $1 billion of cash I talked about, as I mentioned $184 million or so of that is in the U.S. and the balance would be overseas and just to build on what Dan said. We have proven very effective of getting access to our global cash flows every year and so that we don\u2019t necessarily have trapped cash offshore, if you will, and what goes into the roundly $2.5 billion of capital we deployed this year is getting full access to our free cash flow around the world.","Quentin McMillan","Perfect. Thanks very much, guys.","Dan Glaser","Thanks, Quentin. Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question is on the brokerage organic growth, 5%, very strong in the quarter. Could you give a little bit more color on that, especially in EMEA? Do you see any sort of like lifting uncertainty post-Brexit that could help the growth going forward?","Dan Glaser","I mean one of the things, Kai and then I will hand off to Peter because you mentioned EMEA specifically. It\u2019s interesting that EMEA has grown underlying revenue for 24 straight quarters. So it has been a stalwart within Marsh\u2019s overall performance, which has been consistently solid across many years. Peter, do you want to give some more color?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Dan, and thanks, Kai. We are really pleased and proud, as you pointed out, on our fourth quarter results with 5% underlying growth. We had equal contributions from the U.S. and Canada and International. I think it\u2019s important to take a look at the year though where we had 3% underlying growth, really strong contributions from many parts of the world. If there is one bright spot within the year that I would like to point out it would be our new business growth and so we are attracting new clients and that was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter. We had a slower start to the year, but obviously a much stronger finish.","The components of the growth, as I said, were terrific new business led by the U.S. core brokerage business. We had solid renewal growth because we had strong new business in the fourth quarter last year. So overall contributing to strong growth in the fourth quarter. If I was to comment on EMEA specifically, as you pointed out, again a very strong quarter, a lot of this was driven by renewal growth in Continental Europe had a very strong new business year in the fourth quarter 2015. Several additional bright spots within EMEA were Middle East had a terrific quarter, its best quarter of the year. And Africa had strong organic growth. In addition, we had very good new business in the UK. So overall all components of EMEA contributing.","Dan Glaser","Thanks. Kai, any other questions?","Kai Pan","Yes, a follow-up on the M&A, now $1 billion total revenue. I just wonder are you sort of better integrating that business with the rest of Marsh or you leave it around to just preserve that entrepreneurship. I just wonder any synergy between these two like intraorganization.","Dan Glaser","There is some mild revenue synergy; very little expense synergy because we are not going to pick up nickels in front of a steamroller. The very idea of us creating that division is to maintain its entrepreneurial spirit, its separate approach and it\u2019s a different kind of business and so we have no intention of integrating MMA into Marsh.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much.","Dan Glaser","Next question.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll hear from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks, good morning. I guess just thinking about the end of the year and Mercer, I guess 1% organic growth. Maybe you guys could just give a little bit more detail about the fourth quarter there I guess in particular and health benefits where it looked like organic declined?","Dan Glaser","Absolutely. I think Julio is very happy to be in the first quarter of 2017 because we\u2019ve been talking about the fourth quarter for about the last month. [Indiscernible] Julio?","Julio Portalatin","Okay, thanks. Thanks. Thanks, Ryan. Let me give a little bit of a panoramic view. Mercer across all [indiscernible] globally, okay, so let\u2019s just start there and then I\u2019ll get back to health, has been operating in a 3% to 4% world for quite some time and over the course of the year, of course, quarters will vacillate and they will fluctuate. Our 2016 global Mercer results continue in that same range with underlying revenue growth of 3% and strong earnings growth, of course and further margin expansion. And that\u2019s probably where I would think of Mercer in 2017 as well.","So health, it did have a pullback in the fourth quarter, but, as I mentioned, we don\u2019t really want to focus too much on one quarter, but rather look at the year\u2019s performance, which in the case of health again was around 3%. We did have, in the fourth quarter, some client retention that held up rather well quite frankly and we were pleased to see that. We like to see our clients sticking around for us to continue to sell additional project work to, but we did have some softness in that project work in the fourth quarter.","And I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be surprising to hear that some of our prospects and clients are indeed taking a bit longer to make decisions as they wait for the impact of the potential changes that are going to be coming about, especially in the areas of the ACA and others. So it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that some softness would be picked up. But health remains a very profitable and growing business for Mercer. We expect this business will continue to be a strong contributor for Mercer. So thank you.","Dan Glaser","And also Ryan that to give the 1% too much of a pass, but it was a pretty tough comparator because Mercer grew 5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Any other questions?","Ryan Tunis","Yes. Just I appreciate that you guys don\u2019t target margins. It\u2019s a product I guess of organic revenues, organic expenses, but one thing that I guess stood out to me this quarter in RIS was, if I just look at the expense base and kind of adjust for acquisitions and currency, it looked like organic expense growth was pretty close to flat on the quarter. I was just wondering if there is something going on in terms of an organic expense management story there, if there is something you are doing differently where you think, I don\u2019t know, structurally or cyclically at this point you think that you can \u2013 you don\u2019t necessarily need to grow organic expenses at kind of the 2% to 3% level you\u2019ve talked about historically. Thanks.","Dan Glaser","Let me talk about margins a little bit broadly and then I will hand over to Peter to get into RIS a little bit on the margin front. The first thing you have to do is look at the full year and rolling four quarters as well. The longer stretches the better. You are very right that we don\u2019t have a margin target, but having said that, we have improved margins for nine consecutive years and actually we are about 1,200 basis points higher from where we started this journey, so margin growth has been a big part of our overall performance. When you asked whether we are doing anything differently in terms of managing our organic expense growth, the answer is yes. And it has been yes every year for nine years. We are continually finding ways of creating more value in our business. We believe we are in a more for less business with clients. We have to deliver more value to them at lower internal cost year after year.","And so our search for efficiency, our culture of there\u2019s always a smarter way of doing something is rooted deeply within the organization. And so when we look at the overall company for the quarter, we only grew expense 1% and for the year, we grew expense 2%, but pretty consistently over nine years, we have grown revenue at a faster pace than growing expense. Peter, do you want to talk about RIS?","Peter Zaffino","Sure, Dan. I\u2019ll just add a few comments on RIS. The adjusted NOI margin for the quarter was 240 basis points, but I think it\u2019s really important just to look at the full-year margin as the quarters can have considerable seasonality and so that was 140 basis points and it was helped by pension, but I think what Dan said in the earlier comments and he said many quarters is that the margin really does reflect the way that we run the business. Historically, we\u2019ve made a lot of investments. We grow revenue greater than expense and during that period, we\u2019ve had a number of investments that have increased efficiencies. We are adding headcount.","As of January, we will have over 900 producers in MMA, so that\u2019s a great example. We\u2019ve added headcount in Continental Europe, in Latin America, in Asia where we think there\u2019s real good opportunities to grow and on top of that, we\u2019ve been wearing intangible amortization, which has doubled since 2011 in our margin. So we have been very disciplined.","Dan Glaser","One thing to bear in mind as well in terms of overall margins when you look at the Company, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in both segments and so each segment year after year has delivered margin growth. And as Peter mentioned, for the year, pension was a help; FX was a help as well, but even subtracting out those two factors, we had strong margin expansion in both segments.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Next we have Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question is on Guy Carpenter. As we think about 2017, you guys have made a decent number of hires in that segment over the past year. How do you think about just the growth outlook for that business and the margin profile there? And when we think about growth picking up potentially for some of the hires from Guy Carpenter, is that something that we would see in 2017 or does it sometimes take longer for potentially thinking of you guys taking on business from some of your competitors in the space?","Dan Glaser","Okay. So I will hand off to Peter in a second to talk specifically about Guy Carpenter, but I would just say really broadly that we are a big company, so hiring people very rarely will move a needle for a $13 billion revenue company and every year, we attract a lot of talent into the organization. I think more than any other factor over the last nine years that has re-emerged within Marsh & McLennan Companies is that we are the employer of choice in our chosen industries and that we attract a tremendous amount of talent who want to come work in Marsh & McLennan.","So that level of strategic recruitment is very strong throughout the firm and the quality that we are adding within the firm is quite considerable. When you think about the new hiring we do in terms of strategic recruitment, combined with the attrition that we would normally have in any given year, you are talking about hiring something like 7000 people a year and so we take it really seriously. We run people through a labyrinth because ultimately we know we become who we hire. So we take that really seriously and we are really excited about not only Guy Carpenter, but the rest of the organization, the talent that we are able to attract into the firm. Peter, do you want to address GC specifically?","Peter Zaffino","Sure, Dan. Thanks. Elyse, let me just comment on the fourth quarter and the year for Guy Carpenter briefly. We had 3% underlying growth in the fourth quarter, their seasonally smallest quarter, but that was on top of 5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. So it was a tough comp for them, but they did very well. Very strong new business in the U.S., Asia and the global specialties. We continue to see rate decreases if we look at the fourth quarter led by property, but overall doing 2% for the year with Guy Carpenter, we were very pleased. We are making strategic investments. It\u2019s around people, data analytics and organizational design 2016 I think we accomplished a lot. Appointed new leaders. We continue to add and develop key talent.","One thing to note though, the headcount is not up. I mean we are creating our own space to invest by being more efficient. So overall we\u2019ve made some terrific hires that complement Guy Carpenter. We do believe it will help with production and top-line growth, but we are managing the headcount and expense and we have a lot of momentum and expect us to continue on the path that we have delivered over the past several years.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. And then if I tie together some of your comments on the 2017 outlook, it seems like the lower retirement expense is to some degree offset by the higher interest expense from the debt you guys issued. So when we think about potential EPS growth, you were about 12% in 2016. Your commentary on an organic basis would lead me to think 2017 might be a little bit better than 2016, just very high level. So how do you think EPS growth? Do you get closer to your 13% target in 2017 just based on where we sit today and how you are thinking about the economy and things like that kind of post the U.S. election?","Dan Glaser","Okay, so a few things. One, we are happy to inhabit this world that is filled with risk and uncertainty and the visibility is not clear. So while we feel pretty good about where we are sitting today in terms of the internal operations of Marsh & McLennan, we are still quite concerned about when we look at the rest of the world and we are impacted by macro factors and whether it\u2019s global GDP growth, for us specifically U.S. and UK GDP growth, P&C rates and premium growth, exposures, that sort of thing, 10-year yields, foreign exchanges. There\u2019s a whole plethora of things for us to stay up at night thinking about on a macro basis right. So you go back nine years ago, our issues were inside the shop; now it\u2019s really, well, what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world and there\u2019s enough things that keep us kind of on our toes.","Now having said that, it\u2019s certainly been a challenging environment all the way since the 2008 financial crisis and we have been able to generate 3% to 5% organic growth even in a difficult global economic environment with other macro factors, which are generally more headwinds than tailwinds. And so if we were making any predictions, and it\u2019s not guidance, it\u2019s kind of soft, we are kind of well, we\u2019ve been in 3% to 5% for a lot of years now, so we are probably still in 3% to 5%. The world doesn\u2019t seem like it has changed all that much and so that\u2019s I think where we are.","Now what does that mean for EPS? If you go back \u2013 first of all, our adjusted EPS CAGR since 2009 has been 13%, so we are proud of that delivery. It\u2019s very strong performance, market-leading and we\u2019ve delivered for shareholders. Now when we established that goal in 2010, our margins were much lower than they are today and clearly, it\u2019s just the math. It becomes more difficult to grow at that pace the higher your margins become and in fact, it can be counterproductive because you need more separation, more air between revenue growth and expense growth to drive the same amount of margin expansion. So while margin expansion was a key strategy of ours when you go back to where we were behind the pack in 2009, in 2010, in 2011, we are much more focused now on top-line growth and investing in the business for long- term performance than we are for any short-term margin expansion. Having said that, we do expect margin expansion in both segments in 2017.","We don\u2019t give guidance on EPS growth. I mean our 13% CAGR I remind you is over a long period of time. It\u2019s not any one year. It\u2019s not an annual target. We don\u2019t operate that way. We don\u2019t budget ourselves that way, but we expect 2017 to be a pretty decent year, but it\u2019s really too early to call where we will end up with that, but we are reasonably optimistic. We are certainly no more pessimistic than we were at this time last year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dan Glaser","Our next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Dave Styblo with Jefferies.","Dave Styblo","Thanks for the questions. I wanted to come back to taxes, more importantly, just to get a better understanding of how you guys might have considered Trump or Ryan\u2019s tax reform plans impacting you. I suppose there\u2019s so many moving parts here, but there is the direct penal impact from your corporate taxes benefitting and then maybe there\u2019s an offset from potentially repealing the deductibility of net interest expense and then maybe not immediately impacting you, but further down the line would be higher GDP growth from corporations outside of you investing and just needing more P&C and insurance overall. So have you guys sort of triangulated those data points to kind of get a better sense of maybe more near term how things could impact you versus longer-term?","Dan Glaser","The answer is yes, we spend a lot of time thinking about those different scenarios and we can drive ourselves crazy because nobody has any idea and it\u2019s only speculation as to what would actually happen. So let me really take it at a helicopter view as opposed to any of the specifics. I mean certainly corporate tax reform in the U.S. would improve U.S. competitiveness, spur investment and create jobs. And so we are absolutely encouraged that it is a priority of the new administration and several members of Congress to address our convoluted corporate tax system in the United States.","Having said that, we are not certain in any way, shape or form that there will be corporate tax reform in the U.S. so it remains a hope and not something for us to really strategize around. I mean it\u2019s fair to say that any corporate tax reform in the U.S. would be good for Marsh & McLennan Companies. How good would depend on the details of it. And just as an aside, we would say the bulk of any tax savings that we could receive will drop into earnings and improve free cash flow. But that\u2019s really all we have to say just the devil is in the details and it\u2019s only a potential benefit to us. I would just reaffirm that we\u2019ve executed regardless of our tax rate and it doesn\u2019t drive our strategy.","Dave Styblo","Sure, sure. Okay. And then, obviously, saw the headline on the national flood insurance program that has been finalized now. Can you talk a little bit more about the timing, the economics there? And then specifically it seems like the technical strengths that you showcased resonated. I\u2019m wondering if there is something there that could help signal what you are bringing to the table is superior and perhaps help with other RFP shots on goal.","Dan Glaser","Yes. Absolutely and I will hand over to Peter, but obviously we are thrilled with the win, particularly because when we evaluated the companies that would have enabled us to become a major player in the write your own flood market, we believe that Torrent had the best technology and was the best shop for the future and so it\u2019s nice to have that validated by at least one large entity. But Peter?","Peter Zaffino","Thanks, Dan. Let me describe a little bit about what Torrent is and then talk a little bit about the national flood program. Torrent is a best-in-class flood servicing company. It has terrific technology. We acquired Torrent in 2014 because, as Dan just outlined, we believe the company had built market-leading technology and would position Marsh to be a leader and innovator in the evolving flood insurance market. So that\u2019s the NFIP as well as the private market. We\u2019ve made good progress to date. Technology, again, that is industry-leading and the team has met expectations, so we are very excited about the future.","We are very pleased that FEMA formally appointed Torrent in January of 2017 as the direct servicing agent for the National Flood Insurance Program. Being selected as a contractor, we\u2019ll administer approximately 20% to 25% of the NFIP policies. So what you have seen publicly in terms of the estimated contract is based on the number of policies. So it could go up or down depending on the number of policies that go in and the guidance has been around $20 million to $25 million annually, so it\u2019s a four-year appointment with an opportunity to extend for an additional year.","Some of the things that I think that they found attractive was our ability to help facilitate NFIP\u2019s response to flood events, improving the customer experience for the policyholders, maintaining data security and delivering continuous innovation. Those are just some of the highlights and we really look forward to working with the federal government to improve its performance and we are excited to get going.","Dave Styblo","Thanks, Peter.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Dan Glaser","Good morning.","Charles Sebaski","Just have a general question on the business overall on how \u2013 you talked, I guess, Dan, more on the more for less as a business philosophy of what you guys are having to deliver. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything changing with regard to the relationship between organic growth and the ability to drive efficiencies in the business? I\u2019m wondering if be it technology, be it other components of what\u2019s driving operating leverage and if the long-term relationship between ability to gain efficiencies is the same or equally dependent on organic growth as it has been in the past.","Dan Glaser","Yes. Well, we absolutely believe that there\u2019s linkage between revenue and expense and that is \u2013 in a consulting firm and a brokerage firm like we have, the one thing that we can control is expense whereas revenue is really how are you positioned. Are you investing on the expense side in the right things to remain strategically relevant to your client base? So we spend a lot of time thinking about the customer experience and what clients will need, what is a day in the life of a client three years from now and trying to position ourselves to be able to provide value to that client out into the future. And obviously, that means a little bit more on analytics, a little bit more on data analysis, a little bit more, but not necessarily losing that high touch relationship manager, face to face because we still think that remains very relevant in the businesses that we operate.","The world is changing fast and I think that there are a lot more efficiencies to come. Even though we are experimenting, we have very little use of robotics or artificial intelligence or deep learning within our businesses today in any material way and so who knows where that can lead us. Ultimately, the package of what we deliver and what we focus on is more about what do we think clients not only need today, but what will they need in the future, are we positioned to deal with that, what are our gaps and that\u2019s where our investments are. But this is a brains business, a people business and the most fundamental factor is do we have a group of smart, hard-working, dedicated, client-centered people working in a collaborative, cohesive environment and so the cultural aspect we view as a competitive advantage that is going to endure for a long period of time and there is not too many companies in the world like Marsh & McLennan Companies.","Charles Sebaski","Appreciate that. I guess just maybe a numbers or an understanding. On some of the recent acquisitions, Bluefin, Jay Smith, just coming into 2017, given the size, is there any seasonality to those businesses and how they are going to earn through next year that we should just keep aware of?","Dan Glaser","Peter, do you want to address that?","Peter Zaffino","There is no seasonality that I would draw your attention to. If you look MMA as a business, it is very consistent quarter-to-quarter, roughly 25% of their revenue in each of the quarters and so I wouldn\u2019t guide you towards any one particular quarter that we would be lower or higher.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much for the answers.","Dan Glaser","Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Thank you very much everyone. I realize there\u2019s \u2013 people have questions about tax. We don\u2019t know anything. In the age of not knowing anything yet, does that change how much you are willing to pay or how much the way you are going to finance a large deal if you were to do one?","Dan Glaser","Yes. I will take that a little bit and then I will hand over to Mark to address that a little bit more detail. I mean first of all, we\u2019ve had a string-of-pearls strategy more than anything else. We have not done what I would consider to be large acquisitions for quite some time within the firm. We\u2019ve done an aggregation of the many, I mean something like 130 acquisitions over the last six or seven years and so, obviously, the integration risks when we do integrate are far smaller. Due diligence is far crisper and clearer and that has been our focus. I mean who knows what the future would hold on that, but largely because the acquisitions are not very large in nature, we\u2019ve been not using much financing. It\u2019s been mainly using cash. But Mark, do you want to take that?","Mark McGivney","Yes, just a comment on value. We will see where things come out, but obviously U.S. firms, they have more cash flow and so it could increase value of things, and of course, they are more valuable because of the higher cash flows coming out. In terms of impact on how we finance or our capital structure, at this point, I don\u2019t think so. We will see what the change could be, but I don\u2019t see it having a \u2013 fundamentally changing our view on our overall capital structure.","Dan Glaser","The other thing I would just add to it is we\u2019ve talked about MMA before many times because MMA, one, we are very satisfied with the agency and we have committed over $2.5 billion of capital since 2009, so it\u2019s been our biggest capital deployment in any one segment. And the returns have been good and of course, our returns on the investments that we have already made assume the high U.S. level of tax rate and we are satisfied with those returns. So if ultimately the U.S. tax rate comes down, it means the money that we\u2019ve already committed, that $2.5 billion return profile, is far better than the good returns that we are already receiving and so it is a huge potential positive for us.","Josh Shanker","And I would assume any benefit from a lower tax rate that comes into EPS, would that money get reinvested in the business, or would you have a plan to return that directly to shareholders?","Dan Glaser","At the end, we\u2019ve been returning more capital to shareholders than our free cash flow and we expect to do that in 2017 as well. Our view on whether there\u2019s lower taxes in the U.S., and now largely the bulk of that would fall into earnings and fall into free cash flow and then we would use our regular balanced capital allocation strategy to return that money to shareholders through not only organic investments, but as well as dividend policy, acquisitions and share repurchase.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Status quo. Thank you very much. Take care.","Dan Glaser","Sure. Next question please.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Dan Glaser","Okay, fantastic. Well, I would just like to thank everybody for joining us this morning and specifically thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. Have a good day.","Operator","Once again that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."]}}
