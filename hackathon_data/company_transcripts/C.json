Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions].","Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. ","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.6 billion for the first quarter of 2018 or $1.68 per share. Our quarter showed strong and balanced performance as we continued to capture client-led growth, and we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day. Our earnings per share were 24% higher than 1 year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans. Relative to a year ago, we grew revenues by 3%, improved our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, increased our return on assets to 98 basis points and improved our return on tangible common equity to 11.4%. We grew loans in our core businesses by 7% or $44 billion from last year, and we ended the quarter with over $1 trillion in deposits.","Global Consumer Banking had a good all-around quarter with 6% revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region. In the U.S., we continued to make progress with our Citigold Wealth Management offering and also had growth in retail services. In branded cards, we saw the underlying revenue growth that we projected, driven by an increase in interest-earning balances and strong client engagement. And in Mexico and Asia, we saw momentum in both retail banking and cards.","Our Institutional Clients Group had another solid quarter. While Fixed Income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our Equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results. We also saw ongoing momentum in TTS, our Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services as we continued to grow these stable accrual-type businesses. While Investment Banking revenue was down, we held on to the wallet share gains we've made in recent years, and client engagement remained strong. ","In addition to improving our return on capital, we continued to make progress in improving the return of capital for our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $3 billion in capital to our shareholders, helping to reduce our common shares outstanding by over 200 million shares from 1 year ago or 7%. We will complete our current $19 billion capital return plan in the second quarter, and we recently submitted our plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle. We believe we remain on track to meet the commitment we outlined at Investor Day of returning at least $60 billion over the 2017, '18 and '19 cycles, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.","The environment remains unique, to say the least. We have synchronized global growth in a macroeconomic environment which is as positive as we've seen since before the financial crisis. U.S. corporations are starting to see the benefits of tax reform. The labor market is tight, and wage growth continues to improve. At the same time, though, there are concurrently escalating and deescalating tensions depending on the day and geography. And while our markets business may appreciate the volatility, we'd be better served by steady and predictable growth and having our fundamentally robust economy do its thing.","With that, John will go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. Net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. EPS grew 24%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in Corp\/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets. Expenses increased 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.","Our efficiency ratio was 57.9% for the quarter, roughly 50 basis points better than last year, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency improvement. And cost of credit increased, mostly driven by the institutional business as well as volume growth and seasoning in consumer. Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter, and RoTCE improved to 11.4%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $44 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer as well as TTS to Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending.","Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 37% in the first quarter, driven by operating margin and EBIT growth in each region as well as a lower tax rate. Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year and were up 4%, excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our U.S.-branded cards business. From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards delivered 3% revenue growth, excluding Hilton, driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region.","Slide 5 shows the results from North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 4% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continued to decline, mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity. Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower mortgage escrow deposits. We generated 2% growth in checking deposits this quarter, driven largely by our Citigold segment. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. And in keeping with this focus on Wealth Management, assets under management were up 10% year-over-year to $61 billion. ","We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products, and we're continuing to drive our digital transformation as well. As part of our mobile-first strategy, we've been developing capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients. And we're now at a point where we can leverage these digital capabilities to acquire and service a broader range of retail banking customers. Our recently announced launch of national digital banking is key to this next step in our transformation, designed to meet all the clients' needs through mobile banking, including the ability to seamlessly open a new Citibank retail account within the mobile app. We believe these capabilities will allow us to expand beyond our core markets and build a national presence, but we recognize that this build-out will take time. New features will begin to roll out towards the end of the second quarter, followed by a promotional campaign beginning in the third quarter. ","Turning to branded cards. Revenues were roughly flat from last year, excluding the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. Client engagement remained strong with average loans growing by 5% and purchase sales up 8% year-over-year. We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continued to mature, as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances. Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our U.S.-branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook. ","Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2%, driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 2% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings. We continue to drive transaction volumes through lower-cost channels, and digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.","Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, and we billed roughly $119 million of loan loss reserve this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning. Our NCL rate in U.S.-branded cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 518 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018.","On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 8% with contribution from every business and region. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8%. Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. And card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.","Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter and were up 6%, excluding the benefit of a modest onetime gain. Excluding the gain, retail banking grew 6%, driven by our Wealth Management business, reflecting favorable market conditions. And card revenues grew 5% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was essentially flat.","Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit continued to be broadly favorable again this quarter. In North America, the NCL rate increased sequentially, reflecting seasonality in cards, while delinquencies remained stable. And trends remained stable to improving in Mexico and Asia as well.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8. Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses [indiscernible] a very strong performance in Equities this quarter. Total banking revenues of $4.8 billion grew 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 8%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity. Private Bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.4 billion declined 7% year-over-year. Corporate client activity remained strong, driving growth in G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies. However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 Rates and spread products, in particular in March. Equities revenues were up 38% with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation as well as a higher level of investment spending. And finally, cost of credit was a benefit this quarter, driven by net ratings upgrades and continued stability in commodity prices.","Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $591 million declined 51% from last year, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 35%, also reflecting the wind-down. And the pretax loss in Corp\/Other was $143 million this quarter, slightly better than our outlook, mostly due to a greater benefit from legacy asset sales. Looking ahead, we believe an outlook for pretax losses in the range of around $200 million to $250 million per quarter in Corp\/Other is a fair run rate for the remainder of 2018. This is an improvement from our prior outlook of quarterly losses in the range of $250 million to $300 million based on somewhat higher treasury revenues, given the higher rate environment as well as the lower expenses.","Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue and a contribution from our legacy assets in Corp\/Other. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion this quarter grew slightly from last year. Core accrual net interest revenues grew by $750 million, but this was largely offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind-down of legacy assets. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower day count. And our core accrual net interest margin improved by 8 basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher-yielding assets. On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we've added the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June. Legacy asset-related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio. And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.","On Slide 11, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income. And our tangible book value per share increased to $61.","In summary, we made good progress towards our longer-term goals this quarter with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage and a significant improvement in net income and returns. Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect top line growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets. Operating efficiency should again show progress against the prior year period with more significant improvement to come in the second half of the year. Cost of credit should increase quarter-over-quarter, assuming that credit normalizes in ICG. And the tax rate should be closer to 25%. ","Turning to the businesses in more detail. In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia. In U.S.-branded cards, as described earlier, excluding Hilton, we expect continued underlying revenue growth as loan balances are maturing as expected. However, this should continue to be largely offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January. And of course, we will also see a year-over-year impact from the sale of the Hilton portfolio. ","On the institutional side, markets revenues should reflect the overall operating environment. However, we would typically expect a seasonal decline in trading revenues from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues should improve quarter-over-quarter, assuming favorable market conditions. And we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network. ","In addition, we're looking forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter. At Investor Day last year, we stated our goal of returning at least $20 billion of capital to shareholders as part of the 2018 CCAR process. And subject to regulatory approval, we believe we remain on track to do so.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","John, I wanted to ask about the longer-term efficiency target. You're still targeting the low 50s on the efficiency ratio. Did the accounting changes change that goal? And could you remind us what the time line for getting to that efficiency goal is over the next few years?","John Gerspach","Yes. Sure, John. Yes, the accounting changes impacted our overall efficiency by 50, 60 basis points, so I don't think that, that really changes our target of getting into the low 50s at all. And again, our target there is to get into those low 50s by 2020. So that's still our target, and we still figure that we're on progress to do that.","John McDonald","Okay. From the outside, it looks like you're really going to need an acceleration in 2019 and 2020. The current pace seems like 100 basis points of improvement a year. And if you're kind of at 57%, 58%, what would drive that acceleration in '19, '20? Could you talk a little bit about maybe the spending arcs that you're doing on investing and maybe the savings that you expect? Are those going to ramp up and drive it? Or is it all revenue assumptions that drive this improvement in the out-years?","John Gerspach","No, no, no. Fair question, John, fair question. But we targeted this year for another 100 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. Now I'll give you the fact that when you take a look at the first quarter efficiency ratio of 57.9%, it certainly is above the 57% target that we got in place for the full year, but it's not inconsistent with our plan for the rest of the year. And so when you look at the rest of the year, I think you have to expect continued top line momentum. We talked about, more or less, 3% sustained revenue growth, but there's also several drivers in play as it relate to the expense base. First, as we mentioned in some of the commentary, expenses related to legacy assets should continue to decline as we complete the existing TSAs and continue to wind down the assets themselves.","Second, incentive-related comp tends to be a little bit more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, and that's consistent with historic revenue trends in markets. And finally, as I noted, I believe when I spoke at the RBC conference, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise to both to continue top line momentum as well as to capture significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. Now we're seeing much of the year-over-year impact of growth in these investments in the first half of 2018. So think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front-end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year. And so when you get growth in the core businesses, we will certainly have some volume-related expenses growing. But altogether, the second half expense profile should set us up well for achieving larger improvements in our efficiency ratio, both in the second half of this year and then into 2019 and into 2020.","John McDonald","Okay. So you do -- right, you are saying that to get to that math to work, you do have to have more than 100 basis points improvement in '19 to get to 2020 low 50s","John Gerspach","Yes. That fact has been noticed by me.","John McDonald","Okay, okay. And is there also -- just one more on this. Do you have some kind of uptake in mobile adoption and maybe planned shrinkage of call centers or data centers related to this that will pick up in later years? Is that part of the plan as well?","John Gerspach","That's exactly part of the plan, John. That's all in, again, some of the investments that we continue to make in digital and mobile. At Investor Day, we talked about achieving $1.5 billion of annual efficiency savings in consumer. And I think we've made significant progress in some of the investments, and we are certainly on track to achieve those savings. But again, you haven't seen the bulk of those savings yet. Those are savings that we expect to come on in the second half of this year and then even more so in '19 and '20. As you know, key to achieving these savings is the drive towards creating self-service, digital and mobile capabilities. And those capabilities, we think, are designed both to enhance the client experience but also, at the same time, driving operational efficiencies through reducing customer calls and paper statements.","John McDonald","Okay. That's helpful, John. And the second thing for me is just on the new proposals, the SCB proposal that we saw come out this week. Is that in line what you're thinking of the 11.5% CET1 ratio target? I know you kind of incorporated SCB into that, but could that evolve over time in terms of how much management buffer you're putting on your regulatory minimums and your thoughts on that?","John Gerspach","Yes, John. At Investor Day, when we laid out the 11.5% for you last year as being our target, we discussed various components embedded in that target. And one of those components included a stressed capital buffer, which we estimated at 3%. And the details of the NPR that got released earlier this week, as far as we can see, they're broadly consistent with what we expected in terms of the structure of the new framework and certainly the expected impact on the minimum capital requirements. So to have a direct answer to your question, if I had, had the documents that got released earlier this week, last July, we wouldn't have changed either the 3% estimate of an SCB or the target CET1 of 11.5%. And as we discussed then, one of the things that we recognized is that the proposed rule is going to create a certain amount of variability in a firm's requirements. We put in 100 basis point management buffer that I think we described at that point in time as being in place to actually address the variability or the volatility associated with the SCB as well as OCI movements. So as we get further into the discussion about the SCB, I do think that it's going to cause managements to need to address how they're using management buffers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","John, follow-up to your comments when we talked about NII and the trading-related NII and ICT having headwinds in a rising rate environment. I just want to make sure, is that just natural funding costs of more wholesale-funded business? Can you hedge or reverse that if you felt like it and had a view on rates? Can you pass it through to customers that are using your balance sheet? Just curious to get your thoughts on that.","John Gerspach","Well, the answer to all of those questions is, well, first, yes. It is just natural within that business. I think maybe on the last earnings call, I mentioned the fact that if you actually look at the trading-related assets and liabilities that are in the average balance sheet that we give you in the supplement, you'll see that the trading-related liabilities cover, more or less, 50% of the trading-related assets. And so the balance is subject -- is funded through wholesale means. Can we do hedging on it? I guess you could. But don't forget, when you get into the trading businesses, a lot of what drives NII also is how different trades are structured. So there's a structural element of the balance sheet, but I don't think that we want to get into putting on -- having an interest rate view of businesses that are trading interest rates.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I got it. I appreciate that. And one more follow-up. Prior to the recent fed letters, there's a fed letter last month, and one of the things that it did was more aggressively stress card losses in the test, which I thought were already really aggressively stressed, but whatever. Curious if you have a view on how much worse that is, why they did that now. And does it have any impact on how you actually manage the business in real life? Are there particular types of business that get treated worse that you have to think about how you price?","John Gerspach","No. I'm trying to choose my words very carefully here, Glenn. But one of the issues, obviously, that I think there's been a lot of discussion about has been the lack of transparency in some of the fed models that drive CCAR, lack of transparency into how scenarios are developed. And so we don't have a great deal of understanding in how the fed comes up with some of their views, and so it's rather difficult then to say, \"Okay. I understand they have a particular view on a particular exposure. We need to rethink the entire business model around something,\" because those views from the fed change as well, so long answer. But the short answer is no, we're not going to change the way that we look at our cards book.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","I thought it was a very clean and straightforward quarter so appreciate that and appreciate the quick opening comments on such a busy day. If we look within ICG, the trends in Asia were quite strong, both in revenue and net income. And just wondered if you could elaborate on the revenue strength there in terms of some of the products and what drove that.","John Gerspach","No. As you note, Matt, we saw a lot of good activity coming out of Asia in this quarter. It's actually a build-on of things that we saw building from the second half of last year, and I think it speaks to a lot of the growing economies in Asia, a little bit more positive outlook. And fortunately, given the breadth of our franchise, we're in position to capture a lot of that. But it's fairly broad-based. It's in -- it's actually the Fixed Income business in Asia actually performed very well this quarter. Equities performed well this quarter. Investment Banking was down a little bit in Asia but a lot less than it was anywhere else, so just a lot of good overall volumes coming out of Asia.","Matthew O'Connor","And then just conceptually, I mean, how much of the franchise, when we look at these Asian revenues, are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below like more local companies?","John Gerspach","Well, most of our book is focused on serving the needs of the large multinationals. So that's one of the reasons why if you look at overall in the ICG, in our corporate lending book and the corporate exposures that we've given you, roughly 80% of that book is investment grade, and that's because it really is concentrated in those large multinationals because we service their subs in Asia and everything else. Now there's a growing cost rate of large local corporates that are also multinational. But still, our overall business is dominated by the large multinationals and their subs that are based in the U.S. and in Europe.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","One of the biggest questions I get on you guys surrounds the card -- U.S. card business and how to think about or size the TCA rate impact and how it can maybe rebound eventually in terms of conversion rates and with the size of the portfolio. I mean, we can maybe take an educated guess, but if there's any kind of help you can give us in trying to think through what -- how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond.","John Gerspach","Yes. And we've never talked specifics about the exact dollar amount on promotional balances that we've built up, and so I'm not going to go into that level of detail. But we have told you that it is -- it built up significantly last year, and our expectation is that it was going to stabilize at the beginning of this year and it has. And now it should continue then to reduce throughout the balance of 2018 and then into 2019. So we're never going to drive it to 0 because it certainly is an important piece of the growth strategy for the business, but it will get a little -- we acknowledge that it was a little outsized last year because we pulled back from trying to grow in the rewards product area and focused instead on the promo balances in value and whatnot. But we're already seeing the balances stabilize, and I think they're down slightly from the end of December to the end of March. But the thesis and our plan is to drive that even lower during the course of this year.","James Mitchell","And what's the sort of expected or what should have been your experience with sort of balances that convert to interest bearing, the rough kind of percentage? How should we think about that?","John Gerspach","Again, we've never disclosed an actual percentage, but I think if you think in terms of something a little less than half, you'd be in a good range.","James Mitchell","Okay. That's helpful. All right. And maybe just a question on equities trading. You obviously have very significant growth year-over-year. It seems mostly in the market-making components. I assume that's derivative. How much of that is just outside volatility this quarter? Or do you really think there's some sustainability in that growth?","John Gerspach","Well, I actually think it's a combination of both. The overall market conditions for Equities was very strong in the first quarter, and so we certainly benefited from that. But at the same time, we've been making the investments that we've been talking about, the investments, sustained investments in our platform, the talent, expanded capabilities in order to serve the needs of our clients and putting more balance sheet to work to deepen those relationships. And so I think our performance this quarter is a combination of both favorable market and the foundation that we built through all of that investment. So we feel really good about our performance. We think that it continues the trend of our ability to capture market share in this area. Whether you're dealing with unfavorable market conditions or favorable market conditions, we still feel like we're on that march up towards the #5 position in equity markets, which is something that we targeted getting to several years ago.","Michael Corbat","And what was nice about it is the breadth in terms of the combination of cash derivative, Delta One, Prime Finance all showing nice, sequential and year-over-year gain. So in there, I don't think we can or would annualize that number. We'd love to, but I don't think we're there yet. But I think we feel good about the progress and some of the stickiness that comes with that.","John Gerspach","Yes. Very good.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","If you could just give more information on the credit cards and the promotional balances, I guess I'll try again. You said a little less than half is what -- if you could just clarify what that referred to. And I thought the new data point, you said there's 6% growth in interest-earning balances, and I think that would compare to 4% growth in the fourth quarter. So you're seeing an acceleration in the growth of interest-earning credit card balances. Is that correct? And if so, is that because the promotions are sticking once they reprice from 0% to 14% to 24%? Or is that due to other reasons?","John Gerspach","Okay, Mike. If I miss one of the questions, please remind me what it was. But you're absolutely correct. 6% growth in the interest-earning balances this quarter compared to 4% last quarter, so that is an acceleration. And that's what we've been talking about, the fact that we did expect that growth rate to accelerate, and it has. And the acceleration of that growth rate is a combination, both of overall growth in the existing interest rate balances as well as the added growth coming from vintages of the promotional vintages now maturing and then a good portion of those promotional balances sticking with us as interest-earning balances. The reference prior to the 50% -- it's something in the range of a little less than 50% was an answer to -- I think it was Jim's question. As far as -- if you get promotional balances, how much of that do you think sticks with you? And we've never given an actual percentage, but I said, \"If you think of something a little less than 50%, you'd be in the right ballpark.\" How did I do?","Michael Mayo","No. I think that's helpful. I mean, I'm still -- look, I'm all on your website now, and I see I can basically get free money for 21 months by transferring a balance and then purchases up to 12 months. It sounds like a great deal for consumers. It's just hard for us in the outside to know how the deal is for you guys. And I guess one last follow-up then. So you're not giving us the total balance of the promotional balances on -- I'll take it if you could give it to us. But what else can you have us look to, to be reassured that this strategy is going to pay off for shareholders?","John Gerspach","Well, I think that, again, you're going to see, once we get past '18, we talked about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat. You should start to see growth in '19. More specifically, when you take a look at -- if you go into the supplement and you look at the net interest revenue percentage, ex Hilton, you can see how that has been steadily declining. And that obviously impacts a combination of the drag on promotional balances, along with the rise in interest rates, to fund that portfolio. Our expectation is that you got 1 more quarter of that to go down, and it's largely due to seasonality. The second quarter is usually a slight reduction there. But then you should start to see, beginning in the third quarter, that percentage increase. And that should give you a fairly good view as to what the future profitability of the business is. If you look at that now, basically I think if you look year-over-year, even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in U.S.-branded cards, ex Hilton, something north of 2%, 2.4%, 2.3%. And that, again, that's in line with what we talked about as far as being the underlying growth of that portfolio for this year being 2%.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","So you increased your expectation for core accrual NII to 2.7% from 2.5%, and I guess you're incorporating an additional rate hike. But can you just remind us if we do see 3% or 4% hikes, how much that -- how much you benefit from each incremental rate hike on a quarterly basis? Can you just remind us what the sensitivity is there?","John Gerspach","Yes. And it's very simple to do, Saul, because what we did was the March rate hike actually happened. We did not have that in our previous outlook, and we talk about that. And so our guidance had been that for each quarter, we get an additional 25 basis point rate hike, it should add about $80 million worth of net interest revenue for the year. So March happened, 3 quarters, 3 times $80 million, $240 million. So the 2.5% goes up to 2.7% and changed. We just rounded it to 2.7%. But technically, it will be 2.74%. And the math is as simple as that. Now that's certainly in place for the March rate hike, and that's the way we calculated the impact of the June rate hike. I do think that as we go forward with future rate hikes -- as you get more and more rate hikes, we'll probably see a bit of compression in that $80 million just because the expectation would be that deposit betas are increasing.","Saul Martinez","Right, right. Okay. No. That's fair enough. That's about as simple math as you can do. Great.","John Gerspach","Thank you. I'm...","Saul Martinez","There you go. It works. Simple is good. On the trading side, just obviously this -- the volatility early in the year has helped, especially in the Equities side. But generally, I think the perception is -- has been that it's a good thing. Obviously, March, maybe FICC was a little bit tougher. But how are you feeling? I know it's hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But how are you feeling about the business from here? You've had -- volatility has been good. But with the more recent market downturn, maybe institutional investors are heading for the sidelines a bit. But how are -- how should we be -- how are you thinking about FICC right now, the outlook there? And obviously in the Equities side, there's a build-out. But just generally, what are sort of the puts and takes around the businesses?","John Gerspach","Well, as far as from an Equities point of view, we certainly feel really good about the business that we're building in Equities. And so -- and I think this quarter's performance at least provides a point of evidence for it, although we were building up market share all during last year as well. But I think this is just another proof point. When it comes to FICC, it really is the investor that is a little bit of a variable there. And one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that investors, depending upon market conditions, are either in the market transacting or else, as you just said so, they sometimes drift to the sidelines. That's one of the reasons why we like the fact that in our rates and currencies business, in particular, 45% of the client revenues that we generate in that business are from corporate clients. And that gives us a fairly strong foundation in our rates and currency business because corporations need to fund their balance sheet every day, which means every day, you've got the ability to have a conversation with either a global treasurer or a local treasurer about what he or she needs to do in order to make payments, fund their working capital needs. And all of that helps to drive a lot of the activity in our rates and currencies business. So good core foundation, but it's the market volatility that ultimately will determine the size of the revenue flows that any institution is going to see in the FICC business.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And I guess just the final thing from there just building out. In IP, how are you thinking about the pipe -- what's the pipeline look like? What's -- how are you thinking -- how's the DCM, ECM, M&A? How are you thinking about the outlooks there?","Michael Corbat","Saul, I would say that the first quarter, we saw volumes down, and our drop in Investment Banking is pretty much right in line with what aggregate volumes were. But I would describe where we are today is not having hit the stop button but the pause button. And I think part of it is that I think we've seen some things on the approval, the regulatory, the legal side that have caused some of the big transactions to take pause. And I'd say the other piece right now, which we're actively involved in, is, in particular, in the U.S. in the C-suite, the introduction of tax reform has people thinking and rethinking strategy and appropriately so, right. We've taken traditionally a high global tax rate, made it a lower tax rate and rather than global being territorial. And so people are and appropriately so, and we're very involved in those conversations rethinking that. And so I would say the pipeline, as we go forward, we think, looks good. And we expect activity to pick back up.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","John, so I wanted to dig into some of the NII guidance that you have given. It sounds from what I could glean that given the growth that you're contemplating or anticipating within core accrual NII as well as the declines or more subdued revenues on the trading NII side as well as the legacy runoff book, it feels like, for the full year, we should see NII relatively flat. And I was just hoping you can affirm whether that's the right way to think about it. Or are there other factors that we need to consider?","John Gerspach","We told you that core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this quarter -- I mean, this year. I wish it was 1 quarter, this year. The legacy asset runoff is $500 million, so that's $2.2 billion. And trading will be, as we've said, a bit unpredictable. But it's hard to imagine that we're going to get $2 billion of runoff in trading near this year. It could happen, I guess, but that's not the way we're planning it.","Steven Chubak","Okay, understood. And, John, just wanted to dig into some of the efficiency comments you made with regards to some of your digital efforts within consumer. As we think about the long-term expense trajectory from here, I was just hoping you could shed some light on what you think is an achievable efficiency target for retail banking specifically. It's something that we hear from investors quite often, just given that your margins are well above some of your U.S. retail bank peers, whether you expect to see meaningful conversions there. And how should we think about the timing?","John Gerspach","Yes. I don't want to get into guidance for individual product lines within a business. At Investor Day last year, we gave you our targets for Citi overall, and I think we shared some targets for GCB as well as ICG. But as you can imagine there, there's a lot of tradeoffs to go on in between different subproducts in each of those businesses. And I really don't want to get into specific targets for specific products.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Fair enough. And just one more for me on the stressed capital buffer. You mentioned that you'd estimated an SCB of roughly 3%. I just wanted to clarify if that estimate is based on your 2017 results or is that more of an average over the last couple of years.","John Gerspach","No. That was based on 2017, Steve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Question just on LIBOR and the three months, 1 month base differential that happened this quarter. How did that impact you guys in the NIM?","John Gerspach","Very little. I mean, I wouldn't say none but it isn't a noticeable factor that we would point out for anything. It certainly -- we had very little impact on any of our funding schemes or on how the businesses had performed. So it's interesting to look at but it didn't really impact us at all.","Betsy Graseck","And on trading, same thing?","John Gerspach","Again, it's part of the conversation that you have with clients. It's a great thing. It's a great conversation starter, and so it can lead to a whole series of discussions as to how clients might be thinking about things or observations in the market. But for how it impacted our business in particular, no.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And then front-end skew of your rate sensitivity, I mean, that is LIBOR based and prime based. I'm assuming both, but it's just the basis that changed in the quarter didn't impact you. Is that correct?","John Gerspach","Yes. Look, everything balances out. I mean, we have a slight reduction, of course, in our forward-looking IRE as a result of some of these moves and putting more things to work in the business. But it didn't impact anything structurally, no.","Betsy Graseck","So then when I look at the core accrual NIM, the one on Page 10, the 3.54% this quarter, we can build off of that for the rest of the year, given the forward curve looking for a couple of more rate hikes?","John Gerspach","Yes. The expectation would be that we would continue to see some growth in that core NIM.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, great. And then just lastly, I know we had a lot of questions already on the ESLR. Your SLR is relatively high, and that's been high for a little while. Is it -- should we read anything into that? Like are you saying by having a relatively high SLR already that you've maxed out your opportunities on the lower risk-weighted asset business lines or maybe you have a different answer?","John Gerspach","Well, I guess, the answer would be SLR has never been a binding constraint for us. And so we've never really had to optimize the SLR. We've never had a problem in getting there. When you talk about lower risk-weighted assets as -- and now, we're moving much more to standardized approach, it's not a big -- there's not a larger gap between what you would think about as an advanced approach or really risk-based RWA and GAAP assets anymore. There's some but it's less so. So the SLR is interesting. We would applaud the increased flexibility that it can grant us but it never -- it really hasn't been something that has really impacted our overall business. What impacts us would be our focus on maintaining a 3% GSIB score and managing to that target of 11.5% CET1 ratio that we talked about. So I mean, SLR is somewhat of a fallout from those two efforts.","Betsy Graseck","And does it matter at all if the rules were to change to take cash out of the denominator? I know the proposal does not have that expected but there's a question in there looking for feedback on that topic. Would it matter to you if that was the case or not?","John Gerspach","Well, again, we're always going to applaud increased flexibility and applaud the application of logic to regulatory ratios. And why you would need to hold capital against cash, I still don't understand. So yes, I'd like to see that just because I think it's logical.","Michael Corbat","I don't think, John, it would change the business strategy.","John Gerspach","It wouldn't change our business strategy. Absolutely not.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Mike, in your opening comments, you made a good blend of thought across better, synchronized global growth and yet the volatility. And I just wanted to ask you, this comes up a lot with the investor community but tends to be more resilient in the business model. We've seen better results out of Asia and Latin America, especially in Consumer. How resilient is that improved growth and trajectory versus -- and what do you hear when you're talking to the regions about, perhaps, the jitters that get caused out of the volatility and how that might impact growth?","Michael Corbat","Well, when you think about Latin America or Asia and you look at what's going on in those economies, economies are, across the board, strong. We talked about this global synchronized growth, and when you're on the ground, you absolutely feel it. You feel it from the consumer perspective. You feel it at the corporate level. And I think some of the volatility that we see with morning tweaks or kind of stances that vary from time-to-time, I won't say the world is numb or numbing to that but I think that the positive things that are happening in the advancements we see on growth on the ground are overwhelming that. And that, to us, is very positive.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. As a follow-up to that, John, can you just talk to us broadly then also about your outlook for credit? I don't think you've changed anything with regard to your card outlook, like you mentioned in your prepared remarks but anything notable to see underneath the surface in terms of some of the -- a little moving parts on the consumer side, LatAm better and then the U.S. normalizing as we expected. But just your overall thoughts on cost of credit and forward expectation would be great.","John Gerspach","Yes, actually, we continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America businesses or in Mexico or in Asia when it comes to consumer. When you take a look at that slide, I think it's 7, and it's been pretty stable across the board. And as we look into the delinquencies, which we give you at least insight into the 90-day delinquencies, we don't see anything bumping up. So we feel pretty good about the credit picture across the consumer business. And in like fashion, we feel really good about the credit performance of our ICG portfolio as well. As I mentioned, 80% of our portfolio is investment-grade, and that's clearly the way that the ICG loan book has been performing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My questions have been asked and answered.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","You guys had some strong numbers in the Treasury and Trade Solutions on a year-over-year basis. It looked like you had up -- high single-digit revenue growth, and Securities Services was mid-teens. How much can you say was due to market share gains versus just a better interest rate environment for you guys?","John Gerspach","I don't want to split the revenue growth. Obviously, there's 3 aspects, I think, in that. And 1 is continued volume growth with existing clients. We're doing more with every client, so we're gaining wallet share with our existing clients. We're also gaining wallet share outside of the existing clients by bringing on new clients, and that certainly is a story in security services in particular but also in the commercial card aspect of TTS. And then the last would be the impact of rates but I just don't have a percentage in my head, Gerard. Is it 60-40? Is it 70-30? 50-50? I just can't give you that but it's -- all three components are working in those businesses.","Gerard Cassidy","I see. And we talk a lot about digitalization on the consumer side of the business. And you guys touched on what you're doing on your Investor Day with digitalization in this area. How important is that to maybe win new business as some of your competitors may not just be as good as you on the digitalization side?","Michael Corbat","Well, I think it's important on a couple of fronts, clearly, in terms of winning new customers. But as you think about the digital strategy here, we're really out trying to change three things, one, the way we acquire. If you actually look at our acquisitions over the last year or so, about 1\/3 of those are now coming through to us digitally. So the experience is better. And as we can get that hopefully through the straight-through processing, we've got the ability to take costs out. Second is around the way that we transact and interact with existing clients. So as an example, our efforts to radically reduce the number of paper statements that we're sending out on a monthly or on a regular basis, and we've shown a lot of progress there. And I think the third piece is really around the service.","And in 2017, we reduced volumes to call centers, we think, by about 12 million phone calls. We think we're on track to likely do that again this year. You can pretty quickly run the math between the cost of a analog phone call versus a digital engagement. When you go on, you look at our apps in terms of your ability to check your balances, to move moneys, to make payments and to do these things, those are 3 big drivers. And what John referenced before is what we laid out in the Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business. And going back to the earlier question, how -- what does this trajectory look and feel like and why should we believe that there's the potential of an acceleration into late '18, '19 and '20? And so we're all over this. We view it to be a competitive advantage. And as part of that, what John mentioned in terms of our push into national digital banking and using a lot of our existing technology to continue to lever our consumer platform.","John Gerspach","And Gerard, it's the same story on the corporate side. These digital capabilities, this -- expanding all the platforms, again, our strategy really gets to focusing on those large multinationals. So now, we've given those global treasurers, the regional treasurers, the ability to have a view into their working capital, not just in the regional office or the global office but in every operating subsidiary that they have around the world. And they're able then to manage their working capital, move funds off of their tablet. So they can sit in whatever city you want to pick, whether it's New York, London and Zurich or Beijing, and they can actually see on their tablet the working capital requirements in their international subsidiary and move funds through our application. We think that that's a real competitive advantage, especially as we're starting to see more and more company expand into more and more countries. That's the power of our network.","Gerard Cassidy","John, you didn't list Portland Maine as one of those cities.","John Gerspach","I thought about that, Gerard, but I wasn't sure if that's where you were today.","Gerard Cassidy","There you go. You guys are unique in your international business versus some of your peers. Is there any behavior differences between your international or non-U.S. consumer customers versus Americans on the digital usage or how they behave?","Michael Corbat","Yes, in some cases, very much so. So you can go look at smart devices, you can look at digital engagement. As you can imagine, Asia is really at the forefront on a lot of things we're doing in terms of digital engagement, united transactions and things coming through and things we're putting in place. And while moving and moving at a reasonable pace, you can simply walk into one of our branches in Mexico and recognize that Mexico is still predominantly a physical or an analog experience for our customers but changing and evolving. And again, what we like is we got the technology elsewhere in the world that we can continue to roll out. We don't have to invent it from Mexico. It exists. And I would just say that the world is at varying stages of digital engagement but all headed in the same direction.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just lastly. Mike, you touched about the breadth of the equity trading revenues being in cash and prime brokerage, et cetera. Have you guys seen any impact yet from the MiFID rules that went into effect? I know it is early but any early read on that yet?","Michael Corbat","So we've obviously been engaged and been working with our clients towards making sure everybody is MiFID-compliant. I would say, those -- from our perspective, we believe those conversations have been very constructive, and the conversations we've been involved in are largely holistic approaches to what we're going to provide. And I would say the engagement has been good. And then I would describe today that we haven't had any surprises to the negative in any material way to how we thought this would roll out.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Alevizos Alevizakos","You've done a very good analysis to explain to us how the business is working with -- effectively with transaction banking working with your FX and rates business and the importance of your corporate clients. However, I would like to know your view about how you're feeling regarding the macro environment, especially regarding trade finals. Given all the news flow that we see everywhere regarding tariffs and all these kind of things that are happening with China and Russia, would it be possible to somehow quantify any potential downside for us?","Michael Corbat","Sure, sure. So one is, when you look at -- coming out of 2017 and some of the numbers that were published, and I think it was the IMF published a report in January that talks about the 175 countries that they track, somewhere in the magnitude of 150 or 155 of those countries actually grew exports year-over-year, the largest number that I could remember on history. And so trade is alive. Trade is well. So that's kind of piece one as we come into '18. Piece two is when you think about the distribution of trade, while 80% of global trade is denominated in dollars, about 20% of global trade affects the U.S. And so as we think about our business, our businesses is, I think, very representative of global trade in that about 20% of our trade business is U.S.-related. And therefore, 80% is rest of world. So from our perspective and the diversification that we have, for us, it's not necessarily a question of who's trading it but is it trading and is it moving.","And I think as we've done our analysis, at least as it pertains to us, the impact of a U.S.-China trade war is probably a bigger macro event than it is a Citi-specific trade event, meaning that I'm just hard-pressed to believe that if you've got 2 of the book ends of the global economy that the world is counting on for growth, and you've got a trade war going that growth is likely to suffer, and that's likely to have a spillover to the rest of the economy, seems -- as of today and as of recent conversations that -- from what, I'm sure, we're all reading that things have deescalated a bit there and seem to be headed in a more positive direction. But I think it's in everyone's best interest to try and avoid a trade war, if we can.","Alevizos Alevizakos","Sure. And if I may follow up on Gerard's question regarding MiFID II. You already mentioned that Asia Pacific equities were very strong. How was Europe, especially in cash and deliveries?","Michael Corbat","It was good. It was also strong. And again, I think, from a -- again, I talked a little bit about the product, the underlying mix between cash, derivative, et cetera. But as we look at North America, we look at EMEA and we look at Asia, again, good, balanced participation in that growth.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just had one quick question. On the credit cost, you said you're expecting them to tick up from here. But I want to make sure there was no change in your credit card NCL guidance, you're still comfortable with 2018 and medium-term targets that you laid out previously?","John Gerspach","Yes.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then a separate question. There seem to be a lot of concerns about deposit costs and where they're going from here. I mean, your deposit costs were only up 8 basis points quarter-on-quarter but are you seeing something different in the market over the last month or two that makes you concerned as well that there's isn't a more meaningful inflection in deposit costs? Are you starting to see irrational pricing in the market, perhaps, or deposits moving faster, deposit gambles, I guess, going up or something else in the market that we're not seeing in the numbers that you reported?","John Gerspach","No. The way I would characterize it, Brian, is, I think, at least from our view, our deposit betas are, by and large, operating exactly as we had modeled them to this point. I do think that -- and this may be what you're hearing, as we continue to get rate increases, as the rate increases -- increase also in frequency, you're going to start to see some pressure on those deposit betas. It's just inevitable, and it's going to happen. Hasn't happened yet but I think we're all seeing pretty much the same thing, that the betas will move up. Now the betas moving up is all part of our forward projections, and so it's not a surprise to us but it's just something that you have to expect to happen.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Was the deposit beta this quarter below still what you were expecting?","John Gerspach","Mixed. No, I'd say corporate betas have moved up certainly more than consumer betas. And that's been consistent, at least in the last year. So you do have a mixed component in beta. Not every beta is the same.

At which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.","Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.5 billion for the second quarter of 2018 or $1.63 per share. Our earnings per share were 27% higher than a year ago, as a result of improved business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding.","Our EBIT was up 5%, as a result of revenue growth in both sides of the house, combined with continued expense and credit discipline. Loans and deposits increased 5% and 4%, respectively.","Our efficiency ratio was 58%, 130 basis points better than a year ago. Our return on assets was 94 basis points, an 11 basis points higher than a year ago and our return on tangible common equity improved to 10.8%, 300 basis points higher than a year ago.","Global Consumer Banking had 3% revenue growth, including 6% internationally and Latin America revenue increased 11%. While underlying growth in Asia was 4%, in line with our medium-term expectations.","In the U.S., we continued to grow our retail banking business and we closed the acquisition of the L.L. Bean portfolio in retail services and in U.S. Branded Cards, we saw strong interest earning balance growth as our investments continue to mature.","Our Institutional Clients Group also grew revenues by 3%. While Fixed Income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across the board, especially Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending, and the Private Bank. Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting.","Taking a step back for a moment, was almost a year ago since we brought you all together to lay out our 2020 targets, so I think this morning is a good opportunity to recap some of the progress we\u2019ve made since Investor Day. As you may recall, at the time, I spoke about three strategic priorities we would pursue to reach those financial targets.","First, was to deliver sustainable client led growth, by deepening our relationships with existing clients and reaching new clients within our targeted segments. Next, was to leverage our scale and investments in technology to enhance the client experience and improve our operating efficiency. And third, was to optimize our capital base and return all the capital above the amount needed to prudently operate and invest in our franchise.","In terms of the first, you can see in our results over the past 12 months that we\u2019ve continued to grow revenue and deepen client relationships across our franchise. We expected that in some cases we would outperform and in others we could underperform those growth expectations, but on balance, we\u2019re performing close to our medium-term goals. And importantly, much of that growth is being generated in stable accrual businesses in consumer and in areas like TTS, security services and the Private Bank.","And we\u2019ve had good success in many areas where we\u2019ve been investing. Earlier I mentioned equities for last quarter we ranked sixth, just outside of our top-five target. In consumer, our Wealth Management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S.","Internationally, Mexico is starting to see the revenue levels we\u2019ve forecasted, as we execute our investment plan there and our Asia franchise continues to grow. Clearly, U.S. Branded Cards should face headwinds, but we\u2019re seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward.","On the second priority, we\u2019ve continued to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth, while self funding these investments through efficiency savings. We\u2019re focused on transforming the client experience across our franchise, driving digital solutions for both our consumer and institutional clients, while lowering our costs through automation or other service improvements.","These efforts are leading to lower call volumes per account and higher digital engagement by our clients. And overall, we\u2019ve improved our operating efficiency year-over-year for seven straight quarters and we\u2019re on track to reach the low 50s by 2020.","The third priority is capital return. Last July we committed to return at least $60 billion through dividends and buybacks over three CCAR cycles, of course subject to regulatory approval. For the first cycle, we returned $19 billion of capital and just last month we got approval for the second tranche, a return of $22 billion, including an increase in our dividend to $0.45 per quarter. So our capital planning has been effective, reducing our common shares outstanding by over 200 million over the past year to just over 2.5 billion shares, which helped drive our EPS up by 20%.","So, one year in, I have to say that, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made for the first half of 2018. Our return on tangible common equity was just over 11% and we expect to remain ahead of our 10.5% target for the full year. We are on track to bring our efficiency ratio down to roughly 57% with a return on assets above 90 basis points.","With that, John, will go through the presentation and then we would be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three. Net income of $4.5 billion in the second quarter was 16% from last year. As growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.","EPS grew 27%, including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues and expenses were flat, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.","Our efficiency ratio was 58% for the quarter, over 100 basis points better than last year, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency improvement. And cost of credit increased 6% driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer.","In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $671 billion. GCB and ICG loans grew by $40 billion in total, with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending.","Now looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage, with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio. EPS grew by 26%, including the benefit of share buybacks, as well as a lower effective tax rate. Our return on assets was 96 basis points and our RoTCE was just over 11%, positioning us well to exceed our target of 10.5% for full year 2018.","Now, before we go into the second quarter in more detail, let me build on some of the comments Mike made earlier on our progress since Investor Day on slide four. We remained committed to improving RoTCE through a combination of client-led revenue growth, expense discipline and significant capital return.","As we\u2019ve noted before, our plan is balanced across regions and businesses, with no outsized reliance on macro drivers, including interest rates, and we believe our results over the last 12 months represents solid progress. As you would expect, certain businesses have outpaced our medium-term growth expectations, while others have lacked, but on balance we generated roughly 4% growth in our core businesses.","In consumer, revenues are up 4% in constant dollars, slightly below our 5% medium-term goal. In North America, our retail banking and retail services businesses are broadly on pace and while U.S. Branded Cards has grown 1%, we are seeing underlying improvements in 2018 that gives us confidence in a stronger trajectory going forward.","In Asia, we outperformed our 4% medium-term growth target, driven by strength in Wealth Management revenues. And while Mexico was somewhat below its 10% target, we\u2019ve seen an improving growth trend over the past few quarters.","In our Institutional business, we\u2019re broadly tracking to our 4% medium-term growth target. Fixed Income markets have been challenging, but we\u2019ve offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services and we\u2019re also seeing significant growth in equities.","We\u2019ve ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client led growth, but over the past year, we\u2019ve been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total.","Credit costs have increased, but we remain well within our medium-term loss rate guidance and credit quality remains broadly stable across the franchise. Over the past year, we repurchased roughly 8% of our shares outstanding, contributing to EPS growth of 20% and our total capital return increased by over 50% to roughly $19 billion.","As Mike noted earlier, we recently announced plans to return an additional $22 billion in dividends and buybacks over the next 12 months. Now we recognized there is significant work yet to do, but we believe we are solidly on track to achieve our targets and I\u2019ll speak more about our outlook in a moment.","Turning now to the second quarter. Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 15% in the second quarter, driven by operating margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a higher cost of credit. Total revenues of $8.3 billion grew 3% year-over-year, with contribution from every region and product.","Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards revenues were up 1%.","Slide six, shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $5 billion were up 1% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 4% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continue to decline mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise.","Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 9%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and increased commercial banking activity. Average deposits declined 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments.","In keeping with this focus on Wealth Management, assets under management were up 8% year-over-year to $61 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold, with households up over 20% year-over-year and we\u2019re continuing to drive toward the next stage of our transformation by starting to rollout national digital banking.","We launched the first set of foundational features in May on our mobile app, including the ability for retail banking clients to view and analyze their full financial position across firms. The next step will be to rollout enhance deposit taking capabilities through both online and mobile channels over the coming months, along with the broader marketing campaign. This is just the start of a wider launch across the full spectrum of deposit taking, borrowing and advisory services with the goal of building a full-service relationships through these digital channels.","Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 1% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. Excluding Hilton, Branded Card revenues were up 1%, with underlying revenue growth of 2% being offset by the impact of previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.","In addition, during the second quarter we recorded a gain of roughly $45 million in Branded Cards related to the sale of Visa B shares. However, this gain was partially offset in the second quarter by the impact of repricing actions on a small portion of our card accounts related to the previously disclosed issues with APR rate re-evaluation under the CARD Act. For the full year, we expect the impact of these repricing actions to be roughly $50 million. So together, the Visa B game and the repricing actions are neutral to revenues in 2018.","In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues excluding Hilton to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis, with around 2% underlying growth, driven by continued strong client engagement, loan growth and improved mix. This is similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 5%, including 6% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continue to mature.","Our net interest revenue percentage declined sequentially as expected, but we continue to expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter. This improvement should continue into the fourth quarter and then translate into a year-over-year increase in the NIR percentage in 2019.","As the mix of interest-earning balances continues to improve, we believe our underlying growth will accelerate in 2019, resulting in modest reported growth next year, even considering the Hilton and Visa B games we took in 2018.","Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by higher average loans. This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L. Bean card portfolio, which added $1.5 billion of high quality receivables at quarter end.","Total expenses for North America consumer were up 3%, including a provision of approximately $50 million for an industry-wide legal matter. Excluding the impact of this provision, expenses were up 1% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.","Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year and we billed roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 507 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018.","On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Second quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 6% with contribution from both regions. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 11%. Retail banking revenues grew 12% in the second quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits. And card revenues grew 9% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year. Retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued strength in Wealth Management, despite a sequential slowdown in investment revenues and excluding the one-time gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.","In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending and volumes driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 11%, reflecting loan growth, as well as a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period.","Slide eight shows the global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine. Revenues of $9.7 billion increased 3% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses, along with a strong performance in equity this quarter.","Total Banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 6%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior-year comparison in debt underwriting.","Private Bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $589 million were up 22% reflecting loan growth, as well as lower hedging costs.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were down 1% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.1 billion declined 6% year-over-year, reflecting a more challenging market environment, as well as the comparison to a strong prior year period in G10 rates and securitized products. We continue to see strong corporate client activity this quarter in particular in G10 FX and local markets.","Equities revenues were up 19%, with growth across all products, reflecting the benefit of continued higher market volatility, as well as continued momentum with investor clients in line with our investment strategy. And finally, in Security Services revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.","Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes, along with higher levels of investments spending, partially offset by productivity savings. And finally, cost of credit remains benign this quarter.","Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $528 million declined 20% from last year, driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 40%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower legal and infrastructure costs. And pretax income was $47 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting recoveries and cost of credit related to the sale of legacy mortgage assets, as well as lower legal expenses.","Looking ahead, we believe an outlook for pretax losses in the range of around $100 million per quarter to $150 million per quarter in Corp\/Other is a fair run rate for the remainder of 2018. This is a further improvement from our prior outlook, based on higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment, as well as continued lower infrastructure expenses.","Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 12% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other.","Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1 billion year-over-year and our core accrual net interest margin improved by 13 basis points to 360 basis points driven by rate increases, loan growth and an improved loan mix versus last year.","On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $550 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter and our core accrual net interest margin also improved by 6 basis points, primarily reflecting higher rates.","Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are updating our prior outlook for growth in core accrual net interest revenue from roughly $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion for full year 2018, reflecting loan growth, improved mix and lower than expected retail deposits sensitivity in the first half of the year, as well as an additional rate hike in September that had not been included in our original outlook.","In the first half of 2018, our core accrual net interest revenue grew by nearly $1.8 billion year-over-year. So this implies second half growth should come in just slightly lower than that. Although, the retail deposit betas have run lower than anticipated so far this year, we do expect higher sensitivity going forward, which is reflected in our outlook.","Finally, we continue to expect legacy asset related net interest revenues to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio. And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters.","On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio remain roughly flat sequentially at 12.1% this quarter, as net income was offset by $3.1 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, and our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.29.","Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook. For the third quarter in ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment. However, we would typically expect seasonally slower activity versus the second quarter.","We expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network. And keep in mind, on a year-over-year basis, we will be comparing to the third quarter last year that included a gain of roughly $580 million on the sale of yield book of Fixed Income analytics business.","In Consumer, in North America we should see continued progress in retail banking and retail services, including a full quarter contribution from L.L. Bean. U.S. Branded Cards growth will continue to be impacted by the Hilton sale on a year-over-year basis. However, we do expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter as our loan mix continues to improve.","We expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico. And additionally, we expect to generate a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Asset Management business in Mexico this quarter.","Total Citigroup expenses should continue to decline sequentially as you saw the second quarter. Cost of credit should increase, reflecting normalization in ICG and Corp\/Other, and the tax rate should be just under 25%.","Now taking a broader look at revenue and efficiency trends for the second half of 2018, we expect total revenue growth to come in slightly higher than the 2% year-over-year growth we saw in the first half of the year.","Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, and this should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year. We think about our expense base in a few components as we described at Investor Day last year.","First, there are volume related expenses that will grow over time as we extend our franchise.","Second, are the incremental investments we\u2019re making to both deepen our client relationships and improve the efficiency of our operations. We estimated these incremental investments at roughly $1.5 billion by full year 2020.","Third, are the efficiency savings we expect to realize in order to offset these volume-related costs and investments. These we estimated at roughly $2.5 billion by 2020.","And then, finally, we have expenses related to legacy assets which are shrinking over time. If we look at what we\u2019ve achieved so far over the past year, we\u2019ve deployed nearly half of the $1.5 billion of incremental investments, with a somewhat heavier emphasis in consumer initially and now across both consumer and ICG, and at the same time, we\u2019ve only realized roughly a third of the estimated $2.5 billion of efficiency savings.","If you do the math, you\u2019ll see that the incremental investments were funded through efficiency savings over the past year, while other volume driven expenses were essentially offset through the wind down of legacy assets.","So we\u2019re not yet at a point where the efficiency savings are outpacing the incremental investment spend but that should change as we go forward. In fact as we\u2019ve gotten better line of sight into the $2.5 billion of efficiency savings, we believe there could be upside to that figure. This would give us the flexibility to invest more into the franchise or we could also let those benefits drop to the bottomline depending on the environment.","If you look at the existing $2.5 billion of planned savings, the largest component is in Consumer with $1.5 billion of efficiency benefits. As you would expect many of those benefits are driven by our digital transformation.","First is, how we\u2019re using digital to engage with our clients shifting consumer activity to more convenient and efficient channels.","Second, is how we\u2019re using technology to streamline our own operations, things like straight through application processing, the use of big data and branch optimization.","And third, a portion of the savings should come from more conventional initiatives. For example, using lower cost locations, improving procurement and process reengineering.","The second and third buckets, which are largely in our control and do not rely on changes in consumer behavior comprise over three quarters of the planned efficiency savings. And on the portion that is tied to client engagement, we are seeing good progress.","Digital and mobile usage is up across all regions, E-Statement and E-Payment penetration rates are rising. Agent handled call volume per account is continuing to decline and this is contributing to a continued decline in operations cost per account.","So while there is a lot of work still to be done, we have a good line of sight into our efficiency drivers both in consumer and across the franchise. We remain confident in our ability to drive an improvement in Citigroup operating efficiency of roughly 100 basis points in 2018 and then a further 400 basis points improvement by 2020 in line with our goal of reaching the low 50% range.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. So in ICG Corporate Lending, the rev is up 22% as you pointed out. I\u2019m curious the combination of, A, biggest drivers of that loan growth and if you think that actually proves as all the tax regime filters through? And B, the other part of your comment what helped that was lower hedging costs and I thought that was a little curious in a world where rates are rising, so one mathematical and one more related to growth?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. The lower hedging costs, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve actually talked about, I think, for the last several quarters, that it\u2019s a combination of two things, Glenn. Some of it is we\u2019ve reduced the actual amount of hedges that we have put on.","And if you think about some of the things that have happened in the past year, the energy sector for instance has stabilized and so that\u2019s an area where we have been able to lower some of our hedging exposure. And then, additionally, we\u2019ve also, I think, put in some more effective hedging strategies and so those two combine for the benefit that we\u2019ve gotten in the hedging costs.","As far as the overall growth in the Corporate Lending, I think, it is pretty widespread. If you look in the back of the deck somewhere around slide 23, 24, how about 24, you see the growth in end of period loans it\u2019s pretty widespread across regions with the exception of Latin America.","And Latin America has been hit a little bit by the slowdown in Brazil otherwise there is still good volume growth elsewhere. But you can see year-over-year 9% growth in North America, 16% growth in EMEA, 8% growth in Asia and on a linked quarter basis we\u2019ve got still some decent growth coming out of the North America and EMEA.","And if you go into the supplement, we give you the breakdown of the loan growth by product for ICG. And you can see it\u2019s all those things that I talked about on those comments, it\u2019s TTS, it\u2019s Traditional Corporate Lending. So it\u2019s pretty widespread.","Glenn Schorr","Awesome. One more growth question if I could, this one in North American cards.","Mike Corbat","Yeah.","Glenn Schorr","Curious if there are one or two products that you\u2019re most confident and that\u2019s going to drive that pick up in the second half and 2019?","John Gerspach","Well, the pickup, Glenn, it\u2019s driving from two broad themes that we talked about I think last time. One is, we\u2019ve started to see -- we expect to continue to see with [one-off] [ph] in promotional balance. We\u2019ve adjusted some of those terms that we had on the cards last year and we\u2019ve reduced the overall volume of new promotional activity that we\u2019ve had.","So, we\u2019ve got a very good line of sight to the reductions in the promotional balances. So, those are, obviously, accounts that cost us money, right. I mean we don\u2019t earn anything on a promo balance and I\u2019ve got to fund it.","At the same point in time, we continue to see those promotional balances transition into full revolving balances at just about the rates that we\u2019ve been modeling. The flipping rate, I think, I get asked the question last quarter on what\u2019s the rate of conversion, and I said, it was just under 50%. And that rate has held, it\u2019s actually inched up just a wee bit. But I\u2019d still say it\u2019s just below 50%. So, we\u2019re getting the good conversion activity as promotional balances run-off and they flip into full rate revolving balances. That\u2019s one of the reasons why full rate revolving balances have grown 6% year-over-year.","So, again, we feel very good about those underlying metrics in U.S. Branded Cards. We\u2019ll see that change now, that change in trajectory in net interest revenue percentage. It\u2019s been declining fairly steadily for a couple of years now and this should be the bottom quarter.","Next quarter the expectation is that net interest revenue percentage increases and then it increases again in the fourth quarter. And what we should see is in 2019 on a full year basis, the net interest revenue percentage should be higher than the overall net interest revenue percentage that we had in 2018.","Glenn Schorr","Awesome. Thanks, John.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, John. Thanks for the comments.","John Gerspach","Hi, John.","John McDonald","Yeah. Thanks for the comments about the trajectory of your investment spend versus the cost saves that was helpful to thinking about your path of efficiency improvement. I just want to reiterate based on the targets and the pickup and saves you\u2019re expecting, this year you\u2019re kind of running at a pace for about 100 basis point efficiency improvement, and it sounds like that\u2019s going to accelerate next year to kind of a 200 basis point improvement pace starting next year I guess.","John Gerspach","I would put it this way, John. Absolutely 100 basis point improvement. That\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting from this year and with that confidence in our ability to hit that. The next 400 basis points, whether it comes in 200 basis points, 200 basis points, 180 basis points, 220 basis points, I don\u2019t want to get too specific about that. We\u2019ll have more to say on that as we get closer to the year and we\u2019ll take a look at the budgeting. But, yeah, it will be 400 basis points of improvement over the next two years and we will get to a low 50s operating efficiency in 2020.","John McDonald","Got you. Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the global consumer. Asia consumer growth decelerated somewhat this quarter from a 7% pace to something like more like 4%. I\u2019m sorry, if I missed, if there\u2019s some special item there, but what drove that deceleration there?","John Gerspach","Client activity was fine, there was a little bit of a slowdown in investment activity. I think, I mentioned that in the commentary. That\u2019s somewhat of a sequential thing you get from the first quarter to second quarter. And there was also there was a couple small non-recurring items that occurred in the first quarter. Nothing big enough to call out, but again just a little bit of noise as you go through the sequential comparison.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just the opposite trend, Latin America accelerated to the 11% kind of in line with what you\u2019ve been targeting for Mexico for the Investor Day targets. Is that a pace that you can maintain going forward or are there some factors that we should keep in mind that were special this quarter?","John Gerspach","Yeah. Whoa there, big guy, all right. I would never want to point to 11% is being a sustainable trend, but -- because every quarter we have got one or two little things in it. But what we do like is the fact that if you take a look over the last four quarters that rate of growth has been accelerated.","I think we were at 4% rate of growth four quarters ago, then we went to 6%, then last quarter was either 8% or 9%, now we\u2019re up to 11%. And that really -- what we\u2019re thrilled with is the fact that the underlying drivers are there.","Take a look at the cards business, all last year we were talking to you about the fact that the cards business was now just beginning to lap some of the restructuring efforts, the repositioning efforts that we had in place and now you\u2019re seeing that really hit it\u2019s pace. So, I don\u2019t want you to think that 11% is going to be every quarter, but again over the next two and half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day.","John McDonald","Got it. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Maybe just a follow up on sort of the growth in outside the U.S. It\u2019s obviously been ticking up, but I think investors are pretty concerned about what we\u2019ve seen lately in terms of emerging market or at least equity markets and tariffs and NAFTA. How do we think about, I guess, the risk to the improving story, how do you guys -- how can you frame it for us to feel more comfortable that these businesses are pretty sustainable in some of these headwinds?","John Gerspach","Well, Jim, first I would say that, when we look at the trade rhetoric, it certainly introduced volatility, but we haven\u2019t yet really started to see any significant changes in behavior. Second piece is, when you think about where and with whom we operate in emerging markets, we\u2019re operating there typically with the multinationals. And the multinationals take a pretty consistent long-term approach to their business.","Our relationships are broad and in here if you kind of play this out to a certain end, supply chains or trade routes may realign, but they don\u2019t go away and with the network we have we\u2019re simply going to be leading and realigning with them to be partnering in terms of what they choose to do if it\u2019s different from what it is today.","So, we haven\u2019t seen changes in behavior of any significance. And so, no, right now it\u2019s the rhetoric we\u2019re tracking. I think the markets have the fears of what that rhetoric leads to. But at this point we\u2019re not seeing it coming through in the numbers.","James Mitchell","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe you talked about expenses to come actually a little bit ahead of expectations on the consumer side might give you some flexibility to invest more or let some flow to bottomline. But how do we think about where those incremental investments could go, would it be more to accelerate efficiency saves, potentially, let\u2019s say, in the Institutional side or would it be more for revenue growth drive -- driven those investments or a combination of both? How do we think about where that incremental savings could go?","John Gerspach","Jim, one of the things, we haven\u2019t decided what to do with those incremental dollars as yet. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ll get more into as we get into the fall and our traditional budget making. And we\u2019ll have more to say on all of that as we get into the fall maybe around the next earnings call.","But I think we would look at a combination of both revenue growth investments and continued efficiency. And some of these things, it would be advancing investments that maybe would have been in our mind something that we would have done in \u201821 or even \u201822, and just bring those things forward.","So, we haven\u2019t made any decisions yet. But I think the important thing from an investor point of view is the understanding that the $2.5 billion is going to be higher.","Jim Mitchell","Right.","John Gerspach","We\u2019re not struggling to get to the $2.5 billion.","Jim Mitchell","Right. No. That\u2019s fair. Just wanted to see if you had any kind of at least some examples of what you think you could accelerate some of those 2021 type investments what some of those areas could be.","John Gerspach","And my view that, if I start giving\u2026","Jim Mitchell","I want to share, yeah, that\u2019s fine.","John Gerspach","No, no, it\u2019s worse than that, if I start giving you examples, any example I give is going to be linked to a business guy and the first thing he is going to do is make beeline to my office and say. So then I can increase my budget.","Jim Mitchell","Yeah.","John Gerspach","So, no, not yet, we\u2019re still going to be making those decisions.","Jim Mitchell","All right. fair enough. Thanks.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Hi.","Mike Corbat","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I had a question on the efficiency. You talk about the full year improvement in 2018 of about 100 basis points I think you\u2019re running about 133 basis points so far. And I guess as I look to back half of the year I would have thought there might be opportunity to expand on that. I think the second half revenue comps are hopefully relatively easy and its sounds like you\u2019re pretty confident on the expense side. So just want to push a little bit on the second half efficiency guide?","John Gerspach","Yeah. But don\u2019t forget we do have a little bit of a tough comp, I mentioned it in the outlook, anything that we compare to, we did have that $580 million gain last year on that Fixed Income analytics business yield book. So that goes away as far as from a year-over-year comp and also while we continue to benefit from the wind down and legacy assets that does tend to abate, right, I mean, the expenses as they run-off, there is less of them to run-off.","So we\u2019re confident in that 100 basis point improvement. But I certainly would didn\u2019t want to commit to anything more than that just now obviously. We\u2019ll give you more update as we get it, but we\u2019re confident in that 100 basis points.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Got it. And then just change in directions within U.S. card, I think you\u2019ve announced that you\u2019ve changed or eliminated the promotional pricing with the Costco portfolio, I think the Citi Branded effort on the promotional pricing balance transfers it is still out there and continues to be pretty aggressive, any thoughts on tweaking that to not be as generous?","Mike Corbat","We have plans in place to tweak all of our offers, you can think about as we got a rollout schedule, a rollout schedule in mind. We don\u2019t want to completely take some of the juice for future revenue growth off the table. So we take a certain action, there\u2019s certain other actions that we got planned, all of that is embedded in that outlook that I\u2019ve given you.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. I mean, I guess, a bigger picture question is, you\u2019ve clearly made a lot of investments in card over the years. I think several years ago you improved kind of the customer service, some of the systems. Now you\u2019ve been ramping up on some of the offerings and it\u2019s gotten very competitive I think in terms of what you are providing to customers. But it feels like there should be some bigger payback at some point beyond just 1% or 2% revenue growth. So I don\u2019t know if you kind of look out beyond next year if you see a more material acceleration or if you can just talk to that kind of conceptually of all the efforts in card. When do you get more robust revenue growth out of this?","Mike Corbat","I think you just can\u2019t look at the revenue side of things. You need to look at the expense side, because again a lot of the investments we\u2019re making are in this transformation from what has historically largely been an analog business to a digital platform. And obviously we\u2019re in the stages of making those investments and in many cases running new and parallel processes. So actually incurring the expense of both.","And as John mentioned, and I mentioned in my preamble, we\u2019ve had very good success at reducing the calls per account and transforming those into digital interactions, which generate significant savings. That\u2019s the upticks we think have been strong and it\u2019s accelerating and we think that continues to accelerate and then over time we get to pullout the analog and largely run on the back of the digital platforms that we built and that should manifest itself largely in the expense line.","John Gerspach","And Matt, if you go back to Investor Day, we had targeted Branded Cards for a CAGR of 3%. And so that\u2019s still, when we get comfortable with the fact that we can either beat that 3% then we can start talking about a little bit of upside. But, again, we do like what we\u2019re seeing right now in those underlying drivers.","And it certainly has given us the confidence in the fact that this is a business that this year flat revenues with a 2% underlying growth. And next year we should be able to see a 2% -- it\u2019s something around maybe a 2% growth overall even with the grow-over that we got to do in -- with Hilton and the Visa B gain.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.","Mike Mayo","Well, this might be a record for the number of questions on efficiency, but I\u2019ll try again. Can you hear me?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. Very much, Mike.","Mike Mayo","I\u2019m just going to repeat what I think I heard you say. So you expect expenses to be down sequentially in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And you expect to have savings above the $2.5 billion. On the revenue side, you said revenue growth should accelerate on year-over-year comparison for the third quarter and fourth quarter and NIR should be higher from $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion, is that correct?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. Obviously, the NIR is part of the accelerating revenue growth and the $2.5 billion of savings is not a 2018 -- it\u2019s the $2.5 billion of savings that we said that we would get from 2018 through 2020. So you got all the fact. I just want to make sure that you are linking them properly.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So why not more than 100 basis points of efficiency savings this year? Why not more than, say, 200 basis points of savings next year. I guess that\u2019s for you. But, then, Mike, a bigger picture, where is Citigroup between investing and harvesting? Of course, you\u2019re always investing in your business, but you had a lot of frontloaded investments and a lot of times the consensus estimates wind up having efficiency going a lot lower than, you say, well, we have to invest more in Mexico or we have to invest more in Credit Card. We have to invest more in something else maybe its digital banking now. So are there any other major investments like that that could come our way where we, say, well, that efficiency progress might be delayed for what we said. So, the big picture about investing versus harvesting and then the specifics why can\u2019t you have more than 100 basis points of efficiency saves this year?","Mike Corbat","Well, I start with the first part. So, one, I think we\u2019ve been very, very transparent in terms of the investments that we\u2019ve been making and where we\u2019ve been making and I think laid, as John talked about, in the consumer business the saves in the investments there.","So I don\u2019t think there is anything we\u2019re going to surprise you with in terms of new investments. I would leave on the table where the opportunities present themselves to actually pull some investments forward where we think the paybacks are strong.","So we\u2019re in there, so as John said, when we get into budget we\u2019re going to be looking at opportunities that we have in the firm of where we can make investments and get some strong near-term savings and paybacks, and that\u2019s why at this point, we really don\u2019t want to commit to exactly how the 400 breaks between \u201819 and \u201820, because we may have some things that we can pull forward that are actually cost us a little bit in \u201819, but have the ability to pay back in \u201820. So, but nothing is going to change us getting to the low 50s by 2020.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And the digital banking effort does that involve a large incremental spend?","Mike Corbat","There is two aspects to the spend Mike both of which are embedded in the investment dollars that we\u2019ve been talking about. One is, there is obviously some level of technology development, as you\u2019re developing new features and functions on the apps and you are introducing those things. And the second would be a marketing campaign to make sure then that customers are aware of the capabilities that you have and have those capabilities can help solve their needs.","So, there -- I would say, there\u2019s two elements of that spend, both elements are in $2.5 billion, both elements are is the 100 basis points of improvement for this year, both elements are in the path towards getting to the low 50% efficiency ratio by 2020.","Mike Mayo","Got it. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Mike Corbat","Hi.","Betsy Graseck","I had a little more recent question, but just on the NII uptick and strength in NIM this quarter, could you just give us a sense of to -- ","John Gerspach","You\u2019re sure that do you want to ask something about operating efficiency? It seems to be the topic this year.","Betsy Graseck","No. You want one on that?","John Gerspach","No, no. I\u2019ll take the -- I\u2019ll take net interest this morning, please.","Betsy Graseck","I am just revs here. So, you had a nice pick up rate in NIM this quarter\u2026","John Gerspach","Yeah.","Betsy Graseck","\u2026 first time in a while. So I just wanted to get a sense as to why we should expect that that\u2019s going to be sustainable and in particular could you speak a little bit to the NII lift that you had in the institutional segment as well, because it was, obviously, 2% year-on-year, but 12% Q-on-Q, so wanted to understand what\u2019s going on there?","John Gerspach","Yeah. Betsy, maybe the best thing -- if you look at slide 11 that we have give you.","Betsy Graseck","Yeah.","John Gerspach","On the net interest, we puts everything in constant dollars so that you don\u2019t get FX changes sort of clouding the picture. And then when you take a look at every individual quarter there\u2019s only day count issues. So maybe look at the bottom of that page and take a look at the quarter core accrual net interest revenue per day. And I think that what you\u2019re going to see is, we actually started to see an acceleration in net interest revenue core accrual net interest revenue last quarter.","You saw how that we went from 113.5 a day in the fourth quarter to 116.9 per day in the first quarter and now we have some additional growth up to the 121.6. So, we\u2019ve actually, this is actually two quarters in a row now of good acceleration in our core accrual net interest revenue.","And in both of those quarters, the growth -- it\u2019s roughly the same, it\u2019s about 50% of the growth being contributed through the ICG, the corporate business and that\u2019s tied into the loan growth, the growth in deposits, we\u2019ve got some incremental spread on some of our trade loans this quarter.","So, all of that is embedded in that. That\u2019s about half of it. And then the other half is somewhat split 50-50, 60-40, between the Consumer business and Corporate Treasury where we continue to benefit from the higher rate in Consumer from the growth in volumes, particularly some of the volumes we talked about in Asia, in Mexico and now with the growth of the full rate interest earning balances in Branded Cards.","So, all of that is embedded, but I don\u2019t want you to think that it was just a phenomenon. It certainly happened in the second quarter. It\u2019s actually two quarters in a row now of what I would call fairly good sequential growth in our net interest income.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. That\u2019s fair. I guess part of the question two is around the trading related NII, which with the flattening curve has been under pressure yet in 2Q improved. So, maybe give some color on that as well.","John Gerspach","Yeah. Every second quarter there is dividend season in Europe. And so we get into some special trades in the second quarter. If you look at last year, the first quarter of \u201817, compared to the second quarter of \u201817, you\u2019ll also notice that the trading related net interest revenue increased from the first quarter to second quarter last year. It was $140 million last year. It\u2019s $180 million this year. It really is just that seasonal dividend season trade that ends up being transacted in Europe. For the most part we still expect the headwinds to be there for net interest revenue in trading.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. And so your outlook for NII for the second half, that\u2019s based on the curve -- on the forward curve to think about that?","John Gerspach","Yeah. It\u2019s based upon the forward curve, it\u2019s also based upon our expectation for volumes and betas.","Betsy Graseck","Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon. One more balance sheet question, John.","John Gerspach","Yeah.","Ken Usdin","Just deposits are growing really well for you guys and the betas obviously picking up too especially sequentially. It\u2019s hard to seek some of the detail when we think about the averages. So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how you\u2019re looking at deposit growth and what you\u2019re paying in different markets and it\u2019s just a type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here?","John Gerspach","No. I\u2019d break it down into two distinct categories, Ken. So, for me a corporate deposit point of view, we\u2019ve been talking for some time about the fact that we\u2019ve seen increased sensitivity. And that increase -- that sensitivity has continued to increase. And so that has already being baked in and will continue to be baked into our net interest revenues, as well as our forward outlook for net interest revenues in those corporate deposits.","And from a corporate deposit point of view, sensitivity is -- I would say, they\u2019re little higher in North America than they are overseas, but again, all of that is baked in. Where we see a real difference so far is in U.S. retail sensitivity and those betas that we\u2019ve actually realized to-date have lagged our previous -- have lagged our estimates, and so some of that benefit is helping us in growing the net interest revenue at a somewhat faster pace that we had originally guided to.","But again, in the forward guidance that I\u2019ve given, our expectation is that those U.S. retail betas will increase in the second half of the year. So, we think that that\u2019s all baked into the additional growth that we\u2019ve given you in those outlook comments.","Ken Usdin","Okay. I understood. And what are your expectations for, I guess, generically these non-U.S. rate cycles, I mean, everyone is waiting for, it seems to be continue to be pushed out ECB and BoE, do you include any hikes from -- important to you non-U.S. yield curves as you think forward?","John Gerspach","We employ all the forward curves in our forward guidance. So, we use the forward curve where there is one in every country in which we operate. Obviously, the most important ones would be Mexico, as well as the U.S. and then some of the curves in Asia. But all of that is baked in.","Ken Usdin","Right. I guess I was just wondering if there\u2019s been any meaningful changes as you see it, there\u2019s a lot of curves for us to watch, you guys watch them all the time, but it seems like there is probably hasn\u2019t been that much changed lately?","Ken Usdin","No, no, not really","John Gerspach","Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Hi, John. Hi, Mike.","John Gerspach","Hi, Gerard.","Mike Corbat","Hi. Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","John, can you share with us -- you\u2019re ruling up the national digital platform as you described. When is the official kick-off where you\u2019re going to be able to, say that was, okay, it\u2019s up and running, it\u2019s fully implemented? And then, second, how are you guys going to measure the success of that strategy?","John Gerspach","Gerard, when we\u2019re ready for an actual date, we\u2019ll give it to you. We\u2019ve been rolling out features. We\u2019ve been testing a lot of functions. So, I would say, the best I could tell you right now is to expect a marketing campaign sometime in the early fourth quarter, maybe the late third quarter, but I can\u2019t give you a more definitive date than that at this point in time.","And then, we\u2019ll measure success on that both from a -- how we\u2019re doing from an NPS point of view, I mean, we do believe that our introduction of National Digital Banking will enhance our NPS. We\u2019re seeing really nice growth in our mobile NPS right now. So we feel good about the mobile app that we have. We feel good about the digital capabilities that we now have for our existing clients, and therefore, this is a chance for us to expand nationwide.","Gerard Cassidy","And as part of the roll out and the strategy, do you expect to have the feature or the ability for a new customer to open up the checking account. Obviously, the savings accounts are the ones that have been successful for everybody, but do you -- are you striving to be able to have straightforward way where a new customer could open up a checking account through the mobile or online?","John Gerspach","Yeah. We do. We actually already have that. We already have that built. It\u2019s just a matter of -- you want to make sure that it\u2019s completely tested before we broadly announce it\u2019s there.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. I see. And then coming back to the Credit Cards. Obviously, you had a big win with L.L. Bean. Are there any other in the pipeline types of bidding that you\u2019re doing where we could hear further announcements, second half of this year or early next year on Branded or on wins like this?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. We\u2019re in active conversations not just in the U.S., you heard us talk about Qantas. You heard us talk about Kohl\u2019s, so not just in the U.S. but we\u2019re in active conversations around the globe. And again, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything as chunky as a Costco, but these are terrific add-ons to the portfolio. In this case L.L. Bean high-quality, good spend, et cetera, and so we are -- we\u2019ve always got our eye out for them.","Gerard Cassidy","And speaking in pipelines any color on the investment banking pipeline and -- as you go into the second half of this year?","Mike Corbat","The environment remains strong, as we look at the pipeline, this quarter you saw advisory, you saw equity capital market strong. We had a tough comp to overcome in terms of DCM. But as you look at the deal pipeline and some of the things not just big, but intermediate sized things going on and we expect it to stay that way through the year.","Gerard Cassidy","And the last question, credit quality is strong for you and your peers, and you had improvement in many areas. I just didn\u2019t notice in Asia there was -- looked like you had an uptick in corporate and non-performers, again it\u2019s not a major issue. But was it, any color on -- it was one credit or any color there?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. One credit, you\u2019re going to get those things episodically, right.","Gerard Cassidy","Right. Right. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Not a problem, Gerard.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. I thought I\u2019d help you get to the record number of card questions as well. Just -- wanted to just ask one question, I want to make sure I heard what Mike was saying earlier. As we think about 2019, the ROA in North American Branded Cards should continue to -- should be improving from here regardless of any new partnerships that you may win?","Mike Corbat","That\u2019s correct.","John Gerspach","Correct.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","Mike Corbat","And Erika we\u2019re going to put that question in the card column and at the end of the day we\u2019ll give you a scoreboard tally to card\u2019s questions compared to efficiency questions. Thanks, Erika.","Erika Najarian","It\u2019s okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good afternoon. While I change gears and won\u2019t ask you about cards or efficiency, I\u2019ll ask about capital.","John Gerspach","All right.","Saul Martinez","All right. So on that have you give -- have your thoughts evolved on your capital planning and specifically your target CET1 in light of not only the stressed capital buffer which we realize hasn\u2019t been finalized and could change. But also the Fed adopting a more counter cyclical approach to the testing, this year, obviously, your stressed capital losses were elevated and if you use this years as the basis it would suggest that your capital cushion that you and some of your peers have above your target is pretty minimal. So just if you can give us your thoughts on how the capital planning processes is evolving?","John Gerspach","Yeah. Saul, that the short answer to your question is, no. Now, the longer answer is, when we put together the 11.5% ratio at Investor Day last year. We presented that, as representing the capital ratio, which we could prudently run Citi. And I think that we were very clear as to the various components that comprise that target and as you remember those components included a CET1 minimum requirement of 4.5% and then a GSIB surcharge of 3% and SCB that we then estimated at 3% and then a management buffer at 1%.","Now three months ago, the Fed published an NPR for the SCB, which I think largely confirm the industry\u2019s concerns about the variability that the SCB introduces into each firm\u2019s capital requirements. And I think that the most recent CCAR results, kind of -- they service proof that those concerns were well-founded.","And I think you\u2019re testing your counter cyclical buffer, if you look at what happens with the SCB in many ways that counter cyclical buffer is built into the SCB when you start to measure the peak to trough losses.","So I think that you look at CCAR results and I don\u2019t think that the Fed ever intended for the SCB to introduce this level of variability into the capital requirements of any individual firm or for that matter the industry as a whole. So I really do expect the changes are going to be made to that NPR before the SCB is actually implemented.","And further, I talked about the GSIB charge. I think the Fed is open to recalibrating the GSIB surcharge, especially if it moves forward with the SCB. So, I mean, don\u2019t forget the U.S. banks that are using the Fed\u2019s Method 2 approach, they\u2019re operating under a GSIB surcharge that significantly higher than what\u2019s called for under the Basel approved Method 1. So I think there is room for change in that component as well.","And then, the last thing I\u2019ll talk about is, don\u2019t forget this management buffer that we have of 1%. We establish that to cover some of the variability that we saw in various elements of the capital requirements. So if the SCB has implemented, creates some variability, but we could probably also look than to have the management buffer be raised or lowered periodically rather than just be set at some fixed element of the capital requirement.","So, given all of these potential moving pieces, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve got any clear reason to change that 11.5% target at the present time. For Mike and I, it still represents to us the best estimate of the CET1 ratio at which we should be prudently running Citi.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No. That\u2019s helpful. If I could change gears a little on that and ask a follow up on Mexico. It seems like you do have commercial momentum there but -- or improving commercial momentum there. But we did have a fairly sizable change politically at Mexico with the last not only winning but winning convincingly. Just any initial thoughts on what the implications of that are? What are your folks at Banamex saying about that?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think, you are right, we did have a decisive victory President elect L\u00f3pez Obrador clearly elected majorities now really in both parts of the house there. I would say that the reaction locally has been reasonably positive, you seen that manifest itself in terms of currency. Other pieces, he started to put some people in positions forward. The market\u2019s responding well to. He\u2019s come out and reiterated the sanctity of the Central Bank. He\u2019s reiterated the commitments of fiscal discipline. So I would say all those things so far make a positive thing.","And in this instance we shouldn\u2019t forget if you have someone elected by a popular majority. And consumers is not going to wake up and change their spending habits based on winning the outcome the pace that they want. I think what we\u2019re probably watching more short intermediate terms is the business reaction.","So we actually don\u2019t expect really much of any near-term reaction from a consumer perspective affecting our view potentially towards some uplift actually in terms of activity. We are watching your businesses in terms of FDI activity, investment and so forth, and again, it\u2019s too early to tell, but we haven\u2019t seen any reactions of significant so far.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Saul.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company.","Chris Kotowski","Yeah. Good afternoon.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Chris.","Chris Kotowski","Hi. You\u2019ve been discussing your international consumer strategy mainly in terms of online and mobile banking and so on. But at the same time, it just occurs to me that I can\u2019t walk into a drugstore these days without tripping over a Citi Branded cash machine. And I\u2019m going to imagine that\u2019s not a coincidence. And so I\u2019m kind of curious how you\u2019re planning on kind of integrating that physical presence with the online presence? And then, kind of follow-up to that, are your agreements with CBS, Walmart and RiteAid, is that -- are those national agreements, are they exclusive agreements and are they long-lived?","Mike Corbat","Yeah. They are national agreements. They are long-lived and then absolutely is part of the broader strategy. So, ultimately, if you\u2019re somewhere and you want to find it, yeah, we are going to be able to go on and find out at both Citi and whether it\u2019s a Citi branch or whether it\u2019s one of the ATMs you described. So, again, we think as adding to and supporting the national digital banking effort that that\u2019s a key component that gives those clients access to the cash and transaction of things they need.","John Gerspach","And of course, if you\u2019re Citigold client, we\u2019ll waive the ATM fees no matter where you go.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. But, so, I -- but presumably I could like get an online account at a -- with my Citi account and then I walk into a CBS in Dallas and I could still get cash out without a fee?","John Gerspach","Yeah.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. All right. Cool. Thank you. That\u2019s it.","John Gerspach","You bet Chris.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","John Gerspach","Hey, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi. Good afternoon. Hi. Good afternoon. I just had two quick questions. One, on the Corp\/Other you mentioned those are going to be 100 to 150 over the remainder of 2018, but is the expectation then that the kind of tracks lower from there as everything improves from there as the legacy assets roll-off into \u201819 and \u201820.","John Gerspach","I\u2019m going to get to \u201819 and \u201820 when closer to the fall at the next thing. Let\u2019s see how we do with interest rates. There is -- as I said before, there is a limited amount of legacy that is still yet to run-off. So you\u2019ll see.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then a quick follow up on Mexico, you mentioned it was tracking below the revenue growth target, but you didn\u2019t seem to indicate what was tracking below target, I mean is it just loan growth isn\u2019t it coming through as expected? I mean, what can you do to get Mexico back up to achieve the target?","John Gerspach","Yeah. It was basically revenue growth, Brian, is tracking slightly below target. Again, we have set up 10% CAGR for the period midway through \u201817 up through 2020. And while we had 11% this year, if you take a look at where we have been\u2026","Susan Kendall","This quarter.","John Gerspach","This quarter, where we\u2019ve been on the trailing 12 months is slightly below that. But, again, with good momentum.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Right. But on the revenue side what\u2019s tracking below? Is it just loan growth is weaker than expected, is it?","John Gerspach","Deposits, I would say, it\u2019s a combination of some slightly lower loan growth and slightly lower deposit growth.","Mike Corbat","Right.","John Gerspach","But, again, the important thing for us is that trend is improving, 4%, 6%, 9%, 11%, we think we\u2019re on the right trend line moving forward.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great. Thanks.","John Gerspach","No problem. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Susan Kendall","Great. Thank you all for your time today.

Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016, or $1.24 per share. These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings.","The results also show our institution\u2019s ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, and utilized additional deferred tax assets.","We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets, and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan which was just approved significant increases to the amount of capital we\u2019ll return over the next year.","In our institutional franchise, both our markets and investment banking businesses are rebounding client activity from the last quarter. And our treasury and trade solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates in support of our clients\u2019 needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.","In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in our U.S. branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process.","And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines, and in retail services, we\u2019re renewing our partnership with the Home Depot. We\u2019re excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from one year ago.","For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup\u2019s total earnings for the quarter. We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012.","While our remaining DTA does hamper, our return on tangible common equity utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.","During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately $30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last four quarters. Even so, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.","We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time and earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted. And as a result, we\u2019ll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next four quarters.","The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan shows the progress we continue to make to becoming a safer and stronger institution.","Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We\u2019re continuing to navigate the consequences of the UK referendum on the EU from its economic impact to how exactly it will structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the UK has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn\u2019t create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.","I think we\u2019ve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there has been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we\u2019re seeing.","And while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming \u2013 what will come in the months as we look forward, we\u2019re always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources. And I believe, we\u2019re very well-positioned from the capital, liquidity, and capacity perspective. John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.","We earned $4 billion in the second quarter, or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.","On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp is the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other.","Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year.","Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit.","Turning to Citi Holdings, both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year, as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets, or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.","Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity.","Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9% respectively from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates.","I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we\u2019re making in our core products. In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to-date.","Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly two-thirds being out of store, and the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size had already grown to a $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter.","Costco is a great partner and we\u2019re excited about the potential for this business. We\u2019re also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct-mail, e-mail, phone and Admiral\u2019s Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality growing portfolio and attractive returns.","The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pre-tax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond, as certain additional revenue sharing arrangements become effective.","Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot. We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals.","We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.","And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.","On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.","And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.","On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016.","Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower return mortgage loans, as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans as you can see on the lower right.","The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.","On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues.","In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Turning to Asia, as I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year, as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia. In response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market.","We moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover, as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields. But combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year.","We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which have seen slower overall market activity relative to last year. And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year with revenue growth to follow thereafter.","Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second-half of the year.","On Slide 10, we show the year over year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis. As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter, and the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.","Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients.","We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world. We\u2019re seeing the demand for our services increase, as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment, at the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies.","Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products.","Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And corporate lending revenues of $389 million were down 18%, as higher loan volumes were more than offset \u2013 more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.","Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates in currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the UK referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies.","We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our treasury and trade solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our fixed income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery particularly in securitized products.","Turning to equities, excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity, as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.","Finally, in security services, revenues declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation.","On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year, but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to non-accrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.","The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity. Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter.","This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvements in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits.","Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million.","On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first-half growth, although modest in our accrual and transaction services businesses, despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in treasury and trade solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity.","We remain disciplined in our core expense management, as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first-half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements, and of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.","Slide 13 shows the results for corporate\/other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year, as well as the lower debt buyback activity, and expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs.","On Slide 14, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.","Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM, and lower low yields. Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields, as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.","On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53.","Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter.","International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year.","Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our treasury and trade solutions business, as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients day-to-day banking needs around the world.","Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp other revenues are expected to be close to zero, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains.","Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at break-even for the quarter.","And with that Mike and I are happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Mitchell","Hey, good afternoon guys.","John Gerspach","Hey, Jim.","James Mitchell","Just a question on the energy credit, you \u2013 I think you said in June around $1.2 billion of, I think, energy-related credit costs. I think if I my math is right, you did about $500 million year-to-date, and now you\u2019re seeing $300 million to $500 million in the second-half, is that right? So, 8 \u2013 is that kind of way to think about $800 million to $1 billion right now?","John Gerspach","Well, the $1.2 billion, Jim, that was our reference to total Citi \u2013 total ICG cost of credit, that was not specific to energy\u2026","James Mitchell","Okay, fair.","John Gerspach","...at that point in time.","James Mitchell","So is \u2013 it does seem like it\u2019s a little bit of a step-down versus expectations even\u2026","John Gerspach","Well, certainly \u2013 it certainly, when you take a look at the first-half, which you know is about $500 million cost of credit in ICG. And with the second-half range of $300 million to $500 million, that gives you your comparison of $800 million to $1 billion against the previous $1.2 billion. So, yes, it is a step-down.","James Mitchell","And is that just simply the improvement in the capital markets in what you\u2019re seeing in terms of experience with the energy space and then getting capital, is that the big change, or is it oil prices or just the combination of both?","John Gerspach","Well, it\u2019s a combination of both. And certainly, we\u2019re benefiting \u2013 that outlook benefits from what we\u2019re seeing as a stabilization of energy cost with oil in that $45 barrel range. So I think, it also reflects the overall resiliency in our credit portfolio, which is what we\u2019ve been talking about. Now, we described to you the quality of our energy exposure in the past. First quarter, even in the first quarter, we said 73% of our energy exposure was to investment-grade names that has continued to remain at 73% in the second quarter.","James Mitchell","Right.","John Gerspach","The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, that\u2019s actually improved now to 65%. And because we\u2019re concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets.","James Mitchell","Right. An E&P balances were down too. So, okay\u2026","John Gerspach","Yes, I mean, when you take a look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, we traded off. We reduced the high risk portfolio and remained more concentrated in the high-quality portfolio.","James Mitchell","Right. Maybe just one follow-up on Costco, it seems like it\u2019s off to a pretty good start. You\u2019re obviously going to be building reserves there. Do you expect it to be added to the earnings, neutral to earnings, as we think about the combination of expenses, revenues, and provision build?","John Gerspach","Jim, our view going into the acquisition is that, in this first year in 2016, it would likely be neutral to earnings just because of the mechanics behind the reserve build. And so that\u2019s our view right now. We\u2019ll give you more updates as to how it could impact 2017, certainly as we get later in the year. But for now, I\u2019d say 2016 on EBT point of view is basically neutral.","James Mitchell","Right. So still sticking to neutral. Okay, thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","Okay, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks.","John Gerspach","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello there.","John Gerspach","Hey, Glenn, can you speak up a little bit. We really can\u2019t hear you.","Glenn Schorr","Really? I\u2019m screaming into it, sorry.","John Gerspach","Sorry.","Glenn Schorr","No problem, no problem. In cards, when I take a step back and I look at all the either renewal up rates or the acquisition costs, like cards is a super tough business right now, or I should say super competitive business right now. So I heard your comments about the 250 basis point ROA on the retail partner. Could you maybe talk about where the cards overall ROA and RoTCE is now and where it should be going forward, it kind of follows on, on Jim\u2019s question. I just like \u2013 just want to make sure we\u2019re growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys?","John Gerspach","Well, again, as we\u2019ve said, longer-term we \u2013 our view is from a branded cards portfolio, we want to be running that portfolio at about 225 to 235 basis points, which really is consistent with where we were entering into the crisis. So, what you\u2019ve seen through the crisis is a \u2013 an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now we\u2019ve all benefited from reserve releases.","So today, where we were getting ROA in branded cards something close to 300 basis points, but a lot of that has been fueled by reserve releases. The business that we\u2019re building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business. And it\u2019s the same story with retail services that 250 basis points is what we think is a realistic long-term return with that business.","Glenn Schorr","Got it, I appreciate that. You mentioned the renewal on American, most of the channels, I saw that Barclays had gotten, I think, it was the airports and on the plane, which I\u2019m not sure what that means. But what percentage of the originations in the past came from those channels, like do I care?","John Gerspach","Well, I mean, it certainly is a smaller amount of the originations than what we believe that we are going to be able to achieve through the channels that we retain. The on-airline and in-airport the \u2013 I\u2019d call it the travel day type of acquisitions, that was not a particular strength of ours anyway.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on, which one to choose? Okay, I saw the commentary on the more preferreds coming. With capital and leverage ratios so strong, like really strong and a payout ratio still at 70%, I\u2019m just curious where the incremental preferreds \u2013 what\u2019s their purpose, where they are going and why do you need them?","John Gerspach","Glenn, maybe I misspoke or \u2013 but we\u2019re not signaling that we are issuing more preferreds. We\u2019ve done our preferred issuance for now, given the capital stack that we have right now, our preferreds are where they are. But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters you\u2019re going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year.","Glenn Schorr","Oh, no problem, I got it.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate it.","John Gerspach","So if you take a look at Slide 32, that just sort of, we just want to level set your expectations as to where preferred dividends will be reflected. But all these preferred dividends reflect issuances already done.","Glenn Schorr","Totally appreciate it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.","John Gerspach","Okay, Glenn. Thank you.","Glenn Schorr","Bye, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. As Mike noted, the earnings came in nicely better than the first quarter. Just wondering, John, what are some of the items that got better since the early June guidance that earnings looked kind of flattish with the first quarter?","John Gerspach","I\u2019d say several things improved, John. Clearly, the markets \u2013 markets revenues were improved. What we found is during the month of June, we were able to engage with our corporate clients. They were seeking advice as to how to handle a volatility, both leading up to the UK referendum and then certainly subsequent to the UK referendum and that that gave us a great opportunity.","But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June.","And finally, we saw improved momentum in Mexico in the retail bank during the month of June. We noted that overall consumer revenues in Mexico grew 4% year-over-year that was higher than what we had thought that was going to be when Mike spoke. So we had momentum building in Mexico. We had good engagement with clients throughout the whole UK referendum. And then we benefited from the lower cost of credit again because of the high-quality of our book.","John McDonald","Okay. And you mentioned the corporate credit getting better and you gave an outlook for the cost of credit for ICG looking ahead. How should we think, John, about the provision trend in cards and overall consumer going forward from here?","John Gerspach","Well, again, that\u2019s going to intend to increase for two reasons. One is, as we build additional ANR and we\u2019re definitely in a growth mode when it comes to our card \u2013 our branded cards book. We\u2019re going to meet to build reserves just because of the volume. And then with Costco, again, when you get into purchase accounting, you\u2019ve got a heavy front-end build on LLR.","John McDonald","Okay. And then just one final thing on Costco, as you mentioned, that\u2019s starting to grow and you\u2019re getting the accounts. There have been some press stories and anecdotal reports of difficulties in the initial roll out. Were there some operational snafus that occurred? Have they been fixed and is everything running right now? Could you just give us an update on that?","Michael Corbat","John, it\u2019s Mike. I would say that we experienced extremely high calling volumes in the early implementation of it. We\u2019ve put a lot of resources at it, questions around card activation, questions around statements, questions around where to send payments. And so we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re gaining on it. We\u2019re very focused on it. We\u2019ve got a lot of resources deployed against it and it\u2019s something we can fix in the short order.","John McDonald","Okay. But you did mention John that the accounts are growing, sign-ups have been good?","John Gerspach","It\u2019s definitely are growing. I mean 330,000 new card acquisitions just since we took over the book that far exceeded our expectations by a factor of 2 and 2.5 times. So, again, we\u2019re really excited about. I think it speaks to the quality of the value proposition that that we put forward with that card in partnership with Costco.","John McDonald","Right. So just dealing with the volume operationally is what you\u2019re still working through?","John Gerspach","Yes, again, as Mike mentioned, the call wait times are coming down, but it\u2019s, yes, it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not the largest, it\u2019s got to be one of the largest portfolio implementation transfers on a single day that\u2019s ever been attempted. And that\u2019s not to give us excuses, I mean, we should be performing better than we are, but we\u2019re working on that. But again, it\u2019s a massive program.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","John Gerspach","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","On card another one here, the velocity in North America has been really, really good in both purchase volume and ANR. How long should we think about that sustaining and given some of the deals you\u2019ve just walked down from a modeling perspective how long can that sustain?","John Gerspach","Well, that\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t anticipate the same level now. You\u2019ve got two things, two factors. One is Costco obviously is going to benefit as now for the next year, so we\u2019re going to get a tremendous pickup from Costco. As in Costco though, we will begin on an ex-Costco basis some of that growth and we have 10% growth this quarter in purchase sales year-over-year, excluding Costco. That will begin to moderate sometime around towards the end of this year, the beginning of next year. But, again, we still anticipate getting good volume growth, but you\u2019re not going to get the same bump that you have when you start an investment program.","Brennan Hawken","All right. Okay, thanks. We also recently heard about some of your competitors widening out their credit box in card in recent years. Have you guys done that too? Have we seen a shift down within the Citi portfolio a bit of an expansion as far as credit, or can you maybe give a little color on that?","John Gerspach","We\u2019re still focused on the same target client that we had going in. If we moved by a basis point or two in FICO, that\u2019s about it. But when you take a look at where we\u2019re focused right now, it\u2019s still on that same target clients that I described to you in the past. And with the renewals that we\u2019ve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that we\u2019re really looking to build on.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. Just wanted to make sure. And then last one from me, the card trends in Asia, I appreciate your comments on the lower rewards in Australia. But when we look at the loan balances, it doesn\u2019t look like Australia is really all that big. Can that really move the needle? Can you help us understand how that would actually drive that those metrics?","John Gerspach","Well, again, it\u2019s not going to drive in this quarter in ANR, but it is going to drive purchase sale. So we have a lot of usage coming out of Australia. So the drop-down in Australia itself cost us a full percentage point on purchase sale growth year-over-year.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then that will probably just sustain for a year that lower volume, because it sounds like that\u2019s probably pretty structural, given the changes in that market?","John Gerspach","Well, what I would actually think is that as the other card issuers in Asia also adjust their rewards programs, what you\u2019ll see is less of an impact where people stop using their Citi Card. And as the programs become more consistent and more competitive with each other, we should get a pickup back again. So I don\u2019t think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And have you seen competitors move yet or just you\u2019re just anticipating it?","John Gerspach","I don\u2019t have anything particular in front of me that that would indicate what we\u2019ve seen yet on behavior. We\u2019ll get back to you.","Brennan Hawken","Sounds good. Thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. John, you touched on Mexico earlier, but can you talk about Mexico or more generally where do you see it in its profit cycle in addition to just consumer what you said is improving. And then a question for Mike, under what circumstances would you consider a sale of Mexico? I know that that\u2019s in the past, but your discount tangible book keep getting steeper and steeper especially as your tangible book value continues to cost?","John Gerspach","So to handle the first part of that question, Mike, there we were seeing good momentum throughout our Mexico franchise. We\u2019ve actually had great momentum in our ICG business in Mexico throughout the past year, year-and-a-half. It\u2019s consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which we\u2019re now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year. We anticipate having positive operating leverage coming out of the consumer business in Mexico straight on through 2017.","So we\u2019ve got an improving cards picture. We\u2019ve got a vibrant retail banking picture going on in Mexico. So we see that as an engine for growth out into the future.","Michael Corbat","And, Mike, from the strategic perspective, it really dovetails off of what John just described we like \u2013 as we have talked about. We like the demographics of Mexico, the growth prospects, where they are now post reforms. The position of Banamex in terms of its retail and consumer franchise, the scale of that our ability to compete. And so in a world that we see, at least, for the future ahead of us right now growth in the world\u2019s are pretty tough thing to find. We think Mexico offers that.","So based on what we see and what we think the opportunities are in the franchise, we think it\u2019s accretive to our shareholders. The return are solid, and we think we\u2019ve got the ability to continue to expand those. So right now, I really don\u2019t see a scenario, where we would contemplate selling.","Mike Mayo","The spirit behind the question and I know you, you understand this. I mean tangible book is close to 64 and the stock price is $44, and at some point the best investment is buying back your own stock. And but you created asset sale gains to, be allowed to buyback more stock, it\u2019s not something you should consider and you\u2019ve made a lot of strides. You discard many consumer operations outside the U.S. You reduced the size of Citi Holdings. Can\u2019t you reaccelerate some of that restructuring?","Michael Corbat","Well, if you look we just announced a pretty meaningful capital return. We\u2019re in the market and we\u2019ll be buying back $8.6 billion worth of stock over the next four quarters. As you look at our math and you look at our capital return capacity, we\u2019re going to have a lot of ability to buy stock back.","And when you think about the trade-offs between the stock buyback and growth, you\u2019ve got to find the right balance. So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, we\u2019re going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and I\u2019d like to keep investing and making sure, we\u2019re finding and continuing to build on growth.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Michael Corbat","Hey, good morning.","Erika Najarian","So because of your capital excess in both CET1 and SLR, your name keeps coming up as someone that can continue to take market share, particularly in ICG. And I\u2019m wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that we\u2019re not thinking about. And I guess the real question here is, where are you in terms of your scoring range on your GCIB surcharge? And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be?","Michael Corbat","Great question, Erika. And one that we contemplate every day. There\u2019s a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against, GCIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1 stress test capital call that CCAR capital, there\u2019s just many and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis.","So it\u2019s a constant trade-off, but the GCIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we\u2019re making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year we work to get there. And we ended the year now, I\u2019d say in the very high end of that score range.","And one of our goal is to remain in a 3% GCIB in a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so, we\u2019re actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you\u2019re right, those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GCIB score, we come out right at 630. So we\u2019re right in that range of where we need to be and we\u2019re going to keep on working to make sure that we end the year below that 630 target.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up question on the margin appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the puts and takes of Costco for the next \u2013 for the second-half of the year. If the slope of the curve persists or there\u2019s continued pressure on the long end, how should we think about how the marginal progress from that 290 level?","John Gerspach","One more weighted especially short-term to the short end of the curve. What we\u2019ve told you in the past is, if the rates move by a 100 basis points, we\u2019ll generate an additional around the world of $1.9 billion of additional net interest income. And most of that $1.9 billion will be concentrated in the U.S. which is I think about a $1.4 billion. And most of that $1.4 billion is focused on the short end.","So the long end of the curve, especially in the near-term the next year, year-and-a-half doesn\u2019t really impact us all that much.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay. No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. John, we saw a progress this quarter in the efficiency ratio as you mentioned. And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that we\u2019ve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know there\u2019s some seasonality?","John Gerspach","I feel pretty good about the second-half. But what we had said at the end of the first quarter is that our target would be to do 58% efficiency for the full-year, given what we \u2013 the given the first quarter results. And I\u2019d say that still is where our target is, is at or around that 58% efficiency ratio in Citicorp for the full-year.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And I know it\u2019s hard to talk about seasonality and given the flurry that we just had of activity in the markets business in June. But how would you characterize how we should think about quote, unquote seasonality or normal seasonality in the summer for the business. And do you \u2013 have you seen any change in activity as things have kind of calm down post the initial reaction of f Brexit?","John Gerspach","The \u2013 it\u2019s still very, very, very early in the third quarter. So it\u2019s a little hard to comment on activity for an entire quarter after just eight, nine trading days. But the activity levels are fine that I think it\u2019s good. And we\u2019ll have to see how everything holds up into the month of August, but again the beginning part of July looks fine.","Ken Usdin","Great. One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, it\u2019s a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here?","John Gerspach","I like the prospects of growing NII, I mean, obviously with Costco coming on, that gives us the big boost. I talked about the momentum that we got in for the consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America with branded cards.","So, yes, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have a prepared comment on guidance on NII. I don\u2019t like to give guidance on individual line items of the income. But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and that\u2019s why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year.","Ken Usdin","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. John, a couple of questions. The first is on Slide 28, where you have the ICG unfunded corporate energy exposure?","John Gerspach","Yes.","Eric Wasserstrom","The double and single B component looks like, it actually grew by close to $1 billion versus last quarter. And I\u2019m wondering, if that\u2019s from actual additional exposure or is that from the down \u2013 the ratings migration of existing exposures?","John Gerspach","Well, and some of that is migration. There\u2019s a variety of factors that that go into that. But there\u2019s nothing in there that would indicate that there\u2019s something deteriorating, or anything else it\u2019s just a series of puts and takes.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And the \u2013 I think you previously indicated that 65% of the total of about $35 billion is either investment-grade or has credit support. Has that figure changed at all?","John Gerspach","No, I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So I apologize for that. We\u2019ll have to get back, yes. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any big deterioration there. I just don\u2019t have that with me.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, great, no problem. And then just following up on sort of several of the questions and your responses, we think about the back-half of this year. It sounds like what you\u2019re pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue. Is that broadly correct?","John Gerspach","Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on what you might pull out of your own model. But in broad strokes I would be cautious about thinking that I\u2019ve guided you to balance sheet expansion. Balance sheet expansion is not really something that we\u2019re targeting. As I said, we still believe that we can optimize our balance sheet. So I wouldn\u2019t factor in undue expansion of the balance sheet.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Yes, I was sort of speaking of within Citicorp, but rather than broadly. But would Citicorp still be broadly low like, I mean, I think it was up about 1% in the period?","John Gerspach","The balance sheet growth?","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes.","John Gerspach","I\u2019m not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet. Let\u2019s just say that, again, from the overall level of about $1.8 trillion for the overall Citigroup, that\u2019s broadly the area that we still believe that we should be operating.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning.","Michael Corbat","Morning.","Steven Chubak","So, John, I had a quick question on CCAR, maybe a bit of a follow-up to Erika\u2019s earlier question. The results are priced very positively in the latest round. As you prepare for some of the tougher elements like GCIB surcharge inclusion, how are you thinking about the capital minimums or targets that you need to amass to day to day as part of your allocation process? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to whether this has changed significantly just given the favorable results that we saw in the latest stress test round?","John Gerspach","Well, first of all, Steven, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do about GCIB surcharge in CCAR, because unless something happen this morning while I\u2019ve been sitting here we haven\u2019t seen any proposed rule yet. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re obviously aware of the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. But, again, we just don\u2019t know, so that has not impacted our planning as yet at all.","Steven Chubak","Okay, got it. And I recognize, John, that you don\u2019t want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that. I know that there\u2019s some FX translation impacts that could influence the moves in RWA. But given how much Holdings has shrunk, is it reasonable to assume that RWA growth will wrap Citicorp growth going forward in terms of\u2026?","John Gerspach","Well, actually, if you \u2013 yes, Steven, if you look Holdings RWA declined by about $8 billion or $9 billion in the quarter. And if you look our RWA overall dropped by about $8 billion in the quarter.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay. One more quick modeling question for me on legal and repositioning costs. You\u2019d guided to the 225 basis points for Citicorp for the full-year. It looks like there has been a higher run rate in those expenses in the first-half. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation for what we should be modeling for the second-half for legal and repositioning?","John Gerspach","I would still say that for the full-year, the 225 is still a pretty good number.","Steven Chubak","Perfect. Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Well\u2026","John Gerspach","Hi, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Just stepping back bigger picture, you\u2019ve done a lot of work in the credit card businesses, a lot of upfront investing, obviously renewal of some contracts, gaining some contracts. So there\u2019s still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view. If you look at the rest of the franchise across the products and the markets, are there other areas that you want to focus on increasingly so on investment dollars, or do we start to see maybe some moderation in some of the spend?","Michael Corbat","For the investment perspective, Matt, I think we remained largely consistent with the things that we talked about before. So we talked about equities and we talked about what we\u2019re trying to do there the combination of prime brokerage, the combination of cash derivative Delta One and investments in people balance sheet, et cetera. So those continue. Investments in our network and our cash management business in that investments in digital and our interface on the consumer side. So, again, things that we\u2019ve consistently spoken about those investments continue.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And just how you think about?","Michael Corbat","I would describe it\u2019s outsized.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Is it fair, I mean, it feels like the credit card and some of it shows up in expenses and some of it\u2019s a contra-revenue. But it seems like that was a pretty big effort to get behind you. And are these other things more kind of in a run rate or business as usual?","Michael Corbat","I would say from a technology perspective, we probably need to think of a lot of those investments ongoing as business as usual. I think of the equities investment is probably being slightly different in terms of \u2013 there\u2019s a life to it and there\u2019s a set of expectations that we\u2019ve got to make sure we achieve out of those investments.","John Gerspach","I think, Matt, what you\u2019ll see is, we\u2019ll continue to invest where we have the prospects for growth. So you\u2019re likely to see still we\u2019ll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so that\u2019s embedded in that. We\u2019ll continue throughout U.S. to spend money to enhance our digital capabilities.","So we do have investment dollars at play. So I don\u2019t want to tell you that, we\u2019re not going to be investing. Just to keep our TTS network in place, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that is not going to stop. But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we don\u2019t see any large lumpy dollar where we\u2019re going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. That\u2019s what I was getting at. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good afternoon.","John Gerspach","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","So a question just on capital creation, because clearly you are creating capital faster than earnings, thanks to things like Holdings shrinking and the DTA utilization and all that. And I\u2019m wondering, do you get any credit from the regulators for this in your opinion? And is there an opportunity, do you think at some point, maybe it\u2019s once we get through the CCAR buffer for GCIBs that\u2019s coming. But do you think there is a point when you\u2019ll be able to talk to them about the DTA utilization and the incremental capital from that going towards share repurchase as opposed to factoring into the whole CCAR process?","Michael Corbat","When we think about capital generation and in particular capital returns, we don\u2019t as you reference think of that in terms of earnings, because we\u2019ve got the capacity and I think Slide 33 shows the drivers of capital and DTA that we\u2019ve got this ability through the utilization of DTA and again $10 billion used we since it peaked to generate regulatory capital at a kind of pretty significant rate.","So we understand that if we\u2019re not returning all of that excess capital and so if we measure ourselves, we measure ourselves against finding capital constraints, and today that would most likely be CCAR. What do we need to run the institution, what do we need is a buffer, and it\u2019s our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can\u2019t use. And in this environment that\u2019s probably the bulk of earnings and DTA liberalization.","And when you think about the difference between our TCE and our CE Tier 1, it\u2019s largely the $29 billion of disallowed DTA. And so as we liberate that, we\u2019d like to return them. I think it\u2019s part of that conversation that\u2019s not nor will be a prospective conversation. But as we liberate it, we then want the ability to return that in arrears. And we\u2019ve been in conversations with our regulators about that and that will I think continue to show itself over time.","Betsy Graseck","So, I guess, is it \u2013 this upcoming rule that we\u2019re waiting for from the Fed regarding the GCIB buffer, GCIB surcharge increase for the folks like you that we\u2019re waiting for you get through that and then maybe the ask can go up? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about timing around that?","Michael Corbat","We\u2019ve consistently talked about walking the ask up. This year was a tripling of the dividend and meaningful increase in terms of buyback and it\u2019s our intention around the right operating environment and the right results to continue to do that. And again going back to the knowing that unless we do that and we return or use all of this excess capital, we\u2019re going to have a denominator problem. And so we\u2019re committed to doing that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple one. First of all, John, in terms of the DTA utilization, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times on the call freeing up that asset. I guess, I\u2019m just curious why the pace of the DTA utilization was so much slower in the second quarter than the first quarter, given it looks like North American consumer profitability, pre-tax profitability was roughly similar quarter-over-quarter? And just looking through some of the ICG numbers, that it appears North American profitability there was also relatively similar quarter-over-quarter?","John Gerspach","Yes, Matt, if it was very simple to give you the formula as far as how you drive down the DTA, I\u2019d love to lay it out. But it just doesn\u2019t work that way. It has to do with certainly where the earnings are generated, importantly, how much of that is coming out of current taxes that that are due as opposed to how much you can put against your deferral.","So it\u2019s difficult to give you well if earnings are bit and the DTA will be back. There\u2019s just a lot of other things that go into it. But in general, again, we\u2019re focused on driving it down. And I think as Mike said, we\u2019re obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years. And we should be able to continue to utilize it somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year that\u2019s going to be the pace.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just moving on to page 24 of the supplement, I realize we\u2019re looking at end of period balances, so there may be something skewing this a little bit. But the corporate loans in EMEA grew in the second quarter at a much faster rate than you\u2019ve seen them grow year-over-year. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s sort of a one-quarter blip possibly driven by Brexit, or are you really driving market share gains on the lending side, partly because of some of the challenges of the European banks?","Michael Corbat","Yes, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you on that, Matt, I\u2019m sorry.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally, John, maybe following up on Betsy\u2019s question. Looking really at this CCAR cycle, you\u2019ve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change. I guess, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about potentially requesting a de minimis or a further increase in the buyback in this CCAR cycle using the de minimis exception?","Michael Corbat","Yes, Matt, in that, I would say that it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, let\u2019s see how the year progresses and where we are and we\u2019ll make that judgment or that call later in the year.","Matt Burnell","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klainhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Klainhanzl","Thanks.","Michael Corbat","Hey, Brian.","Brian Klainhanzl","I had two questions. First on the Costco, you mentioned that the reserving would start in the back-half of this year, but do you get from the fair value marks, does that last you to third quarter? So you\u2019re not really going to see the reserving start until the fourth quarter, or does that start as early as the third quarter?","Michael Corbat","No, it actually started in the second quarter. But, again, we only had the portfolio for 13 days. But if you remember we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated when we\u2019d purchase a loan portfolio, we acquired the receivables and they\u2019re recorded at fair value, so there\u2019s no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR build.","If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a matured portfolio, in a matured portfolio that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, if the acquired loans don\u2019t have an LLR, there\u2019s no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build to a, let\u2019s call it normalized LLR for an acquired portfolio is actually depended on how fast the new loans are created, as well as how fast the old loans pay down.","So if the pay down rate really has the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high pay down rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more front-loaded than with the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you\u2019re going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio.","Brian Klainhanzl","Okay, thanks. That was very helpful. And then also related to Costco on the purchase, obviously the intangibles went up. What\u2019s the life of those for the amortization schedule? Is it amortized over one year, two years?","John Gerspach","I believe tangibles would tie back to the contract.","Brian Klainhanzl","Okay. And then just lastly, I guess going back to 2013, I mean, Mike you provided a nice update as to back in March of 2013 as to your long-term strategy of where you\u2019re going to be investing. Is there any plans to provide another one of those updates of the kind of benchmark what you\u2019ve done over the last three years, because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been done, but kind of what you are going to do to kind of drive the company forward?","John Gerspach","Yes, we plan on doing that. We haven\u2019t set a date in terms of coming out. But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll probably come out with some talk about when we\u2019re going to go up more broadly.","Brian Klainhanzl","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","John Gerspach","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","John, you talked about how you had better than expected growth in the number of new cards from the Costco \u2013 new accounts from the Costco acquisition in these early days. Were the purchase sales as better than expected as the acquisition of the new accounts?","Michael Corbat","Purchase sales, I can say are running roughly in line with what we had anticipated, maybe a little bit higher, but roughly in line.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And the two-thirds outside of the store, is that in line with your expectations as well on the purchase sales?","Michael Corbat","That\u2019s in line.","Gerard Cassidy","Yes. Is there anyway of taking this bigger with your global reach outside the U.S. than what maybe American Express could have done with Costco?","Michael Corbat","I\u2019m not prepared just to talk about. Let\u2019s absorb what we\u2019ve got right now first. Obviously, we\u2019re still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, let\u2019s give them a delightful experience first and then we\u2019ll think about international.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Clearly, you guys have made a commitment to cards with this acquisition and your other acquisitions. Are there any other portfolios that you are aware of that might come up for bidding in the next 12 or 18 months of meaningful size?","Michael Corbat","Of meaningful size. There is a couple intermediate size bites over the next few years, but there\u2019s nothing of any real significance. Obviously, like we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at those, and if the numbers and returns work, we\u2019ll obviously compete for them, and if not we won\u2019t.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to this question. Obviously you guys are very well capitalized. The regulators control what you can give back in excess capital similar to your peers. Is there ever a thought of if you\u2019re limited and we won\u2019t know for a couple years that you can only give back what you earn every year and nothing above it.","Is there a thought with your investments in the digital consumer capabilities that you are doing, that mobile channel to pursue a more aggressive consumer business in the United States, obviously you don\u2019t have a retail branch network and you probably don\u2019t need it in the future like some of your bigger peers. But is there any thought that you guys have, as your mobile channel is very robust, very strong, can you take that even bigger to grow that faster nationwide?","John Gerspach","Well, I think we have that opportunity whether or not, we have the issue that you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to end up with. But even if we are able to return all the capital that we think we have, I think we still have the opportunity to grow our consumer business in the U.S. as a result between digital and mobile. Those are things that we\u2019re definitely focused on.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Shifting gears on you, I know you talked about the ICG business and obviously what went on post Brexit with the trading. Was there any significant change in the pipeline in investment banking activity post Brexit? I know it\u2019s not that long ago. But anything there to talk about?","John Gerspach","Well, I think the pipeline remains pretty strong. And actually on the heels of Brexit, we saw actually quite good deal flow. You saw debt capital markets, you saw equity capital markets, you saw M&A getting executed getting announced. So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets. We\u2019ve got an environment in which we can continue to get these things done. So it feels pretty good.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just finally, your \u2013 obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and it\u2019s still very strong. But there\u2019s always moving parts, and so one of the questions on the moving parts is, I think it was on the supplement package on page 33, you give us the breakout of your non-accrual loans in corporate and consumer. I notice you had some real good improvement in Latin America, they dropped quite a bit. But EMEA jumped up quite a bit in the quarter on non-accrual. Was that in energy-related credit or Brexit related credit or credits?","John Gerspach","Two energy-related names in EMEA caused that.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, great. And look forward to see those, Mike, those new guidelines that you guys are going to hopefully announce later on. And just I would also throw an Investor Day now that you guys are moving forward, you might want to consider that for 2017, even though Susan is probably not happy about that. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Susan Kendall","All right. Thank you all for joining us for the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Jamie. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.1 billion for the third quarter of 2017 or a $1.42 per share including the impact of the sale of our fixed income analytics business. We delivered a very strong quarter showing the balance of our franchise by both product and geography and highlighting our multiple engines of client-led growth. We have revenue increases in many of the product areas we have been investing in, tightly managed our expenses, and again saw loan and deposit growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses. We've made progress towards the targets we discussed on Investor Day in terms of ROTCE 9.8% ex-DTA year-to-date and efficiency ratio of 57% year-to-date and we also returned over 6 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter.","Turning to our businesses, in global consumer banking we generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in all three regions Asia, Latin America, and North America. In the U.S. retail banking and retail services both had growth and while we didn't see the year-over-year revenue growth we\u2019d anticipated in branded cards, we did show good sequential growth at 5% driven by growth in full rate balances and strong client engagement. Our institutional clients group again delivered excellent results and continued to gain wallet share as a result of our efforts to deepen our relationships with our target clients. Treasury and trade solutions grew 8% and we saw double digit growth across investment banking, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services. While total trading revenues were down by 11%, trading activity was better than we had anticipated earlier in the quarter and equity was up 16%. ","You can also see the impact of our $19 billion capital plan during the quarter. We generated $4.7 billion of regulatory capital during the quarter driven by earnings and DTA utilization. And we returned 6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders enabling us to begin to reduce the amount of capital we hold. Year-to-date payout is nearly 100%. Including the impact of repurchasing over 80 million shares during the quarter, we reduced our common shares outstanding by over 200 million or 7% over the past year.","We've reduced our common equity tier one capital ratio to 13%, still 150 basis points above the 11.5% we believe we need to prudently operate the firm. Given the amount of stock repurchasing power in our capital plan, we remain committed to reaching that level over time. Overall we continue to make progress in increasing both the return on and return of capital for our investors.","The macro environment remains a largely positive one, growth while not as high as we would like remains consistent and we don't see too many economies in distress. However, while geopolitical tensions don't seem to have weighed on growth at least as of yet, I don't know how long that can continue. And while tax reform remains a question mark we do like the direction the administration is going in terms of regulation which we see as just a course to accommodate higher growth rather than a full scale regulatory repeal agenda.","With that John will go through our presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Hey, thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 3, we showed total Citigroup results. Net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter grew 8% from last year including a $580 million pretax gain on the sale of yield book, a fixed income analytics business which benefited EPS by $0.13 per share. Excluding the gain, EPS of $1.29 grew by 4% driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting the gain on sale as well as 3% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Offset by lower revenues in Corporate\/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets. ","Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased mostly reflecting volume growth, seasoning, hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserve builds and additional reserve builds in North America cards which I'll cover in more detail shortly. In total we've built $100 million of hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserves across North America and Latin America GCB as well as the legacy portfolio in Corporate\/Other. ","Year-to-date total revenues grew 3% year-over-year including 7% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat and net income grew 7% driving a 13% increase in earnings per share including the impact of share buybacks. In constant dollars Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 653 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $26 billion in total with contribution from every region and consumer as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending. ","Turning now to each business, slide 4 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues grew 1% year-over-year and 5% sequentially in the third quarter. Retail banking revenues of 1.4 billion grew 1% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues declined significantly, mostly reflecting lower origination activity. However we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 12% driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management as well as the benefit from higher interest rates. We're continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold Wealth Management offering driving growth in both household and balances with improving penetration of investment products. ","Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion were down slightly from last year. Client engagement continues to be strong with average loans growing by 8% and purchase sales up 10% year-over-year. We generated year-over-year growth in full rate revolving balances in our core portfolios. However non-core balances continued to run off as expected. And we face continued headwinds from growth in transactor and promotional balances which we are funding at a higher cost versus last year given the higher interest rate environment. Full rate revolving balances which had been flat since the beginning of the year began to grow this quarter as new loan vintages matured and started to accrue interest. This drove 5% sequential growth in revenues this quarter. However, it was not sufficient to deliver year-over-year growth. ","Relative to our expectations going into 2017, we're seeing solid revenue growth in several products including Costco and Double Cash. However in aggregate we are seeing slower than anticipated revenue growth in our proprietary business mostly driven by a higher mix of promotional balances in our portfolio. Finally retail services revenues of 1.7 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America in consumer were $2.5 billion down 5% from last year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings. Digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users including 22% growth among mobile users versus last year. We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost digital channels. For example, increasing e-statement penetration and lowering call center volumes while improving customer satisfaction. ","Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by over $300 million year-over-year reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio which did not incur losses in the third quarter of last year, episodic charge offs in the commercial portfolio which were offset by related loan loss reserve releases this quarter, and overall portfolio growth and seasoning. We also built $460 million of loan loss reserves with a roughly $500 million reserve build in cards being partially offset by the reserve release in commercial banking. The reserve build in cards was comprised of roughly $150 million for volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios, $50 million related to the estimated impact of the hurricanes, and about $300 million to cover our forward-looking NCL expectations. About two thirds or $200 million of this amount related to retail services where we could see the NCL rate increase from 470 basis points in 2017 to roughly 500 basis points next year. And the remainder is attributable to branded cards where we expect the NCL rate of 285 basis points this year to rise by about 10 basis points in 2018.","On slide 5 we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were up 4% versus last year driving a 6% increase in operating margin. In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 4% year-over-year. This is somewhat slower than recent periods driven in part by lower industry wide deposit growth this quarter which we expect to recover as we go into year-end. Card revenues grew slightly year-over-year on continued improvement in full rate revolving loan trends. And expenses also grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth partially offset by efficiency savings. ","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year driven by improvement in wealth management and cards, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Higher card revenues reflected 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year. And while retail lending revenues declined versus last year we saw a sequential revenue growth again this quarter. Expenses in Asia grew 4% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending were partially offset by efficiency savings. Total international credit costs grew 4% year-over-year mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in Latin America. ","Slide 6 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. In North America the sequential increase in the NCL rate reflects the commercial charge offs I noted earlier while the NCL rate declined in both card portfolios.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 7, revenues of $9.2 billion grew 9% from last year reflecting the previously mentioned gain on sale as well as continued solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of 4.7 billion grew 11%, treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion were up 8% reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads. Growth in TTS was balanced across net interest and fee income with fees up 9% on higher payment, clearing, and commercial card volumes as well as higher trade fees. Investment banking revenues of 1.2 billion were up 14% from last year with a wallet share gains across debt and equity underwriting and M&A.","Private Bank revenues of 785 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investment activity and deposits, as well as improved spreads. And corporate lending revenues of 502 million were up 14% reflecting lower hedging costs and improved loan sale activity. We continued to see strong engagement with our global subsidiary clients this quarter as they borrowed to support core business activities. ","Total markets and security services revenues of 4.6 billion grew 3% including the gain on sale. Fixed income revenues of 2.9 billion declined 16% on lower G10 rates and currencies revenues given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago as well as lower activity in spread products. Our local markets rates and currencies business grew modestly as we remained engaged with our corporate clients across our global network. ","Equities revenues were up 16% reflecting client led growth across cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance. And finally in security services revenues were up 12% driven by growth in client volumes across our custody business along with higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of 4.9 billion increased 5% year-over-year as investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance and the gain on sale, our comp ratio remained at 26%. ","On a year-to-date basis ICG revenues of $28 billion grew by 10%, even while trading revenues remained flat to last year. We generated half of our revenues in banking which grew 13% on continued momentum in TTS, investment banking, the private bank, and corporate lending. And we're seeing strong growth in security services as well which we view is similar to TTS in many ways as a foundation for developing broader relationships with our investor clients.","Slide 8 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of 509 million declined significantly from last year driven by legacy asset runoff, divestitures, and the impact of hedging activities. Expenses were down 36% reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses. And the pretax loss in Corporate\/Other was roughly $260 million this quarter. We believe this level of $250 million to $300 million of pretax loss per quarter is a fair run rate to expect for Corporate\/Other through 2018.","Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. As you can see total net interest revenue declined slightly from last year to 11.4 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was outpaced by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue. Core accrual net interest revenue of 10.4 billion was up 5% or $450 million from last year driven by the impact of higher rates and volume growth, partially offset by a higher level of long-term debt. ","On a sequential basis core accrual revenue grew by nearly $350 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the June rate increase, loan growth, and mix. Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by $1.5 billion year-over-year and we expect to see roughly $500 million of additional growth in the fourth quarter. However, on a full year basis we expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $900 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate\/Other.","On slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 13% as net income was more than offset by $6.4 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.1% and our tangible book value per share grew by 6% year-over-year to $68.55 driven by a 7% reduction in our shares outstanding. As we look to the fourth quarter, in consumer we expect continued modest year-over-year revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both North America and international consumer. In total we have achieved sequential growth in pretax earnings in global consumer banking for the last two quarters and we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter. ","On the institutional side we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in our accrual businesses including TTS, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services. Market revenues will likely reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter. And investment banking revenues should be similar to this quarter assuming a continued favorable environment. We remain on track to achieve an efficiency ratio of 58% for the full year and cost of credit in the fourth quarter should be broadly in line with the third quarter driven by the normalization of credit cost in ICG offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Finally we expect our tax rate to remain at around 31% in the fourth quarter and with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ","Glenn Schorr","Hey, thanks very much. A couple of quickies if I could on cards, the first one on just the average yields being about in line year-on-year. You mentioned balance transfer is still part of the mix, is -- our balance transfers some are rolling off but are you rolling new ones on, I'm just curious on what you're doing there?","John Gerspach","Yeah Glenn, we are definitely rolling on new promotional balances.","Glenn Schorr","And is that branded and Costco or is it more on the branded side?","John Gerspach","Well Costco is part of branded but I think maybe the best way to think about this is if you take a look at what's going on with branded cards revenues in general. I think there is three factors that you need to discuss in order to explain where we are with the cards revenue growth. And the first is that as we saw the competitive dynamics and the rewards offerings in the U.S. heat up late in 2016. At that time we made a conscious decision to shift our acquisition program away from rewards oriented products and more towards value products. Now value products as we've been discussing, those typically feature a promotional period and so this change in tactics combined with the fact that the initial response to our value acquisition offerings was even stronger than we anticipated has resulted in a higher amount of these non-yielding promotional balances in our portfolio. And based upon the performance of the earlier vintages we expect these promotional balances will generate growth and full rate balances but, in the near-term we're seeing a dampening effect on revenues caused by this shift in focus. So that's one factor. ","Then secondly there's also a dampening effect on the revenues against where we anticipated just caused by the higher rates. If you remember when we went into the year, our planning was based upon one 125 basis point hike in rates in the U.S. during 2017 and in fact so far we've seen two. And while the higher rates are overall accretive to the U.S. consumer business we've also talked about the fact that higher funding rates increase the near-term revenue drag caused by promotional balances. So that's the second factor. Now as late as June we believe that despite the drag of the higher promo balances and the higher funding rates we'd still be in position to deliver at least some level of year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. brand cards beginning in the third quarter. However this is where the third factor comes into play. ","Beginning in July we saw a slight uptick in the overall payment rate across the proprietary portfolio but while small it was just enough to take us from a small increase in revenue year-over-year to a small decrease. So three factors; change in acquisition focus, slightly higher interest rates, and a slight increase in payment rates that have combined to result in the third quarter 2017 branded card revenues to be just below the level that we had in third quarter 2016.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I definitely appreciate all that detail John. Are you seeing actual organic growth outside, I guess it's tough to differentiate given your strategy but are you seeing actual organic growth in Costco?","John Gerspach","Absolutely, Costco remains a real winner. We've continued to be able to grow account balances, we've seen continued growth in the purchases. So it's still looking like an absolute winner for us.","Glenn Schorr","And just last one cleaning up, were there any sales of the liquid loans in the quarter that we should know about?","John Gerspach","Just the normal level that we would do every quarter. There was always a small amount but there's nothing unusual this quarter. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, thanks for all that John. ","John Gerspach","Not a problem Glenn. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning John. I wanted to ask about the retail services business on the private label card. You mentioned the loss rate there could go to 5% from 470 this year, just kind of wondering what you're seeing, are you still seeing kind of roll rates deteriorate a bit from initial delinquency, the charge off and is that what you're kind of building into that outlook for next year? ","John Gerspach","Yeah, that's it exactly, John. It's exactly what we've been talking about for the last nine months or the last three quarters. And while we've seen some improvement in those later stage delinquency bucket roll rates, it's still higher than what we thought it was going to be. So that's what is feeding into that. It has fed into the increased guidance that we've given you during the course of the year driving another 2017 expected NCL rate from 435 basis points coming in to the year to 470 basis points now. And so you know, reflecting about a 30 basis points, 30-35 basis point increase where we otherwise would have expected retail services to be in 2018.","John McDonald","And is that what the reserving action this quarter brings you to see if you kind of reserved for that outlook of 5% now?","John Gerspach","Yeah, maybe if you want I'll go through both branded cards and retail services because it's the same three factors that impact both of them. So when you think about the branded cards, LLR build up, you know, we built about $200 million of the LLR of that 500 in branded cards. And there's about on a normal basis given growth and seasoning in branded cards we probably have about $50 million to $100 million in the quarter. So figuring the midpoint to be about 75, we added $25 million of reserves to cover our estimated impact of the hurricanes. And then finally in branded cards we're looking at an NCL rate of about 10 basis point growth next year and that will go from about 285 this year to 295 next year. That's a little bit higher than what we had previously considered. ","It's still in line with our long-term 300 to 325 basis points but we'll probably get to 295 next year. You take a 10 basis point increment in your NCL rate, multiply it by an $85 billion loan portfolio, adjust that for 14 to 15 months of coverage and that adds about $100 million accrual on to branded cards. So overall, 75 that I would consider to be normal, 25 for hurricanes, and 100 just to adjust to that forward look. So when you think about that forward look maybe perhaps we could have taken more of a wait and see approach over the next several quarters but our assessment was that it was appropriate to take that reserve build now. So all things being equal I'd expect that the fourth quarter reserve build would be back in that range of $50 million to $100 million in branded cards that we would consider to be more normal. ","And then if you move over to retail services, it is similar to what we just went through with branded cards. We had that $300 million reserve build in retail services and again if you look at retail services, the normal reserve build there is again kind of in that $50 million to $100 million range. And with retail services we'd likely be in the upper end of that range right now, just given the volume build that we've seen. So call that 90, 85, 100 somewhere in that range. Then there's another $25 million for hurricanes that we've put away in retail services to cover the estimated losses that we think could occur. ","And then again as we look forward and we think about the NCL rate next year being 30 to 35 basis points higher than what we had previously thought about, again you take 30 to 35 basis points, multiply it by a current $46 billion portfolio, adjust that for a 14 to 15 month coverage period and that gets you the extra $200 million reserve build there. So $75 million to $80 million to $100 million for normal; 25 for hurricanes, 200 for the forward look that gets you to that 300 to 320 that gets in the supplements. And again just like in branded cards perhaps we could have taken more of a wait and see approach but we thought it was appropriate to take the reserve build now. ","And again all things again being equal with retail services I'd expect that we'd be back in that upper end of that $50 million to $100 million normal range in the fourth quarter. Let me just finish it because if we\u2019re adjusting that range up to 500 basically basis points of losses in retail services in 2018, we're also going to take the medium term view of retail services up from where we have talked about on Investor Day of being about 500 basis points to be more in the range of 510 to 525 basis points. So again, not a big change but we're going to make that change in the forward guidance.","John McDonald","Okay, that's very helpful, appreciate the detail there. And just one quick strategic question on retail services, is this a portfolio and a business that you're looking to grow, do you see that growing or adding new partners or growth within the existing partners or is it something that probably feels pretty stable over the next few years?","John Gerspach","I think it's an area John if opportunities present themselves as we've seen in Best Buy and other and if portfolios make sense we clearly got the capital balance sheet, liquidity capacity, and if the returns makes sense we\u2019d be happy to take them on.","John McDonald","And without new -- without acquisitions or anything does that grow or does it stay pretty stable?","John Gerspach","Well we think it's a growth business and again if you measure it in revenue John it's a little hard and I think we touched on this a little bit in Investor Day. It's a difficult business to measure just based upon revenue growth only because with so many of the partner relationships that we have we end up with performance sharing agreements and those performance sharing agreements, now the accounting for that all runs through revenue. So your revenue as your NCLs go up or down that impacts the performance of the business, that ends up in your revenue number. So that's why over time you might only look at that as being a 1% revenue growth business. But we like the growth aspects on pretax earnings. So we think it's a really good business and unfortunately with those performance sharing arrangements that tend to obscure the true revenue trends and even in the near-term economics we end up having to build the loan loss reserves for all the NCL's that we're going to incur in that business even though some of those NCLs ultimately as they\u2019re realized will go into the performance sharing arrangement and so it's actually our partners that will actually bear a significant percentage of those NCLs. ","John McDonald","Got it, got it, so the pretax is the best way to track that?","John Gerspach","That -- I would say the best measure is probably pretax earnings less the LLR.","John McDonald","Got it, okay thanks guys. ","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. ","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. ","Michael Corbat","Hey Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Hey John, just a clarification, did you say that you expect NII to see an additional growth of 500 million in the fourth quarter?","John Gerspach","I did, year-over-year.","Jim Mitchell","Oh, year-over-year.","John Gerspach","We expect year-over-year growth to be $500 million in the quarter. If you remember Jim when we, as we've been talking about growth in net interest revenue year-over-year we've been focused on that core accrual line and we said that in the second half of the year we would expect that to grow about a billion dollars year-over-year and we saw a $450 million in the third quarter and we're looking at $500 million in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re roughly in line with that billion dollars that we talked about back in July.","Jim Mitchell","Right, okay, fair enough. Maybe sticking with sort of NII maybe a little bit of a longer-term outlook in cards, your net interest margin there which you have obviously gone on through in detail and what\u2019s been impacting is, I think you are down about 8.6% this quarter. A year ago it was closer to 9.4%. When do we start to see or if you have a sense of when that starts to flatten in, can you get back to that 9% plus number over time?","John Gerspach","Well we opened a number that we settle on, is going to be really determined based upon the overall portfolio mix between the branded proprietary portfolio, the co-brand cards, and everything else. So I don't want to give you a long-term target on the average yield. We have given you the target that we believe that branded cards in the medium term should produce about 215 basis points of ROA and that includes yield assumption, that includes our forward look of NCL rate of 300 to 325 basis points. I don't want to start giving guidance Jim on every little line item that comprise the cards performance. ","Jim Mitchell","But we can ask anyway. And maybe just one question on the capital return. It looks like you did about a third of your total CCAR number in the quarter, it seemed obviously a little bit of a faster pace which you front loaded it a little bit. Does that imply that there's a little more flexibility with the Fed in terms of doing more up front, how do we think about your flexibility if you see an opportunity to buy stock, can do more than just a quarter's worth in a quarter? ","John Gerspach","When banks file their capital plans, the capital return is approved not just based upon the full year but it actually is quarter by quarter. So we have to lay out what our estimated capital returns will be for each quarter and then we need to live within that whole budget for each quarter. So we've got some flexibility but it has to be within the quarterly numbers that we have told the Fed that we're planning for.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, got it. Thanks. ","John Gerspach","No problem, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning. ","Michael Corbat","Hey, Brian. ","Brian Foran","Just maybe a last one on this consumer credit issue, I mean when we looked at the medium term global consumer banking net loss rate you gave at Investor Day of 2.20 to 2.40, is everything you're seeing right now not just in retail card but pulling up across all the businesses is still consistent with that ranges, some of this pushing the range, what would be your mark-to-market on that to 2.20 to 2.40 guidance?","Michael Corbat","You know the only thing that we've seen so far that would cause us to change any guidance would be in retail services where again we're guiding up from roughly 5% and then we had it in there a little bit higher than 5% to 5.10% to 5.25%. So, we are -- I haven't seen, to be honest with you Brian, I have not taken a look at how that, whether that drives us more towards the upper end of that guidance, it keeps us within that guidance though.","Brian Foran","Thanks and then maybe a question I get a lot, I know it's a little bit of a lost cause to forecast trading related NII -- I can't be forecasting rating so, but like why is it down across the whole industry not just you so much, is it just simply trading books are liability sensitive so, there's a little bit of give back there or why are we seeing these trade related NII numbers come under so much pressure?","John Gerspach","It has to do with the instruments that you're using in any given quarter to help position your clients appropriately, how you hedge, what instruments you used to hedge the position. And so some of the instruments that you use are mark-to-market instruments and therefore any change up or down in those instruments end up going into principle transactions and then mark-to-market revenues. If you're doing that by actually holding a security then to the extent that you've got a mark on that security, the mark would go into principle but interest that you actually accrue on that security goes to net interest revenue. So, trying to predict as you said trading related net interest revenue, good luck.","Brian Foran","If I could just one last one in equities and security services, I know both are areas where you\u2019ve invested for some time now, when you look at the recent momentum any sense of how much of that is market share and client gains versus how much of that is the backdrop?","John Gerspach","I'm sorry but you were breaking coming in and out, so in security services how much of it is market gains compared to actual client growth?","Brian Foran","No, in both equities and security services you had some nice momentum lately, any sense is that the payoff from the investment you\u2019ve versus I guess the tailwinds are really more in security services in terms of the market but just are these the payoffs we\u2019re seeing from your investments right now? ","John Gerspach","Yeah, certainly in both businesses we're seeing the growth that we've been hoping for. Security services we've had good underlying growth for six to eight -- six quarters now. But in the beginning part of this year and for most of last year then underlying growth has been masked by the impact of some businesses, some product portfolio that we had sold early in 2016. And so we lapped that impact in the first quarter of this year and that's why now the last two quarters, the real underlying growth rate that we\u2019re getting out of security services is coming through. And again we consider that to be similar to TTS, a foundational type of business in order to grow good in this case investor client relationships. So we think that's a terrific business and you're now able to see I think more clearly the momentum that we have there. And you know when it comes to equities, Mike?","Michael Corbat","On the equity side we will get the most recent quarterly numbers but I think the last numbers I saw had year-to-date equity wallet down revenue, down about 5%. Again we're up year-to-date somewhere in the 4% and we think that continues to come from share gains. ","John Gerspach","And I think the nice thing also you need to take a look at are we making progress with equities, I really think -- we are talking about, we try to gauge the progress that we're making in building the client franchise. And so in order to really gauge I think the progress that we\u2019re making there, take a look at our secondary business combined with the primary equity business, the ECM business. And if you look at that -- the equities franchise revenues, the equity markets plus the ECM they totaled over a billion dollars this quarter and that's up 30% year-over-year. The ECM revenues are certainly up significantly versus the prior year, they virtually doubled and that's really because we will be able to generate about 170 basis points of wallet share gain this year. And that's all with corporate clients. So combining both elements of our equities franchise, we've got a growing and balanced business with good momentum going with both our corporate as well as our investor clients.","Brian Foran","Thank you both.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, yesterday the IMF named Citigroup one of nine banks that should have subpar profitability through 2019 and my question is at what point would you relax your assumption that Citi\u2019s restructuring is over. On the one hand the ROE is up year-over-year, certainly a lot higher than a few years ago, on the other hand third quarter ROE is 7.3%, you still have I am guessing around $46 billion of DTAs, why not consider more restructuring or what point would you do so?","Michael Corbat","So starting with the IMF report Mike, it's reported that the coverage is based on one chart that I think is on page 12 of the document. And there's no underlying analysis that we can find in terms of how they came to those numbers. So we don't understand how they reach their conclusions. We disagree with them, I think we very clearly laid out our return of targets during an Investor Day and I think as today's results show, year-to-date results show we're making progress against those targets and we remain confident in terms of reaching them. ","In terms of the restructuring we declared the restructuring over but again as you can see in the numbers today and the numbers year-to-date that what we said is while the restructuring is over our focus around expense discipline stays and you\u2019ve seen operating expenses in the quarter down 2% year-over-year flat. So, that's in spite of the investments that we've talked about being funded in there. So again that discipline is not something that we've let slip away and that's a discipline that I expect we'll continue to keep as we go into the future. So we feel that what the quarter talks about, what year-to-date talks about is the balance and breadth of revenue growth and you can see the positive operating leverage across really almost all our business lines. You can see the revenue growth that's there. You can see the expense discipline and again you can you see that not only on a quarterly basis but you see it on a year-to-date basis and John talked about our expectations into quarter four. ","Mike Mayo","And one follow up, I mean the first page of the press release in the third quarter and the prior two quarters now highlight ROTCE excluding DTA. Why not instead of excluding DTA try to use the DTA more quickly through sales of assets. Is there anything else that you can do or you think maybe you should do under certain circumstances to sell appreciated assets to the level of DTA's declines and your ROTCE without any adjustments would increase? ","Michael Corbat","No, as we've talked in the past, that's something that we look at, again we try and manage the DTA carefully because that is your capital, we want to give back to you and we're not going to make either uneconomic or short-term decisions. And again we think based on what we've got approved this year and what we'll be looking to get approved into the future we've got a lot of capital to return today and we've got a lot of capital to return into the future and we are very focused on that. ","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I think you guys have stopped disclosing the legal repositioning costs earlier this year, but I was wondering if you can give us a sense of how meaningful they were, and what I am getting at is, I am trying to figure out how much of the positive operating leverage as we are looking year-over-year is coming from some of those drives going away and obviously it's sustainable when they go away I think as you mentioned the restructuring being done, but trying to figure out how much of the operating leverage that you point to has come from those going away and how much is kind of benefits still to come from further reductions in those buckets?","Michael Corbat","And you said Matt, we stopped doing those line item disclosures but I think right now from year-to-date legal and repositioning has been running about maybe a little bit under 150 basis points of revenue. And so I think going into the year we had said that our anticipation would be that it would be about 200 basis points. So we've gotten a little bit of a lift out of the reduction in the level of legal and repositioning that we've had. And I think it's probably about where we finish the year, it is somewhere at or just below 150 basis points of revenue for legal and repositioning.","Matt O'Connor","And then in the three year outlook you provided at Investor Day I think it implied a modest drop in expenses over the next three years, I assumed that's going to be one of the drivers in addition to general efficiency efforts?","Michael Corbat","Well, to the extent that we get to a more normal level of legal and repositioning, yeah. I don't think that it's a big driver, it's one factor that clearly is in there. But in any given year you're still going to have some level of repositioning cost in legal which I think every company has and that's why it's just part of their overall expense base.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, I just think -- I do think it would be helpful to break it out because if we look year-to-date you have about 300 basis points of positive operating leverage if I adjust out some of the gains to about 200 basis points, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is from kind of just one offs going away and that helps I think give confidence in getting to 400 basis points of operating leverage that you are looking forward to going forward?","John Gerspach","Well, when we go back to the Investor Day charts we tried to give you a sense as to over the timeframe that we were talking about that clearly the wind down of legacy assets and think all of that is now in Corporate\/Other. It is certainly going to be one of the factors that gets us to the expense profile that we put in there. It's one of the wind down of legacy assets depresses revenues, and it also serves to depress expenses. So we tried to give you a sense as to the revenue and expense growth that we're going to be getting out of the core businesses and then where we saw Corp\/Other, those legacy assets also play a role.","Matt O'Connor","Yeah, okay, thank you. ","John Gerspach","Alright.","Operator","Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks, I wanted a very small minor item but when you look at your security gains you've had about $200 million per quarter, as rates are kind of generally moving higher just to know if you were trying to reposition or do some things in that particular portfolio by taking those gains. So it is about five quarters in a row that you've actually taken gain, so I just was wondering what your Alco stance was there?","Michael Corbat","You know, we're always rebalancing the portfolio and so you are always going to get some level of security gains. It's not something that we do to try to generate the gain, it's just an outcome of balancing where we are in the books to where we -- how we want to position them for the future.","Marty Mosby","And then when we look at the -- okay go ahead. ","Michael Corbat","So as I said, it's an outcome not a target. ","Marty Mosby","Got you, and then when we look at the overall operating earnings per share we\u2019re still in this 1.25, 1.30 range, $1.25 to $1.30 range but yet shares are down 7%. I look at the institutional business, its revenues are actually up so it\u2019s not really volatility related to discompression in that particular business. You saw a lot of momentum in other pieces of the business which means that there has to be some, legacy assets that are still running off, some divestitures or businesses. These things are still kind of creating a drag that's not allowing you to really push earnings up even though we are seeing the benefit from capital. So when do we get to that inflection point and start to see some of the positives accrue to -- for the growth?","Michael Corbat","You know Marty as we laid out in Investor Day, that\u2019s certainly is something that we are still seeing in 2017. And as we get further into 2018, 2019 and 2020 those forces become less and we also expect to get a greater contribution from the global consumer business towards driving that earnings growth. And so it's a combination of completing the wind down legacy assets and as you know there is a lot less of those legacy assets than there were. We're down to when we stopped disclosing holdings we were down to about $54 billion of assets and its -- if I could find holding again it would be somewhere around $40 billion of assets now. But it's still something that is dragging. We're still supporting some of the businesses that we sold with transition service arrangements. So that is going to be something that colors our results for a little bit but, as we move forward and we continue to get the sequential growth in global consumer and now you have seen two consecutive quarters of growth in pretax earnings in global consumer and we fully expect that fourth quarter to be another quarter where we get sequential growth. And we also expect that the fourth quarter is when we get global consumer to year-over-year growth and that is certainty then going to be a contributor to growth in EPS in 2018 and beyond.","Marty Mosby","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jeffries.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Mike I want to ask you a question going back to your opener, we've seen the metrics on the global growth start to improve mid single-digits year-over-year consumer and in some of the institutional businesses and I just want to a lot of enthusiasm for the emerging markets rebound that we've seen broadly speaking, you mentioned that the potential for the global disruption, can you just talk us through just like business momentum in the non-U.S. markets and maybe just touch on a couple of the biggest ones as well just to give us an understanding of kind of where we are in terms of that just organic growth improvement and where you might be worried about a little bit of a pause?","Michael Corbat","Sure. So I think as you look around the world today and if you look at the forecast being put out in terms of 2018 at the top level right now growth is predicted to improve both in the developed and developing markets. But the developing markets, emerging markets are supposed to improve so, growth rates right now in the emerging markets probably came in somewhere just under 4% in 2016. We see a number probably somewhere around 4.5% in 2017, and we see forecast of around 4.75% going into 2018. Developed markets we probably were somewhere around 1.5% last year. Forecast are just bit above 2% this year, and I think we start to bump up hopefully towards 2.5% next year and if we get tax reform here in the U.S. obviously that'll act as a catalyst to those numbers. ","So, and if you look around the globe you've got most economies doing better and so that's the backdrop by which you would look at and judge things. And so again the relationship of the emerging markets growing faster than the developing markets stay in place. Again if you get tax reform, you get a catalyst to that. And it seems that we look at and you just can't ignore obviously, I talked in my opening about some of these things that are out there, that the markets and we have seen businesses just work their way through and obviously the North Korea situation will be one of those. And so again you've got challenges out there that at some point could start to weigh on the mind set, the pace of investment, the pace of business activity. We haven't seen it to date but it's not to say that it couldn't manifest itself in some ways. ","We've obviously also had the near-term challenges of a lot of natural disasters. And whether that's been hurricanes or earthquakes or flooding damages that it comes as a result of some of those things, those things will have a near-term impact in terms of what growth will look and feel like. But probably as we've seen historically in some ways those actually end up being a stimulus in the longer-term in terms of those monies that come back in the form of aid and investment and in rebuilding. And that's our expectation that we would probably see that occur again.","Ken Usdin","Got it, alright, thank you for that. And if I could just ask one follow up, just a moving picture with regards to the Reg reform and the tax reform potential, I guess more so on the Reg reform where it seems like the conversation is potentially louder, what are your kind of updated thoughts and hopes in terms of what might be most beneficial to Citigroup?","Michael Corbat","You go back and look at it again. Excellent piece of work that was done was the treasury report that was put out in June and we would describe that is largely consistent with what certainly our expectations and I think the broader markets or broader banking system expectations were. And what you've seen is consistent conversation with the broadly defined administration around going after that important pieces that are now starting to come into place or starting to get some key personnel. So we've obviously just seen Randy Quarles confirmed into the Fed Supervisory seat. That's important to get him in place. We've got a confirmation hopefully happening soon in terms of getting the permanent comptroller of the currency at the OCC. We will have the seat turning over at the FDIC. And then as you start to get these in place hopefully they can get together and start to affect some of the changes there. But again as we've talked about none of this or the vast majority of it doesn't require any legislative or legal changes to existing rules or law. And it's in many ways the tone from the top and the prioritization of the agencies which again is as we've said, we think it's constructive for the banking and business environment.","Ken Usdin","Got it, alright. Well, we'll see how that evolves. Thanks a lot Mike. ","Michael Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning guys. Couple of questions, one just a clarification on the efficiency ratio target, the 58% does that exclude or include the 600 million or the 580 million gain that you have booked this quarter. My understanding was that it excluded it but I just wanted to make sure that's still the case?","Michael Corbat","Well, the target that we set at the beginning of the year it includes all the expenses and all the revenue that we have when you take a look at how that $580 million gain is going to impact us. We're talking basis points on that ratio so whether we come in at 57.9% or 58.1% that to me is 58%. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, I mean fair enough. Okay, fair enough, the second question on the overall health of the consumer, you talked about moving up your loss ratios from 470 million to 500 million and the longer-term changing, we are seeing increases in losses in an environment where you do have a very strong labor market, unemployment coming down. It does really feel like there is maybe a two speed consumer with established households doing well and younger demographics, millennials, middle income folks not doing so well. So I'm curious as to how you're feeling just more broadly about the health of the consumer overall especially if we do start to see at some point down the line in the coming years some change in the labor market environment and do you think there is some risk in the medium-term to the losses, the expectations that you have in some parts of your consumer business?","John Gerspach","So I would say it is not just in the U.S. but as we look around the world we would rate the health of the consumer right now is pretty good. And again so you touched on a number of the most important things, so when you look at a consumer what are the things you look at, does the consumer have a job. If they have a job are they going to keep it, if they don't have a job how difficult is it to get one. And I think as you look across the world unemployment, slow employment is high. Probably the bigger challenge to the consumer or to the worker has been the lack of wage growth and again not just in the U.S. but in many places. And we're beginning to see some of that and again that's helping to the consumer. ","The other pieces when we look at the consumer and again when we go back to the crisis and know what we know from there, very hard to have an engaged consumer. In the U.S. the consumer accounts for about two thirds of the U.S. economy, very difficult to engage a consumer when housing prices are going down. And again what we've seen not just here in the U.S. but in many places there's a fairly steady consistent rise or at a minimum good stability to housing prices and I think the combination of jobs, a little bit of wage growth, stable housing, and rising asset prices has left the consumer in a pretty good place. Obviously we are a long way or we're a long way from the last credit cycle and so we're always challenging ourselves in terms of where we are. But a lot of the signs we looked for in terms of the deterioration of the consumer I got to say right now, we just don't see and if you go and look at our NCL rates and look at our delinquency rates around the globe from the document we've given you, again the numbers don't point to it.","Saul Martinez","Okay, fair enough, thanks for the response.","Operator","Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes, thank you. Just one quick follow-up question, hi, just one quick follow-up. Thank you so much for your very robust answers on card. Totally acknowledged that you told Jim that the cards deals from here really will depend on the mix. I'm wondering just from a timing perspective, is there a way for us to measure you know when these promotional balances would be potentially rolling off and you know be fully on the full yield, is there's a bit of a timing that we could think about?","John Gerspach","You know in general the promotional balances while the range of offers vary, they did you go up to 21 months. No, I don't want -- don\u2019t freak out, that does not mean that it\u2019s going to be 21 months before we see growth in anything. But it\u2019s just that going into this year we shifted our mix of acquisitions away from rewards towards promotional balances. It doesn't mean that we won\u2019t shift back again. Now the one thing that we know about cards is in trying to build this balanced portfolio with the balance business we're going to need to make adjustments as we go along every quarter. And so I just don't want to give specific guidance Erika as far as what month or how long, we do think again we are going to get sequential growth again this quarter. And we'll keep you apprised as to how we think we are doing overall with our targets on branded cards.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. Quick question on Equifax. I believe you're one of the users of Equifax and then you partner with them maybe a little bit more than some of the other credit bureaus and just wanted to get a sense from you as to any change that you're making with regard to that relationship post breach? And also understand is there anything different that you do on the retail partner card side, you know given that point of sale is one of the ways you acquire customers?","John Gerspach","And so you're right, we do use the services of Equifax but we've got to say that while this one is of a significant magnitude, data breaches aren\u2019t new and us having to work with and work around out data breaches I think for us and others are said to become fairly embedded in our business. When you think about the risk that we bear we're really bearing two types of risks when incidents like this occur, one is the authentication risk. So is somebody presenting the credentials, are they actually that person or that entity. And I think we feel that we've got ways of working with different technologies to authenticate and obviously we flagged those accounts and we know and we go on heightened alert to watch this. ","The second form of risk is the acquisition risk and that is that if somebody comes in through the application process, are they actually who they say they are. And that in itself is challenging and probably causes or does cause us to go through more steps of making sure that that's them. So one is we would go back, we would flag the file, and we would go back and be required to do extra levels of work against that. And from that the natural question is what's the ramifications on near-term, longer-term formation of credit and I would say in the first instance I think we've got the ability to authenticate pretty quickly. I think in the second instance it does slow the process down. And again some people have been locking their accounts within Equifax, that makes it a bit more challenging. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily material in terms of the slowdown but it does slow the process down just a bit.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, and then just a question on the expense ratio. I know you just had a discussion on that. It looks to me like you came in pretty firmly below your guidance on the expense ratio. Good thing this quarter maybe 70 basis points or so below what you had been expecting and I'm just wondering if there's anything as we look forward to 4Q that would suggest that that trajectory of coming in below expectation is changing, is there anything special about fourth quarter we should be considering, why not just keep that expense ratio improvement going?","Michael Corbat","We targeted the full year at 58% and that's where we expect to come in, at that 58%.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, alright, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning John. ","John Gerspach","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I have a question, obviously and I don't mean to sell short the efforts you have made in capital markets because you've done a great job in investing in your businesses and you showed us today like you did Investor Day gaining the wallet shift. But can you give us some color about competition because some of our bigger European competitors seem to still be struggling, are you able to take advantage and grow your market share as others haven't fully recovered like the American capital market players have?","John Gerspach","Again going back we focused a number of years ago around what we said growth is going to look and feel like for us is not a whole lot of new client acquisition. In fact we're doing more with less clients, more focused on our target clients, and growth is going to come in the form of taking market share both on the capital market side of things as well as on the banking side of things, and that's what we've done. And it's our expectation that we will continue to focus on taking share. And again I think the opportunities, we know having lived it when you go through restructuring and you go through changes to your business model how disruptive they can be. And I think actually with us taking the early actions and actually having of a lot of stability in our ICG franchise has served us well and we continue to want to be focused on that.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and could you guys give us some color, you had good growth this quarter in corporate lending both sequentially and year-over-year, was it here in the States or outside the States that you saw better growth in the corporate lending business within ICG?","John Gerspach","You know, I would say Gerard that it is -- it varies by product. Private banking where loans have been strong, private banking lending in both the U.S. and in Asia, but primarily in the U.S. when it comes to trade loans we have seen some good growth pretty much in Asia again in trade loans as well as some things here in the States. And it's been a nice mix across the place.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and I apologize if you've already addressed this, how does the backlogs look for the upcoming quarter in terms of the capital markets activity and investment banking?","John Gerspach","You know we normally don't give too much guidance on the backlog but I think that you've seen that in the forward guidance that we've given towards the fourth quarter where we sort of said the investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter we expect to be pretty much on where we were in the third quarter.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and then just lastly obviously you and your peers have all given us very good guidance this quarter on the weakness and trading particularly in the FIC marketplace. Can you share with us there has been a real surge in these non-bank liquidity providers, they obviously have incredible technology and algorithm type trading, companies like XTX Markets or Citadel Securities. Now granted they focus their efforts on the very liquid markets that are lower margin like the G10 rates or currencies, do you guys see these guys as bigger competitors now than a couple of years ago or any color in that specific area of capital markets?","Michael Corbat","I don't have the statistics to that but a couple of names you mentioned there are pretty good competitors. But again as we look in there, we've been taking share. I can't speak to their shares in the market but again when you look at our numbers we've been consistently taking share and we've been taking share in many of the areas they operate. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you Mike, I appreciate it.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Jeffrey Harte","Good morning guys. Most of the questions have been hit but I have a couple left. One, looking at North American credit cards, the profitability maybe a little more challenged than you initially thought it would be, like the branded card are away, kind of target coming down a little bit. This has been an area you\u2019d been really investing and looking to for growth over the last year, does that impact your focus on North American cards as an area of growth, the reduction in profitability versus what you are initially expecting?","John Gerspach","No, I mean Jeff when we got to the Investor Day we talked about the fact that the ROA was going to come down from 2.25 down to like 2.15. Again it's not a -- it's a tweak more than anything else and it was more reflective of a rebalancing of just the fact that we had a lot of the co-brand just growing faster than what we had thought was going to happen, so some of that is just a product of our own success. ","But we still think of cards as being a healthy part of our business but it's not the only engine for growth that we have. It's the first area that we talked about only because the investments that we made in branded cards were so visible, when you think about the early investment that we made in the proprietary portfolios we got into that whole rewards and rebates area and so you know that you're just taking a big drop down in your profitability. It's very, very visible, it's not quite the same as hiring a few more people in equities markets. These things were big and so we needed to really make sure that we talked about them and that you understood where we were going. ","But I think the nice thing is that we've developed many engines of growth right now. If you take a look at what's going on in the rest of North America, the launch of the Citigold platform, we now have retail banking revenues excluding mortgages which again we change our strategy on that. But the retail banking revenues up 12% year-over-year, yes, that is getting a little bit a lift from interest rates but it still is good growth. We've had our Citigold Wealth Management clients increase by 28% year-to-date. You can see the assets under management growing by 10%. So we've got a nice a nice growth coming out of retail banking in the U.S. ","We've got on the international five consecutive quarters now of positive revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both consumer Asia and consumer Mexico. You see the engines for growth that we built in the ICG and these are all client-led businesses. TTS, security services, private bank 15%, that's two -- that's a couple of quarters now we've had double digit growth in the private bank. So while branded cards was the first engine for growth that we talked about publicly we've built a whole series of engines for growth that we're really excited about and that we try to lay out for everybody on Investor Day. I mean we're still focused on growing that branded cards business but it's not the only engine for growth that we have either in consumer or for Citi.","Jeffrey Harte","Okay, and maybe taking a second leg off of that. The international versus the North American businesses in general, I mean part of the argument for Citi I think has always been exposure to international especially emerging market kind of some of the consumer businesses that nobody else can really match. So we've really kind of seen North America growing better than some of the international recently, can you talk a bit to when or will the kind of international business start to outgrow the North American business some, especially in kind of in the wake of how much you downsized your geographic presence there?","John Gerspach","Yes Jeff, I think you may be getting caught up just a bit in the inorganic growth that we had in North America from the Costco portfolio because we actually like the organic growth that we've been getting now in Asia and in Mexico. In both -- like in Mexico a little bit -- revenues grew a little bit lighter this year this quarter than we would have liked but that seems to be something that's cutting across the industry. We have deposits we\u2019re growing but now in Mexico what we've got now is we have actually finished the repositioning of the cards book, we worked our way out of that J curve type of thing. And now we've got cards revenues in Mexico that are actually have growth year-over-year. So we think that the growth prospects for Mexico are pretty good. ","Investor Day we said our anticipation is compound annual growth rate in revenues of 10%, we had been running at about 7% to 8%, we will probably be back to that 7% to 8% in the fourth quarter and then we should continue to grow into 2018 and 2019. Asia again we've got the cards business there now generating nice growth. We're starting to get growth in some of the retail lending. We like the wealth management business that we've got in Asia and again in both of those businesses five consecutive quarters of revenue growth and positive operating leverage. We think that's the way that you build a nice sustainable growth pattern by being able to grow revenues as you're generating positive operating leverage. ","And then in North America, again we will take a look, branded cards is coming along a little bit slower than we had thought but still coming along nicely. And I talked about the retail banks so I think we've got really three good engines for growth in the future there in the consumer business.","Jeffrey Harte","Okay. Thank you.

Actual results, and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Susan, thank you; and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $181 million for the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement CVA and DVA, net income was $3.9 billion, up slightly from last year or $1.24 per share. ","Before I get into our operating performance I want to discuss our legacy mortgage settlement. The comprehensive settlement announced today with the U.S. Department of Justice, the State AGs and the FDIC resolves all pending civil investigations related to our legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring and issuance activities. We also have now resolved substantially all of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigation. We believe that this settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future in serving our clients.","During this quarter, our institutional businesses performed well outside of markets where macro uncertainty and historically low volatility reduced client activity clearly impacting our fixed income and equities revenues. Corporate investment banking revenues strengthened, led by strong equity and debt underwriting and our treasury and trade solutions businesses again saw underlying revenue growth as volumes continued to increase. ","In consumer banking, year-over-year comparisons continue to be affected by lower mortgage refinancing activity and our repositioning efforts in Korea. But we believe these businesses have now stabilized and we're better positioned for growth in the second half of the year. We grow our consumer loans despite the uneven economic environment and saw continued signs of progress in our U.S. cards business. ","Excluding the settlement announced today, Citi Holdings turned to profit for the first time since its formation and we announced agreements to sell our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which will further reduce holdings assets in the third quarter. The holdings profit actually helped drive DTA consumption which totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter and $2.2 billion for the first half of 2014. And despite the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement on our net income, our capital position strengthened to a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.6% on a Basel III basis and our tangible book value also increased. ","During the first half of this year we generated $10 billion in capital despite today\u2019s settlement. Throughout the organization we're focused on strengthening our capital planning process, improving our execution and increasing our efficiency; we're engaged in a firm-wide effort that includes improving our target client model, streamlining our structure, processes and technology platforms and optimizing our real estate footprint. ","These actions create a capability to make investments in our business, regulatory and compliance activities and strength in our capital planning process. They also allow us to reduce our operating expenses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. ","","While this effort is on-going, we are already making some good headway. For example, during the second quarter, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by 3,500 people to 244,000 and it is now down nearly 7,000 for the first half of 2014 and 15,000 people since the fourth quarter of 2012. We continue to simplify our product offerings and we further rationalized our footprint, shrinking retail branches by nearly 140 while reducing consumer support sides by another 31 locations. ","","Looking ahead, for the second half of this year, I feel good about how we're positioned and I believe we should see an improved revenue picture. On the consumer side, the U.S. economy is gaining strength as job creation and consumer spending increases. Internationally, our franchise is performing well and we believe the headwinds facing our retail business in Korea are abated.","","In our institutional business, while client activity has been lower in markets, business such as investment banking and trade finance are showing momentum. We\u2019ve also demonstrated the ability to reduce the drag of Citi Holdings and utilize DTA, both of which will contribute to the strengthening of our capital positions going forward.","","John will now go through the deck and then we will be happy to take your questions. John?","","John Gerspach","","Okay, thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First as Mike described, this quarter, we took a $3.7 billion after-tax charge related to the mortgage settlement for a negative impact on EPS of a $1.21 per share; and second, CVA and DVA was a negative $33 million pre-tax this quarter or $0.01 per share after tax compared to a positive 477 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of last year.","","Adjusting for CVA, DVA and the impact of the settlement, we earned $1.24 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.25 per share in the second quarter of last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation, I\u2019ll be discussing our results excluding these two items to provide comparability to prior periods.","","On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We are in $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $8.1 billion for the first half of 2014, both up slightly from prior periods as lower revenues were offset by lower operating expenses and a decline in credit cost. Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $668 billion as 8% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings and deposits grew 3% to $966 billion. ","","On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related costs were roughly $400 million in the second quarter, mostly incurred in Citicorp. Repositioning costs were also around $400 million, including approximately $270 million of repositioning costs related to our consumer franchise in Korea. ","","Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter declined by over $225 million in constant dollars, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth. Sequentially, core expenses were down versus last quarter, reflecting lower incentive compensation and continued efficiency efforts, again partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost. ","","On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 18% year-over-year as lower revenues and higher legal and repositioning costs were partially offset by lower core operating expenses and an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we earned over $240 million this quarter, compared to a loss of nearly $600 million last year.","","Citi Holdings revenues increased significantly from last year driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Core expenses continue to decline in line with a 15% year-over-year reduction in assets. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $111 billion of assets or 6% of Citi Group assets. ","","Turning to Citi Corp on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning cost also increased 1% from the prior year, driven by business growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by on-going efficiency savings. Including legal and repositioning cost, total operating expenses increased 12% from the prior year, mostly due to the repositioning charges in Korea.","","International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of certain markets. Korea remained a headwind year-over-year, however the franchise was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and we believe we should begin to see sequential revenue growth in Korea as we go into the second half of the year. ","Aside from Korea, the most significant challenge for Asia consumer revenue this quarter was a decline in investment sales revenues both year-over-year and sequentially. While this business has grown over time, quarterly investment sales revenues tend to reflect the overall capital markets environment and in the second quarter we saw a weaker investor sentiment.","We provide more details on Asia consumer revenues on appendix slide 25. Despite these headwinds most underlying drivers remain positive with average loans up 7% and average deposits up 3% from last year. International credit cost grew 10% year-over-year mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning in Latin America while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at below 200 basis points.","Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.2 billion declined by 26% from last year mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 3% sequentially as higher mortgage revenues and improved deposit spreads offset the absence of a onetime $70 million gain in the prior quarter.","Branded cards revenues of 2 billion were up 3% versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances. And retail services revenues grew 7% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. On-going cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down by 4% year-over-year to 2.3 billion even after absorbing the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the second quarter, taking cost out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint all while continuing to grow our franchise. Over the past 12 months, we have sold or closed over 70 branches in North America. During the same period, we grew average retail loans by 11% and average deposits by 4% including 11% growth in checking account balances.","In branded cards, we also saw momentum while total average loans have continued to decline modestly, this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. Full rate balances have growth year-over-year for five consecutive quarters, reflecting account growth and increased card usage primarily in our proprietary rewards and travel co-brand products including American advantage where new account growth for our executive card has exceeded our expectations.","Credit remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving more than what we had anticipated in branded cards and retail services contributing to a loan loss reserve release of nearly $400 million. At quarter end, our loan loss reverses in North America cards represented roughly 16 months of concurrent NCL coverage.","Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America, the strong credit trends I just mentioned drove an improvement in our outlook and we now anticipate the full year NCL rate to be roughly in line with first half results or slightly better than our previous estimate of around 3%. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates.","These trends were driven primarily by Mexico cards as that portfolio continued to season and consumers continued to adjust to fiscal reforms as well as the impact of slower economic growth. We continue to expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with first half levels. This rate could be higher of course if we incur any losses related to our exposure to homebuilders in Mexico; however, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserves and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.","Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, in addition we encouraged significant repositioning charges in Korea in the second quarter creating a drag on our reported operating efficiency.","Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio to just under 54% as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations. Slide 11, shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Legal and repositioning costs were elevated in the second quarter driven by Korea, while core operating expenses continued to decline. We expect to make further progress in reducing core expenses in the second half of the year as we remain on track to achieve or exceed our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification and branch and support side rationalization.","Turning now to the institutional clients\u2019 group on slide 12; revenues of $8.5 billion declined 7% from last year and 8% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion grew 6% from last year and 9% from the prior quarter. Excluding the one-time $50 million gain in the prior year, treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 3%, both year-over-year and sequentially as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression.","Investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were up 16% from last year and 27% from the prior quarter, driven by particularly strong debt and equity underwriting activity. M&A revenues improved from the prior quarter and we continue to increase our share of announced M&A volumes in a growing market. Private bank revenues of $656 million grew 2% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression and were down 2% sequentially on lower capital markets activity.","Core lending revenues were $454 million, up from prior periods mostly due to higher average loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion declined 12% from last year as historically low volatility and continued macro uncertainty dampened investor client flows particularly in rates and currencies. In addition, the prior year period benefited from gains as we paired back risk positions given increased volatility in emerging markets. ","Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 22% reflecting seasonal trends. Equities revenues of $659 million were down 26% year-over-year and 25% sequentially reflecting lower client activity, as well as weak trading performance in EMEA in part driven by macro and geopolitical uncertainties in the region.","In securities services revenues were roughly flat versus last year as increased client activity was offset by a reduction in high margin deposits and up 7% sequentially due to increased client balances and higher activity from new accounts.","Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were down 2% versus the prior year driven by lower incentive compensation partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost and legal and related expenses in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses decreased by over a $100 million mostly reflecting lower incentive compensation.","On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12 month basis we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 66% two years ago to 60% as of the second quarter, even as the revenue environment has remained challenging. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29% consistent with the full year of 2013.","Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher, legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance cost. Assets of $326 billion included approximately $104 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $167 billion of liquid investment securities.","On slide 15 shows Citi Holdings\u2019 assets which totalled $111 billion at quarter-end, with roughly 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter mostly driven by net pay downs. Roughly $3.8 billion of asset sales were in process during the quarter, but not yet closed as of June 30. These include $2.7 billion of assets from the announced sale of our retail operations in Spain and Greece, as well as nearly $1 billion of mortgage loans, each of which should close in the third quarter.","On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings\u2019 financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.5 billion were up year-over-year primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Citi Holdings\u2019 expenses decreased significantly with core operating expenses down 15% in line with the reduction in assets. Net credit losses continued to improve and we released $254 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages.","Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on Slide 17; the operating margin in Citi Holdings remained at roughly $700 million this quarter driven in part by gains on asset sales. Credit remained fairly stable and on an adjusted basis, legal cost declined significantly driving Citi Holdings to a profit in the second quarter.","On Slide 18, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.9 billion in the second quarter, up from last year on higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin and up sequentially driven by day count. Our net interest margin declined sequentially to 287 basis points in the second quarter driven by lower loan and investment yields partially offset by lower cost of funds. We currently believe our net interest margin should remain roughly flat to second quarter levels for the remainder of the year.","On Slide 19, we show our key capital metrics. Despite the impact of the settlement our Basel III tier one common ratio grew to 10.6% as we benefited from DTA utilization during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 5.7% and our tangible book value grew to $56.89 per share.","So in summary our results in the second quarter demonstrated further progress on several fronts, while markets revenues reflected the challenging environment, we showed continued momentum in our investment banking franchise and Treasury and Trade solutions continued to grow all while we continued to reduce our total expense base in ICG. ","On the consumer side we continued to grow loans, deposits and card purchase sales while reducing our core operating expenses and maintaining overall favorable credit performance. And in Citi Holdings excluding the impact of the settlement we achieved our first profitable quarter and we believe Citi Holdings should remain profitable for the remainder of this year, although with some variability quarter-to-quarter.","Looking to the second half of the year, in markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment. Although we would certainly anticipate that market conditions should be somewhat more favorable than in the second half of 2013. In investment banking revenues will also reflect the overall market, but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance not only in the second quarter but over the past year. And in Treasury and Trade solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues in the second half of the year driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds.","Turning to consumer banking; in North America we believe revenue should grow in the second half of the year, both versus the first half of 2014 as well as year-over-year with positive operating leverage. And in international consumer revenue should also grow in the second half of the year. As we move past our repositioning efforts in Korea and the underlying growth of the remaining franchise becomes more apparent.","Turning to expenses; in Citicorp our core operating expenses should continue to decline, although we expect to face on going higher regulatory and compliance costs. Repositioning expenses in the second half of the year should be roughly in line with the first half levels and legal cost will likely remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our credit performance, while we saw an increase in loan loss reserve releases in our North America cards business this quarter, driven better by better than anticipated credit performance. We do expect the reserve releases to be lower in the second half of the year and nominal credit costs in Citicorp could increase as we continue to grow our loan portfolios.","And finally we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be broadly in line with the first half in the range of 32%. And with that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","","John a few questions, yes, just wanted to follow up on a couple of things you just mentioned. On the legal cost would you expect with the settlement now taking a lot of the mortgage exposure off the table? I assume that legal cost would look more like this quarter where ex-CMBS settlement they seem to come in around 400 million rather than the prior trend which was closer to about 800 million?","John Gerspach","","Well, let me break it down this way John. I\u2019d say that with the legacy mortgage settlement behind us, we wouldn\u2019t expect holdings to have any significant level of legal charges in the second half of 2014. Now as I said, legal expenses in Citicorp that they are going to remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything significant.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And this quarter you had about 400 million in Citicorp in which you characterize that as still elevated to $400 million?","John Gerspach","","I would say that\u2019s elevated versus what would expect in a normal environment, so we will see where we will go at the second half of the year.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. And then I thought the repositioning expenses will be coming down in the second half of the year after the elevated charge this quarter for Korea. I thought you might have said that last quarter that they will be coming down after this. So, I thought you just said now that they would stay at the first half levels. What would be keeping the repositioning cost so high?","John Gerspach"," ","Well John, we continue to focus our efforts on our operations in the countries that we had identified as optimized markets. And matter of fact if you go back to the conference that we presented at near the end of May, we actually used the slide that showed that we had improved our efficiency ratio by over -- I think it was 300 basis points in those markets during 2013 and we generated further improvements during 2014 through a combination of efforts of branch closures, product rationalization, consolidation of operation and headcount reductions. And we're just going to continue that focus during the balance of this year and given that continued focus we just think it\u2019s more likely that the repositioning reserves for the second half are going to be much more in line with what we had in the first.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And you mentioned North America consumer expenses likely to improve some more, overall expenses on the core expense face of about 11 billion this quarter companywide. Do you hope to improve from there going forward?","John Gerspach"," ","We expect the core expenses to decline sequentially in each of the next two quarters. Obviously, some -- we won\u2019t get as much I think as everybody would like just because of the higher legal and regulatory cost that we're facing but we do anticipate continued sequential decline in the core operating expenses.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And just shifting gears to the DTA utilization. That was a big number this quarter, John and better than expected. The big settlement didn\u2019t seem to have an impact, is that because it wasn\u2019t tax deductible, could you just explain that?","John Gerspach"," ","You have got it, John. The lion\u2019s share of the cost, if you take a look, we talked about taking a pre-tax charge of 3.8 billion and an after tax charge of 3.7 billion, so to your point not much of the settlement cost was tax deductible. And so perhaps the best way to take a look at the performance in the quarter is looking at the results excluding the settlement and there you will see that I think in the first quarter we had $5.9 billion or so of pre-tax earnings and in the second quarter we have roughly the same amount. So, when you are dealing with that level of pre-tax earnings, you are going to get DTA utilization of again somewhere between 700 million, 800 million or 1.1 billion in the quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And that $1.1 billion this quarter contributed to $2.2 billion of Basel III capital build. Could you just explain that on page 36, you show out $1.1 billion led to $2.2 billion of increased Basel III capital?","John Gerspach"," ","Yes John that really is tied up in the multiplier effect and it\u2019s a very, very complicated formula that you've got to go through and take a look at not just the level of DTA but first of all what type of DTA. In both the first and the second quarter most of the DTA that we've been able to utilize, has come out of the FTC, those foreign tax credits. So, you start by, that\u2019s immediately dollar-for-dollar reduction because those things just come off the top. ","Then between the capital growth as well as the reduction that we've had in things like mortgage servicing rights, we've got even more room now in our 10% buckets as well as the overall 15% bucket. And so you just add up all the various multiplier effects and you end up with that $1.1 billion actually contributing $2.2 billion in regulatory capital.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Right, you got expansion of the cap, the dynamic cap. Last thing may be Mike, could you comment on the [indiscernible] or any update on the progress you are making understanding the fed\u2019s concerns and what they are asking you to improve and your confidence and the ability to satisfy the high qualitative bar that the regulators are setting?","Mike Corbat ","","Sure. What I would say, John, this is Mike, that there is really very little additional information beyond what we've said at the venues along the way but I think to summarize that we still are operating and feel strongly that this isn\u2019t an issue with our business model, our strategy, our levels of capital are clearly our ability to generate capital. Gene and the team are working to continue to enhance and where necessary, build the right (inclusive) [ph] processes in a range of scenarios around the firm. We feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the communication with the fed but its work in progress and we've got more work to do between now and year-end.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","A quick question may be just a follow-up on the legal side, you guys settled for $4.5 billion in cash and took a $3.8 billion charge, you only used up $700 million in reserves. Is that effectively a reserve build for what remains and that makes you feel a little bit better about your coverage going forward or is that -- are you only really have $700 million set aside for that, that issue.","","John Gerspach"," ","Here Jim, I\u2019m not going to comment on the reserve levels that we have set up for any individual litigation but in the math that you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve left out the cost of the consumer relief efforts and we do anticipate and have made provision for expense that we will incur in connection with those consumer relief efforts and so that, that estimate is also embedded in the $3.8 billion pre-tax charge that we took.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, so it\u2019s not just through reserves but also through expense. ","","John Gerspach"," ","Through the expense that we\u2019ve taken this quarter, yes.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, all right.","","John Gerspach"," ","You know Jim, we start with the $4 billion penalty, then you\u2019ve got the $500 million that we\u2019ll pay to the state AGs and the FDI Citi. You add to that the cost of the consumer relief, because there are hard dollar costs associated with the consumer relief efforts and then you subtract out the reserves that we have previously established and that would leave -- that\u2019s what leaves you with the $3.8 billion pre-tax number.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, fair enough, just a follow up on the expenses and targets, I think we\u2019ve obviously seen revenues come down quite a bit in capital markets year to date, I think you guys, as recently as early June at a conference have been sticking with your targets and I\u2019ve had some questions on how you guys get there with lower revenues, is this part of the reason why restructuring costs are going to remain higher because you\u2019re doing more on the expense side, so I guess they just want to see if that\u2019s right and if you feel still comfortable with your ROA and efficiency ratio targets given where you are right now.","","John Gerspach"," ","Yes, we\u2019re still committed to those targets for 2015 and you know as we said we\u2019re very focused on our execution efforts and in rationalizing the expense base in every one of our businesses.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","And so the weaker revenues don\u2019t give you pause.","","John Gerspach"," ","Well I mean, I don\u2019t want to be so cavalier about it, Jim to just say that we don\u2019t consider the weaker revenues but we\u2019ve taken all of that into consideration when we say that we\u2019re still committed to those targets.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right, right, okay. No, that\u2019s great, and one last question just on deposit growth, is that very good quarter deposit growth and see corporate Asia has lagged quite a bit in your international side, is that simply a function of Korea or is there something else going there much broad based across Asia that\u2019s limited deposit growth.","","John Gerspach"," ","No, as you know Jim, we\u2019re carefully managing deposit growth and we have been managing deposit growth for some time, you can\u2019t just manage deposit growth at the top of the house, you need to manage it in each country and frankly in each legal vehicle, and so as we look at the liquidity needs for each of our -- each of the countries in which we operate we\u2019re very focused on the level of deposits that we have and importantly the quality of those deposits. So you\u2019re going to see -- you\u2019ll see some regions where we have targeted higher deposit growth than others and it\u2019s really based upon the liquidity needs in each of those regions. ","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay so it\u2019s just you guys holding it back.","","John Gerspach"," ","Well, we\u2019re carefully managing deposits.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, that\u2019s all I got.","","John Gerspach"," ","You have to manage your balance sheet.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","No, I hear you, okay thanks, I appreciate it.","","John Gerspach"," ","Not a problem.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Hello there, quick in holdings, heard your comments about second half profitability which is cool, I\u2019m just curious, on the net interest revenue side, net interest revenues have increased last three quarters in a row but assets, loans and deposits are obviously shrinking with the whole run off, just curious on how that works.","","John Gerspach"," ","Well, we -- there\u2019s yield on assets and then there is cost of funds and we have been -- we\u2019ve been actively managing both sides of that equation, so when you take a look at it you start to lower your cost of funds as you run off assets and that produces the results that you\u2019re looking at.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","That makes sense to me on cost of funds, I\u2019m curious mechanically how that works, is that assigning the relative, meaning when the book is larger and they\u2019re less liquid, it gets a higher cost and as the book gets smaller and more liquid you get a better funding cost, is that the big sling in there, I mean I\u2019m -- it\u2019s like a 150 million, it\u2019s not enormous but it\u2019s just counter intuitive. ","","John Gerspach"," ","Well it\u2019s the type of funding that you have and the level and certainly the amount of funding that you have in each business as well and you know as the cost of that funding then goes down, you\u2019re going to get a benefit, I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, you know clearly some of the characteristics that you mentioned are driving characteristics, highly illiquid assets have a higher cost of fund -- cost more to fund than liquid assets, so as a book shifts from illiquid to more liquid you\u2019re going to see that we can therefore change the funding problem.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Yes, I\u2019m good with it, I appreciate it, same kind of com question, inside the equities business you mentioned some of the weaknesses was due to obviously lower volumes, the other part was I think I read a tagline on hedging on the Ukrainian side, produce part of the drop, can you just give a further comment I didn\u2019t see it in the release but I think I saw it online. ","John Gerspach"," ","Yes, no. In the second quarter, and again this is specific to the equities markets, the trading business. In the second quarter we had hedged our equities book in EMEA in anticipation of -- kind of a significant negative market reaction to the Russia, Ukraine situation. Now ultimately that did not materialize to the extent that we have planned for. And so as a consequence, our actions to de-risk the book actually resulted in realized losses during the quarter. So the realized losses that we took in lifting those hedges, equal to about 40% of the revenue decline in that product year-on-year. So we had a -- equities markets were down 26% year-over-year. And so that the de-risking activities actually contribute about 10 full percentage points to that decline.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Got it. Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then last one, in the FX business, I know this is a hard one, but the slowdown that we\u2019ve seen, the environment obviously volatility has fallen off dramatically, is there any way to tribute how much of that is cyclical obvious of just lower volatility, lower client volumes, lower revenues to changes that have taken place in light of the recent investigations in the market?","John Gerspach"," ","I think that\u2019s going to be really difficult to try to parse out.","Mike Corbat","It\u2019s Mike. And I would say couple of things, I think that, again when you think of our FX business there\u2019s a couple of components to it, which in some ways makes it different from others, one is, we\u2019ve got the big transaction processing business and money is coming through the pipes that we process in a regular basis. I think to your question where we\u2019ve seen the real slowdown is on the more active trading. And just that largely being as a result of the lower volatility. So I would view a lot of that as being largely cyclical. And I would expect as volatility comes back, some reasonable portion of that to come back with the volatility.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Just a question first of all on your reasonable and possible losses with respect to the obviously, the resolution of a lot of issues, can you give us a sense of what that might look like versus last quarter when the (Q) [ph] comes out?","John Gerspach","No Guy. We\u2019ll address that when we publish the (Q) [ph].","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay. Fair enough, thought I'd ask. I wanted to ask you question on the potential for the significant deposit movements in the probably foreseeable future at this point when the FED starts to move your short terms rate higher, it seems like the mechanics are going to be different than they have been in the past for all the reasons that we all know about. And I think we can say that there is a couple of schools of thought, as to what might happen when short term rates go up, one is deposits have really only shrunk a couple of times in the last century or so, it's always been very marginal, so not to worry. And then on the other hand JPMorgan has flagged their view kind of at the other end of the spectrum but maybe this time is different because of mechanics of what the FED\u2019s going to do will be so different and may require a drain of, the FED maybe trillion dollars of bank deposits. As you think about liquidity planning and your internal stress testing, is there anything that you can share with us about the range of best and worst case deposit growth that you might be thinking about?","John Gerspach"," ","Yes. I am not going to give you a range Guy, but I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019d say that, when you think about the potential impact of the FED\u2019s actions on deposits, one we\u2019re probably less exposed than others on this, don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve got of our $968 billion of deposits, it\u2019s just a little over $400 billion are domestic deposits. So it\u2019s not the biggest part of our book. And we, as I mentioned in response to one other question, we\u2019ve really been managing our deposit base very carefully over the last few years. And so I think the other thing you need to consider is the quality of an institutions deposit base. And I think that what we\u2019ve been able to achieve is an improvement in our quality of deposits, both internationally but specifically domestically, over the course of the last several years. ","We\u2019re much more focused on and much more concentrated in real operating accounts, we\u2019ve really driven down the level of time deposits that we have in the business. And importantly when you look at with some of the FED\u2019s actions, I think that they are more likely to impact deposits that people take in from financial institutions. And if you\u2019re managing your deposit base in connection with the LCR and NSFR rules, you\u2019re going to be lowering that deposit base anyway so you should be less susceptible to big deposit movements because when the LCR and the NSFR rules deposits associated with financial institutions you get very little if any, credit for the liquidity value of those deposits. So they really bring you nothing as far as managing your overall funding, your overall liquidity. So we\u2019ve been very focused on managing all the aspects of the deposit base over the past couple of years, both as to the nature of the deposits, the liquidity value of those deposits, and really trying to focus on core operating deposits in both retail and corporate customers.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. So the follow-up question was going to be how all of this might interact with LCR but it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that the LCR shouldn\u2019t change very much even with the kinds of flows that might be associated with that type of that activity because they would probably be low LCR credit deposits anyway?","John Gerspach"," ","Yes, it\u2019s going to be real interesting to see how the FED goes about the next level of managing as far as increasing rates because when you take a look at how monetary policy is going to interact with regulatory policy I think we\u2019re going to end up in a new world that none of us have lived through before nor has the FED.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Great. And then final question from me just on the core equity Tier 1 ratio that as you noted did pick up, that I believe is an advance calculation is that right? And if so, can you just tell us what the standardized was?","John Gerspach"," ","Yes, the number that we published is the advanced methodology because again our Tier 1 common ratio is lower under advanced and it is currently under standard. I don\u2019t have the standard in front of me Guy, but it\u2019s higher than what the advanced approach [indiscernible].","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, fair enough. And thanks for the (proponents) [ph] on the deposit outflows, that was very helpful.","John Gerspach"," ","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Couple of questions, one is on the op risks RWAs, you noticed you mentioned at bottom of page 19 that the op risk RWAs are flat Q-on-Q at 288 while for the last few quarters. And I guess I am just wondering does that imply that the kind of settlement that we just had this morning was reflected in your RWA outlook before?","John Gerspach"," ","That\u2019s our view Betsy that this settlement was already embedded in the increases that we took to the op risk risk weighted assets both in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, because then when we\u2019re looking at these articles that are out there and obviously we don\u2019t know how much is reflecting of your views but you went in with the lower bid for the settlement than the ultimate final settlement, so I am just trying to square that.","John Gerspach"," ","Well, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s a (combination) [ph] but usually impacts op risk is the overall industry more than a particular institution.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so you would have thought that like the numbers that you actually came out with was more relevant than what the initial ask was that you might have had for yourself. Is that the way to think about it?","John Gerspach"," ","The way to think about it is really the operational risk environment that the industry is facing and we think that that is really was already embedded in the 288 number.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then we\u2026","John Gerspach"," ","As of the end of the first quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then we also have a couple of more things that still need to get resolved obviously it's been in the headlines for a while, things like LIBOR and FX. And so would those also be embedded within this number as well?","John Gerspach"," ","Based upon everyone\u2019s current views as to what those could be.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Separate question on the Citicorp corporate other, its page 14. Just want to make sure I understand that expected sustainability of these numbers versus one timers in this quarter revenues down because of hedging activities, maybe to just understand what your thoughts are for that line item, how much did hedging activities impact that, would that have been more like 140 last quarter\u2019s revenue line?","John Gerspach"," ","Yes, I think when you take a look at corp other, you\u2019re going to get a variation around $100 million from quarter to quarter. Sometimes it will be a little bit less than a $100 million, sometimes it will be a little bit more than a $100 million.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, on the revenue side.","John Gerspach"," ","Correct.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And then on the expenses little bit of higher legal and regulatory compliance, I am just legal sounds like it\u2019s a one timer but reg compliance I am not sure if that\u2019s a one timer or FED just keeps going so how much of that you\u2019re thinking about the expense line now?","John Gerspach"," ","When you take a look at the first -- I'd take a look at the core operating expenses sequentially and if you look at them sequentially the 284 and the 297 are fairly close.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So legal and repo should fade over the next couple of years is that how to think about there?","John Gerspach"," ","Well, certainly repositioning as I said, repositioning cost overall for Citi should be -- the second half should be somewhat in line with what we had in the first half. And legal, as I said, I think that\u2019s going to remain elevated but it\u2019s also going to be somewhat episodic in nature.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And then just lastly on page 11, you have the consumer expense drivers and as of 2Q, in some cases, you've already exceeded what your year-end forecast is; does that suggest year-end forecast will be updated or we\u2019re just running ahead of schedule and the levers for the expense line in global consumer are largely around the support side at this stage?","John Gerspach","Yes, I'd say yes to everything you said. So when you look at some of the drivers, we are running ahead of where we thought we would be clearly on headcount. We didn\u2019t feel that we could update you with the new year-end target at this point in time. So we will likely give you a better view as to where we're going to be at year-end when we come back to you in the third quarter. But obviously it should be lower than the 145 that we are right now. As a matter of fact, if you look at the target we have said it\u2019s going to be less than 145. So if we get less than 145, we'll give you a sense as to how low we think we will be able to drive that next quarter. And I think as far as from a support side point of view that clearly is a big driver of expense in the consumer businesses and that is something that we're very focused on. Good progress in the second quarter, taking those support side down by about 30. And we hope to be able to do that and more in the third and fourth quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","And that\u2019s in part the benefit from the project Rainbow?","John Gerspach","In part, it\u2019s Rainbow, it\u2019s also -- we talked about in the past trying to run the consumer business as opposed to a collection of 35 individual consumer businesses, as more of a global consumer bank, and so that clearly has some aspect of it. But there\u2019s also aspect that we can do just in the U.S where in the U.S., we sort of ran the consumer business not as a bank, but as a collection of product silos. And so as we begin to run the U.S. more as a retail bank, that also gives us the ability to close down sites and consolidate.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, so there should be more income here on the expense outlook?","John Gerspach","That\u2019s what we're saying, yes. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Few questions, first, how much was the Ukraine hedging loss?","John Gerspach","Well, I didn\u2019t give you an exact dollar amount, Mike, but you can figure it out by the fact that I said it was -- it caused about 10%; so let\u2019s call it just slightly around $100 million or so.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay, and as it relates to Korea, you\u2019re saying the headline should be abating. Can you give us any income figures for Korea or revenues or some additional detail that you don\u2019t disclose in the press release?","John Gerspach","I\u2019m not going to go into specifics. We don\u2019t do specific country results. I will tell you this, our view is that -- again, revenues should be now growing sequentially in Korea. Excluding the repositioning charge, for the first time in several quarters, Korea actually turned a pre-tax profit. So again we're encouraged as to the future direction of our consumer franchise in Korea.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","As it relates to expenses, a few people have asked about this, but when I go back to the March 2013 presentation that gave efficiency targets, it said the high end of efficiency assumes flat revenues and revenues for the first half of this year versus last year, down 3%. So once again, why are you still comfortable with your efficiency targets for 2015 when revenues have been so much worse, and you highlighted slide 10 and slide 13, your efficiency targets for global consumer and ICG, just can you confirm that is for the entire year 2015? You still expect to get not only those two targets but for Citi Corp as a whole?","John Gerspach","Yes, I confirm that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And if I to give -- a very short answer, you've given a lot of things that you\u2019re doing, why can\u2019t you still reach those efficiency targets even though revenues have been so much worse?","Mike Corbat","Mike, its Mike. I think, as John is going to walk through things, we\u2019ve been taking a multi-pronged approach to the things. So the combination of headcount, support size, tech data information, we've been going across the board at different levers that we can pull to try and keep the expenses in line. And again I think as we think about the second half of the year, certainly on a sequential basis we are feeling better. I think if you look at the underlying drivers and fundamentals of the business, deposits, loans, what\u2019s going on in TTS, what\u2019s going on in the investment banking side of things, despite market challenges, parts of the firm are performing well and we think in the second year there are some continued revenue uplift there, and so again the combination of both levers around the efficiency ratio, the combination of revenue lift with expense discipline gets us to where we need to be. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And I guess the one wallet card is still legal and I know this settlement was lot more than I expected, or was more than almost any shareholder that I spoke with expected. And so if you can just give any additional color. I mean I just read one article saying that Department of Justice didn\u2019t want to hear about your small market share in some of the mortgage areas whereas that seems to be a relevant consideration. So why did you go ahead and settle for what is a huge amount in the minds of many shareholders as opposed to pushing this one? And what does this mean for your remaining legal issues? And what are your remaining legal issues and what do you think about it?","Mike Corbat","I think when you look at our settlement, Mike; there are two components to it. One is the RMBS which has been quantified and then if you\u2019ve got a go down the list of actually fine just on the list in terms of our size in participation. But I think the other side of that is what we did in terms of putting the CDO litigation behind us. And when you go back and you look at our participation and CDOs, you look at 2005, \u201906, \u201907, we were somewhere at or near the top of the lead tables year in and year out in CDOs, and so this was very important to get behind us and I think meaningful. And again as I think, we went through the negotiation, we felt to get this behind us that this was something that was in our shareholders\u2019 best interest to move on from.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And what remains, I assume, FX and LIBOR are the big ones, how should we think about that potential exposure or am I correct in assuming those are the two big remaining legal exposures.","Mike Corbat","We don\u2019t comment, Mike, in terms of forward-looking legal.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. And last question. If interest rates increase by a 100 basis points, what\u2019s the benefit to Citigroup today versus say a quarter ago?","Mike Corbat","A quarter ago, I think we\u2019ve told you it\u2019s somewhere between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for a parallel shift in the interest rate move, if interest rates move by a 100 basis points. That\u2019s about a 100 hires (ph) in out somewhere between $1.9 billion and $2 billion.","Operator","Your next question will come from the Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. I guess I was sort of wondering when you had spoken at a conference towards the end of May, you had mentioned that you though the entire market\u2019s revenue would be down kind of 20% to 25% and the FICC performance substantially better, and you kind of addressed a little bit around that but, I mean is it as simple as that June was better than the previous months, can you talk a little bit about that maybe put in the context of that current activity for the last couple of weeks and into the third quarter? ","Mike Corbat","Yeah, I\u2019d say that June was certainly a much better month overall from what we had -- the way we had viewed the market performance when we spoke at the conference at the end of May. And there is several events transpired at the end of May, beginning of June that had a common influence on the markets, specifically as it relates to spread products. So everything from the Crimea referendum, everything just sort of seem to calm down. And it was just a better overall environment, as I said, mostly for spread products in the month of June.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Now that\u2019s just kind of continue to show through in July so far.","Mike Corbat","Again, it\u2019s been just a couple of days in July, let\u2019s not get too carried away. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Okay. Another question kind of unrelated and that is given the strength of your capital and the high level of capital generation, are there ways that you can actually kind of use that capital position before you have an opportunity to return capital next year? I mean are there activities that you had reduced or stopped doing that you would consider doing again? I mean are there any ways to think about that for the back half of this year just given I mean even the sin buckets, so there are ways to kind of use those just given the strength of that capital position? ","Mike Corbat","I think Moshe, if you\u2019d go back; I think there is a couple of different ways we potentially think about using it. One is we\u2019re not going to do stupid things with it around putting risk on it doesn\u2019t make sense or doesn\u2019t fit to business model. But I think if you go back, you look at best pie and I think going forward then probably beat the opportunity to take a look at some more portfolios that might come available. And so again we\u2019d take a hard look at those and if they are accretive to the business, we\u2019d be prepared to act on those. ","Clearly we continue in our investor grow markets to grow and whether that\u2019s footprint, clients, balance sheet and so we are putting our capital to work in those areas and I\u2019d say those are probably the two primary things that we\u2019ve looked at in terms of capital use.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Just a follow up on that, Mike. The private label card is an area where there have been a couple of portfolios that are up for sell, any other areas that you would just specifically highlight where you\u2019ve seen kind of opportunities to put capital to work?","Mike Corbat","I think that the private label card, I think there is potentially some things coming forward in the cards business. John talked a little a bit about. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised in terms of the uptake on the American Airlines\u2019 portfolio opportunities to continue to grow organically. But I would say away from those things, Moshe, we are largely focused on what we can do organically around our business model. ","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Mike Corbat ","And again you\u2019ve seen both in consumer and both in ICG pretty good loan growth. "," ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Market.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","Following up on the comments about the good loan growth in ICG group, you guys had very strong corporate lending revenue growth in the quarter can you give us some color where the corporate loan growth is coming from?","Mike Corbat","Now again it\u2019s pretty widespread, trade products have continued to perform well. We actually saw a slight rise in loan spreads in trade loans this quarter. And we had good uptick from a corporate lending point of view in both Europe and North America. And some of that was related to activity in the capital markets area and M&A, but again it\u2019s been pretty good.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","The results for the second quarter, in the years past the large banks second quarter results often reflected the Shared National Credit exam, can you give some color to the results reflect -- your results this quarter reflect any changes that the regulators may have had due to the SNC exam and maybe where does that stand right now the SNC exam?","Mike Corbat","Yes, I am not aware that we had to make any significant changes as a result of the Shared National Credit exam.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","Another question sticking with the ICG group, can you guys estimate how much of the fall off in the trading revenues are cyclical versus secular? I know it\u2019s a difficult question, but the volatility is certainly down in this business; hopefully it will come back to drive revenues higher, but can you give us an estimate what you\u2019re thinking might be and then as part of that, are you at a size if it is a secular decline, are you comfortable with the size of your expense base if a part of it is a secular decline?","Mike Corbat","Yes, as you\u2019ve said, Gerard, it\u2019s really hard to come up with an actual number as to what is cyclical versus secular. We continue to evaluate how we view the various offering that we have in those markets businesses and we constantly adjust our capacity to where we think the new secular trend is, so again it\u2019s somewhat product by product as opposed to just say, its markets in general and again its things move based upon market conditions.","You take a look at our FICC revenues for this quarter. FICC revenues were down 12% now that was primarily driven by rates in currencies. And rates in currencies are going to respond to what\u2019s going on in the market. But even in the rates in currencies, rates in currencies were down something close to 30% for the quarter. But you\u2019re looking -- you\u2019re comparing rates in currencies this second quarter compared to the second quarter of \u201913 and second quarter of \u201913 was relatively strong quarter for rates in currencies. And in fact our results in the second quarter benefited from some outside gains that we took as we correctly lowered our inventories in our local markets business in anticipation of increased negative sentiment in the EM associated with the tapering.","So the absence of those prior year gains associated with the de-risking contributed probably a full 6 percentage point to the year-over-year decline in risk in currencies revenues, and so risk in currencies down 23% year-over-year that\u2019s kind of in line with what would I think expect from a seasonal point of view and in the currency environment. So hard to find that there is something dramatically secular going on there. When you look at spread products on the other hand, spread products were up just about 30% year-over-year and basically the entire year-on-year increase occurred in the month of June following the improvement in markets sentiment that I referenced earlier. So you\u2019re still seeing a lot of cyclical that\u2019s running through the year the various businesses at this point.","Mike Corbat","And I think the second part of your question, if you go to Slide 13, ICG is not standing and watching that if you go back and look at Slide 13, you see the nine consecutive quarters, you see from a core operating expense that the business is taking out about $1.1 billion of operating expense. So again continuing to stay focused on the model when the cyclical versus secular and trying to make sure we\u2019re adjusting to those two pieces.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","Shifting gears moving onto Citi holdings, you\u2019ve gave us some good color about the pending sales that you have in the pipeline and I think you\u2019ve said almost $1 billion of that number come from mortgage loans, what are you seeing in pricing for the distressed assets in the mortgage area, I am assuming it\u2019s improved but by how much?","Mike Corbat ","It\u2019s improved. I can\u2019t give you an actual figure quarter-on-quarter. I just don\u2019t have it in my head, but it has improved. But again it\u2019s improved, but you have to take a look at those loans broken out by a bunch of different categories and also by the location of the loan, by specific MSA code. So it isn\u2019t as though the entire market is re-priced up by 500 basis points or something like that. It really is product dependent and market dependent. And as you know, we have been very active sellers of these mortgages in the past. So it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t already gone through this book and done a lot of sales activity.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","This is in due putting this mortgage problem behind you with the settlement today, is there ever a reason to do a very large bulk sale in Citi Holdings? And to put it behind you, is that ever feasible?","Mike Corbat","I think it\u2019s all dependent upon price. If the price was right, we\u2019d be happy to do it. I think based on current market prices and you can see the improvements on the NCLs and you can kind of do your own market check and look at what the market would pay for these assets versus the funding collect out value and today I\u2019d say it\u2019s not there, but if they were to present itself, we\u2019d be happy to react to it.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","Would you say it\u2019s extremely wide from what you, in terms of market prices versus what you\u2019re comfortable with or are we within, is it something that within the realm of possibility?","Mike Corbat","No I think, again I think as John said, you can\u2019t just take the entire portfolio and lump it because it goes through first through seconds through the deal with CFNA mortgages and all are very different and all have very different pricing characteristics to it. So it\u2019s probably most likely amongst the prime first, you\u2019d get close first and as you move down that spectrum that bid to offer spread so to speak would probably widen out.","But again, as we look there what we want to sell, it\u2019s not just the headline asset reduction, but more importantly it\u2019s the removal of risk, it\u2019s the removal of cost of servicing and in particular special servicing against these and obviously capital release. So we look at it against what we see the risk-adjusted earnings power of the asset is and if it\u2019s close, we\u2019re happy to move on I would say for a lot of the portfolio today we don\u2019t see that, but not to say it won\u2019t happen some point in the future.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market","Great. And then just last question, I may have missed this, I apologize. You guys have moved very swiftly in reducing your branch count here in, globally, but in North America as well. Is there much left to do in North America in terms of reducing the number of branches in the consumer business?","Mike Corbat","I think you will see continued centralization of our branches around the key metropolitan areas. And again in accordance with our stated strategy where we want to really focus on the large cities. So I still think that there is some level of branch rationalization yet to go.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co.","Yes, good morning. Earlier in the quarter there were a number of press reports about attempts to sell one main financial and I\u2019m just thinking, does it make sense for Citi to sell a profit-making company for cash, but it can\u2019t return to shareholders? Or is there a way to spin it out to shareholders or what if that got caught up in the whole CCAR process or would it count as a disposition if you did it that way?","Mike Corbat","Well I think, again kind of going back we in my words crossed the bridge back in 2009 when we placed one main into holdings or at that point Citi Financial into holdings. And while it\u2019s a terrific business, the subprime unsecured lending business is not a business that's core to who we are or our client base for our future.","So again what we\u2019ve said is, we want to in essence maximize the exit value for our shareholders and we\u2019ve been running that in accordance with that. And I think as we\u2019ve shown in holdings dispositions we\u2019re wide open to different structures, spin sale, different approaches are on the table. And I think as we get closer to kind of looking at that exit, we\u2019ll certainly way all of those.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Maybe if we could just step back for a few minutes and talk about the list of strategic priorities, Mike you\u2019ve articulated since you moved into CEO role there was of course the operating expense reduction, the DTA utilization, the resumption of revenue growth across different regions. The reallocation of resources among different global geographies that maybe were under scale and maybe an unspoken one was some of the resizing that occurred in-site, ICG. So I wonder now, where would you say you are like which ending are you in with respect to those various priorities?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think if you go back and you touched on some, so I think you\u2019ve seen from the efficiency ratio perspective in your operating expenses I think you\u2019ve seen pretty consistent progress against moving towards the target that we set out for the company. I think that when you look at things such as DTA, at the point we really stated the priority of DTA utilization, DTA was still going the wrong way, we\u2019re still increasing. And I think since that point in time we\u2019ve showed the consistent ability to use it. I think the PC didn\u2019t mention in there was we said John and I had put out it by the end of 2015, we wanted to get holdings to breakeven. And I think this quarter got us there a little bit early and it\u2019s our job to work to try and obviously sustain that. And I think candidly the most challenging part of it has really been the revenue side of things, it\u2019s been the environment. I think a combination of the economic, the regulatory and the political nature of things around the world has probably made things more challenging than we certainly would have liked. We\u2019ve tried to continue to adjust the business model to that.","So I think that we\u2019ve made progress on everything that we\u2019ve set out to do, we\u2019ve got more work to do, we\u2019re not going to rest until we get there. But I feel quite good and quite proud of what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish in the last 1.5 years or so.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And you touched on the benefits to reductions from the sale of Greece and Spain. Were there any geographies that sort of moved into the review bucket in the past quarter or two quarters that maybe the market is nowhere?","Mike Corbat","No I think, again we showed the optimized list as part of the 2013 exercise, John spoke earlier to the progress against that bucket that in fact we\u2019ve made about 330 basis points of efficiency gains in 2013 and we\u2019ve continued to get those gains in 2014. And what we\u2019ve said I think remains consistent today that we need to have a pathway or a line of vision or a line of sight to those businesses or geographies making sense over the intermediate or longer time frame. And so if we discover businesses or believe their businesses that can\u2019t get there, they\u2019ll absolutely come under strategic review.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just last question from me on slide 24, the last 12 months return analysis. The 10% that\u2019s listed there and then there is a call-out box, so including the DTA it would be 13%. You changed a little bit from the prior quarter. So I am just curious, would that number have increased the number excluding the DTA? Would that increase sequentially this period?","Mike Corbat","No actually on a trailing 12 months basis, because we\u2019ve generated more capital our denominator has increased and therefore has lowered the return.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","So that actually got to the cracks of my question, that the compounding of capital is occurring at a rate faster than what\u2019s occurring in the new areas, effectively correct?","Mike Corbat","That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on. As I said in the opening in the first half of the year we generated about $10 billion of capital.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Erica Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erica Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","My questions have all been asked and answered.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","","I just had a few quick questions here. You said that the revenues in Citi Holdings benefited from the asset sales done there. Can you give us what the dollar impact was from the benefit and it was all to NII?","Mike Corbat","If the dollar amount of the asset sales is somewhat similar to the dollar amount that we have disclosed last quarter as far as the benefit of asset sales, which was somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million or so. So it\u2019s roughly flattish to the first quarter.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","","And then off Citi Holdings and the period of loans went down 8 billion, other assets went down about 300 million but the total assets went down 3 billion. What\u2019s the driver of the delta there? Is it organic growth?","Mike Corbat","You\u2019re focused on Holdings, right? I just want to make sure. Yes as we sign to sell the businesses in Spain and Greece, they come out of the loan book and they go into assets held for sale. So they move down into other asset category. That\u2019s the way that once you\u2019ve got an asset held for sale, you one line the assets and one line the liabilities of those businesses, and so therefore they come out of loans or whatever other balance sheet line they are in and they all go down to other assets and other liabilities. That\u2019s all.","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","","And then within the efficiency ratio that you looked out in the global consumer banking, excluding Korea and mortgage banking would be meaningfully lower. But even if you back out the expenses related to Korea this quarter, still mortgage banking is being a drag on the efficiency ratio. Do you still think that market share gains is enough to improve the efficiency ratio there or do you actually do more repositioning in North America mortgage?","Mike Corbat","Well we\u2019ve actually have been taking -- the expenses have been coming out of North America mortgages. Now they come out of mortgages on somewhat of a lag basis because you tend to recognize your revenues, especially when you\u2019re doing originate to sell you tend to recognize the revenues when you lock in the rate, when you do a rate lock. And then you still have another quarter where you\u2019ve got to do all the processing in order to really make the sale. But, in general, the expenses have been coming down in North America. We think we have got the, with the expense reductions that we should expect to see in the third quarter, I think that the business is properly sized both from certainly from an expense point of view compared to the level of originations that we would expect to get out of that business.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies ","","John, first on follow-up on Holdings, so the adjusted operating margins gotten up to 700 with the help from that 200 million of gains, is it fair to say that we are now kind of in this new higher range for that operating margin for Citi Holdings or is it still just dependent on whether or not you can get those gains every quarter as you continue to make incremental sales?","John Gerspach ","","I would say it\u2019s still dependent upon our ability to get those gains, so I would tend to look more of the 100 as the level that we would expect in that business, somewhere between 400 and 500. And if we get a reasonable amount of asset sales then you would get up to the 700 level.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay and then secondly on credit quality. This quarter is interesting that the reserve released in consumer and specifically North America card was bigger than it\u2019s been for a while and then conversely the mortgage released in Holdings was actually smaller. So, can you help us dimension, how should we just think about aggregate release going forward and what you anticipate would be the bigger drivers from here?","John Gerspach","","Clearly the reserve release that we had in cards, as I tried to indicate in some of the remarks that I made, that was really in response to the fact that the credit performance in cards just got a lot better than what we have been anticipating at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we were talking about overall North America NCL rates sort of leveling off at 3% for the year and we just continue to see much more favorable delinquency experience as well as NCL experience in both branded cards and retail services. And we expect that level of NCL and delinquency to continue, so that\u2019s what really drove the reserve release in the second quarter. I don\u2019t expect that the reserve releases in those two cards businesses to stay at the level that we have had in either the first or the second quarter as we move into the second half of the year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And then on the mortgage side is it just more dependent on sales from here then it is on credit performance?","John Gerspach","","No, if you take a look at just at mortgages, I believe that if you look at the reserve release as a percentage of the NCL that we have took in mortgages, it\u2019s roughly equivalent to where we have been. I think that the reserve release was equal to about 86% of the net credit losses that we had in the Holdings\u2019 mortgage book and we have been running somewhere between 85% and 90% in any of the last several quarters. So, that reserve release is likely going to again somewhere in that 85% to 90% range of the NCLs that we ultimately charge off in mortgages.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay and then quick question on the asset yield. So, you mentioned that the NIM should be pretty stable from here, deposit cost look sort of flattened. So, can you talk to us about incremental loan yields and incremental securities purchases and then ability to continue to just grow overall balance sheet in terms of NII dollars?","John Gerspach","","Our expectation is that loans will continue to grow. I mean we still have loan growth in, again focused on the Citicorp business. Citicorp loans grew 8% year-over-year and we anticipate again still getting good healthy loan growth in our Citicorp businesses. Those loan growth, even if spreads comedown a little bit on loans that still gives you a nice healthy contribution to your near and your NIM. I think you are right as far as deposit cost, I think that\u2019s probably going to be somewhat flattish from here on out may be a slight uptick but not much. But we still have the ability to lower our overall cost of funds as we continue to issue, rollover the long-term debt at more favorable spreads then what we were issuing several years ago.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay and then last question on that last point, John. As far as the long-term debt and then also more importantly the continued preferred issuance and I think you guys are still around 70 basis points of B3 RWAs. Can you give us an understanding of just how much of that long-term debt is for roll and then also your general issuance plans on how much of that preferred bucket you want to continue to get on?","John Gerspach","","As far as long-term debt, I think we are pretty much at the level certainly of the long-term debt held at the holding company we are pretty much at the level that we think we need to be on a full year basis. And so there will continue to be issuance. We will give you an update on those issuance plans when we do our fixed income conference towards the end of this week but I think it\u2019s pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave out at the end of the first quarter. And we will continue to be an issuer of preferred stock; we recognize that we\u2019ve got some preferred stock issuance to do over the next three to five years, so we will be issuing preferred stock but in a somewhat paced approach.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Security.","","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security","Good morning, thanks for taking my questions, just a follow up on John, your pretty positive commentary about underwriting strength and M&A strength and I guess I\u2019m trying to get a little more color on was that just in the US or are you gaining, you feel you\u2019re gaining share across the different geographies, Asia, Europe and the US in both those businesses.","","John Gerspach","I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly widespread, obviously it\u2019s going to be a little bit heavier in some geographies than other and I don\u2019t want to get into you know a geography-by-geography commentary. But again it\u2019s a wide spread you know improvement in the second quarter certainly in the wallet share and again as we look to, as the wallet share that we\u2019re capturing in the announced M&A again that\u2019s fairly broad based.","","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security","Okay and then just returning to slide 24, I appreciate the breakout of the average allocated TCE which I presume is going to be updated annually, I guess I\u2019m curious as to the 42 billion of TCE allocated to corp and other, is that going to stay at a roughly similar amount to the total Citigroup capital or could that be moved down into some of the operating units over time.","","John Gerspach","Well when we set up the amount equal to corp other there we laid out the rationale for how we got there, it\u2019s a little bit of the operations that we have in corp other, importantly it\u2019s where we hold the capital associated with the DTA, it\u2019s where we hold some of the operator\u2019s capital that we can\u2019t quite allocate to other businesses and importantly as we continue to generate capital, you know, far in excess of our ability to distribute capital, that amount will grow over time, so we\u2019ll do an annual you know re-appropriation based upon what the level of capital that we think is appropriate for each business, but as long as we continue to be net generators of TCE you\u2019re going to see more of that in the corp other number.","","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security","And then just finally from me, you mentioned that the impact of a 100 basis point higher rate is slightly more at the end of June then it was at the end of March, I noticed that your securities, your investment portfolio is up about 8% year-over-year or 4% quarter-over-quarter. Can you update on what the estimated reduction in your tangible common equity would be from a 100 basis point higher rate environment. ","","Mike Corbat","You know again, we\u2019ll put this all out next, probably when we do the fixed income conference, but my recollection is that it goes to about $3.4 billion.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS.","","Derek De Vries - UBS ","Thanks, I have a couple of questions on Latin America, I guess starting with last week the Mexican Anti Trust Authority published recommendations on reform, I was hoping you could give us some of those key recommendations and maybe talk a little bit about the impact they could have on dynamics.","","Mike Corbat","I have to tell you we don\u2019t view what was published last week as having any significant near term impact on dynamics, I say that the industry\u2019s still sorting through what was published and it\u2019s still in the early stages of analysis.","","Derek De Vries - UBS ","Maybe a little more concrete, the provisions in Latin America ticked up, and I take on board your comments about portfolio growth and seasoning, but if there\u2019s nothing sort of one off in nature there, is this a level we should sort of expect going forward from Latin America or is there some one-off things in there.","","Mike Corbat","It\u2019s not necessarily one-off, but again most of the performance and the credit performance in Latin America consumer really is being driven by Mexico cards, and the consumer in Mexico is still absorbing a little bit of the fiscal reform actions that they have gone through and clearly as the Mexico economy continues to struggle to really regain the momentum that everyone thought that it would have, consumer spending has not been robust, so we would anticipate, it\u2019s what he said that the NCO rate will remain relatively high through the end of this year, that\u2019s why we said that Latin America NCO rate will probably stay at around the first half levels but you know, we do believe that once that gets behind us there should be improvement in those NCO rates, as we go into next year, so still feel very good about the overall the underlying credit quality in our Mexico cards portfolio.","","Derek De Vries - UBS ","And then I guess one last question just touching on it, I think you\u2019ve had talked about a lot today. The last quarter you said that when you made your 2015 targets you build in about 200 basis points in your efficiency ratio for litigation, so obviously going off a lot from this year, I am just wondering with three months further along, do you still feel comfortable, you\u2019ll get enough of litigation stuff behind you this year at the 200 basis points for litigations. So a good gap as to where you\u2019ll come out next year?","John Gerspach","Just to be clear, I believe that what I said was that the 200 basis points would cover to both, repositioning as well as legal and related costs. So we\u2019ll have to see as we get closer to the yearend we\u2019ll take a look, but again, we still believe based upon what we look at today that we should be able to achieve the efficiency targets that we set out for 2015.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","Just back on the balance sheet dynamics in a potentially changing rate environment at some point ended deposit velocity question that Guy was getting to earlier. Can you just help us understand if you do have certain level that you baked into your modeling, how do you think about the outcome in terms of may be that -- I mean over half deposits or in fact from ICG group and third is our -- in North America, so it\u2019s still a relatively good contribution total deposits. How you do think about maybe isolating that component that could be at risk in terms of reversal, once raised eventually move higher?","John Gerspach","Yes. Actually we don\u2019t view that component as being at risk because, certainly, I won\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t $1 of deposit but it is at risk but the overall deposit level, we don\u2019t view as being at risk, especially on a TTS businesses, the trend, the treasury and trade, the solutions of deposits, because they really represent for the most part operating account balances. And so those are the funds that businesses need to have in order just to conduct their ongoing operations. So again, we feel relatively good about it, now if the FED tapering or if the FED comes in and does something to try to drain liquidity out of the system that could impact future deposit growth, but it\u2019s not likely to impact the absolute level of deposit that we currently have in those businesses.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","And do you have any updated LCR reach it at this point or is that something we should refer not a fixed income call question maybe?","John Gerspach","That calculation is still ongoing and we\u2019ll give that to you when we do the fixed income call. It still is a very strong ratio. I just don\u2019t have it in front of me right now.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","The last quarter was about 120-ish, if I recall correctly?","John Gerspach","Yes. It\u2019s going to be just around that maybe even slightly higher, when we publish at this week.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","Got it. And then just lastly, I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions of interest ratios and goals, but can you just help us understand maybe just to come it down like, if in fact the revenue environment remains to have it and tougher for longer, if the revenue environment is stagnant here, there certainly sounds like there\u2019s room on TCB to move nearly on ICG as well. And efficiency ratio really been met, if the revenue environment today seems as it is for another six quarter or so, is that possible is there enough room on what you have already or would it drive -- you generally think maybe point another something like to draw, that we consider other things?","John Gerspach","Let\u2019s think about the revenue environment that you refer to, all right. We have ongoing revenue growth and has had ongoing revenue growth in Latin America even as Mexico has slowed down. So the revenue environment for Latin America still seems to be in growth mode and we feel very good about the way our franchises position there. When you take a look at Asia, we now have got the Korea repositioning behind us. And we have had underlying growth in each of our franchises in Asia over the last several quarter, but that has been offset in many ways by the reduction in revenues in Korea so we actually are quite constructive as far as the revenue environment today in Asia, Asia consumer has producing growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the second half of the year. So we feel really good about the performance of our Asia consumer franchise going forward. In North America, we\u2019ve got the mortgage repositioning out of the way, so our mortgage revenues stabilized in the first quarter they actually grew in the second quarter, we\u2019ve got that business now positioned properly we think for the way the market should move forward. And again we\u2019re not looking to constantly gain, we don\u2019t look to be number one or number two in that business we just want to be able to serve our customers through our retail branches within appropriate mix of correspondence business. So again we\u2019re very constructive on what we\u2019ve been able to do with the mortgage business. Branded cards I mentioned we\u2019ve got purchase sales growth, we\u2019ve got good underlying momentum in the full rate loans in that business and importantly in the products where we have actually been investing. When you take a look at branded cards, branded cards I think the year-over-year sales growth purchase sales growth was about 5% but if you look at the portfolios where we\u2019ve actually been investing the sales growth there year-over-year is upwards of 8%. So again we feel really good about the momentum and the revenue prospects for branded card. So in our consumer franchises from a revenue momentum point of view we feel good about the revenue momentum.","And then when you move over to the ICG, we look at the banking franchise and again with the past investments that we\u2019ve made in investment banking we\u2019re doing very well as far as being able to maintain or actually grow wallet share. We\u2019ve had several quarters in a row now of 1 billion or a $1 billion plus revenue quarters. So again we feel good about the revenue momentum in that business. We feel very good about the revenue momentum that we\u2019ve got in transaction services in TTS. 10 quarter, eight quarters in a row, we struggled with spread compression overwhelming the volume growth because of the contribution of volume growth. Now that we see the impact of the spread compression beginning to abate the impact of the volume growth now actually is able to overcome the spread compression. And so we feel really good about the revenue prospects for that business going forward.","So then that leaves you with markets. And I think we spend an awful lot of time focused on what\u2019s going on in markets but markets while it\u2019s an important part of our business it is not the largest contributor to our overall revenue picture or our overall profitability. And so I think that there are some legitimate questions going forward as far as markets but the rest of the business I\u2019d say we feel pretty good about the revenue prospects.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","That\u2019s helpful, thanks for that summary. And then in terms of in markets and maybe it\u2019s summarized in the ICG when you referenced your I think comp ratio this last quarter was 29% in line with last year. Should we expected that should remain or could it tick higher just because as one referenced earlier as well still trying to figure out how much is cyclical versus secular?","Mike Corbat","The 29% that I referenced is actually the comp ratio over a trailing 12 month basis. So that\u2019s 29% both for full year 2013 and 29% for the last 12 months as measured as of the end of this quarter.","","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore","And should we expect that for the full year or is that?","Mike Corbat","I am not going to forecast where comp ratio is going to be but you can see that we\u2019ve been holding in fairly constant.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","So one of your competitors provided some helpful disclosure on the advanced approach framework under CCAR specifically which reflected an additional 100 basis point decline in the Firm\u2019s Tier 1 common under stress due to the stressed RWA inflation under the Basel III advanced framework. And since the advanced framework appears to be your binding capital constraint at the moment, I was wondering whether you\u2019ve conducted a similar assessment internally and if so if you could provide some guidance as to how the advanced approach framework could further impact future risk based capital ratios under CCAR?","Mike Corbat","I got to tell you, I have not spent any time looking at what our peer institution put out there, so I apologize.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Have you done the work yourselves though?","Mike Corbat","I am not sure what they did, so I don\u2019t know what they did so I can\u2019t comment as to whether or not we did something similar.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears and as a follow up to Betsy\u2019s question on operational risk capital your comments indicated that 56 billion true-up proposed by the Fed or imposed by the Fed late last year, contemplate some buffer for litigation matters not yet resolved. And I was just wondering what the process is for the Fed providing guidance on op risk capital level so is the feedback given quarterly or is it nearly evaluated as part of the advanced model submissions which from what I recall is actually an annual process?","Mike Corbat","Yes, it\u2019s something that is under discussion periodically. But obviously goes through a much fuller exam on an annual basis.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Okay. And then just one more from me on capital allocations, as part of your enhanced segment disclosure on slide 24 the amount of capital allocated exclusive of DTA to support the operations in Corp and Holdings and focusing I guess or excluding the corporate other segment was a combined 126 billion or so which implies on current RWA levels about a 10% Tier 1 common target. And I was wondering if we should think about that 10% Tier 1 common ratio as an appropriate through the cycle target for Citigroup at this juncture or is it simply still too early to make such a determination?","Mike Corbat","Again when you take a look at the underlying franchises in Citi right now. We clearly think that the Citicorp businesses are capable of producing mid-teens ROTCE, and again that\u2019s going to be -- so the overall firm\u2019s contribution to ROTCE is going to be dependent upon our ability to return capital at some point in time.","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Actually there is one more quick question regarding the DTA disclosure. Can you update us on the level of U.S. foreign tax credits that are subject to expiry by 2018? I know it was about 9.9 billion at the end of the year, but obviously you\u2019ve made some progress over the last two quarters.","John Gerspach ","Yes, we update those disclosures on an annual basis. There is just too much movement during individual quarters that actually come up with something that is relevant. So we will update you at the end of this year as to the progress that we have been making.","Operator","You have no further questions at this time.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website,  citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan.  Good morning everyone.  This morning we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the first quarter of 2013.  Excluding CVA and DVA, net income was $4 billion, or $1.29 per share.","During the quarter, we benefited from seasonally strong results in our markets businesses, sustained momentum in investment banking, and continued year over year growth in loans and deposits in Citicorp, in a more favorable credit environment.","As I\u2019ve said, achieving consistent high quality earnings is one of my top priorities, and these first quarter results are encouraging.  However, although this was a good start for 2013, the environment remains challenging, and we\u2019re sure to be tested as we go through the year ahead.","In addition to our performance across business lines, there were several other areas that I\u2019d want to point out.  First, our capital strength again improved during the quarter with the tier one common ratio increasing to an estimated 9.3% on a Basel III basis, and we now expect the ratio to reach at least 10% by the end of this year.","After a very thorough process, we were pleased that our regulators did not object to the capital plan we submitted, and although the requested returns were modest, the permission to do so, which was based on both quantitative and qualitative analysis, is meaningful.  As I said on my first earnings call, it\u2019s critical that Citi be viewed as an indisputably strong and stable institution and we made progress toward that goal during the first quarter.","Next, as I\u2019ve highlighted, we have two areas of intense focus for our company: to reduce the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings, and to utilize our deferred tax assets.  We made progress on both fronts.  We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings by $7 billion.  Holdings assets now total just under $150 billion, or 8% of our balance sheet.","And more importantly, the loss in holdings was reduced to less than $800 million, driven by improvement in credit costs, including a $375 million reserve release related to North American mortgages.  And we began utilizing reserves as the mortgage portfolio continues to shrink, credit performance continues to improve, and we become more comfortable that the housing recovery is sustainable.  As a result, we will continue to analyze this portfolio and adjust our reserve levels accordingly.","We also did consume a small amount of our DTA during the first quarter.  $700 million of DTA was utilized, and we\u2019re focused on generating sustainable U.S. taxable earnings which are the primary driver of DTA consumption.","Lastly, I said on my first earnings presentation that I would soon announce the metrics by which you can measure our progress.  Last month I presented three targets we aim to reach by the end of 2015.  First is achieving an efficiency ratio in Citicorp in the mid-50% range.  Second, we want to generate a return on Citigroup\u2019s tangible common equity of over 10%, and third is reaching a return on Citigroup\u2019s assets of between 90 and 110 basis points in a risk-balanced manner.","These goals will not be easily reached on a full year basis, but they\u2019re the right ones for our company, given the environment.  And as I\u2019ve said, you are what you measure, and we will hold ourselves accountable.","We\u2019re executing the repositioning plan we announced in December, but as I\u2019ve said, driving efficiency needs to be business as usual, and we\u2019re working hard to ingrain that into the organization.","To that end, as you may have heard last week, we\u2019ll remove a layer of management in our institutional clients group so that our six principal lines of business will report directly to Jamie Forese.  This simplification preserves the businesses which are core to our unparalleled global network and will lead to better integration in service of our institutional clients.","Looking ahead, I believe the environment is going to remain challenging.  Europe\u2019s issues, as the situation in Cypress shows, still have the potential to rattle the markets and impact investor confidence.  At best, the Euro Zone is in a period of austerity instead of growth, and the ongoing low rate environment, new regulation, and cost of putting certain legacy issues behind us will continue to put pressure on our earnings.","But I am confident we\u2019re on the right course, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters.  Now John will go over the slides, and then we\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions.  John?","John Gerspach ","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone.  To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter.  First, CVA and DVA were negative $319 million pretax, and $198 million after tax, in the first quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.06.  For comparison purposes, in the first quarter of 2012 CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion pretax, or $800 million after tax, for a negative impact of $0.27 per share.","In addition, in the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax gain of roughly $475 million related to the sale of minority investments, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.10 per share in that quarter.  Adjusting for CVA\/DVA, we earned $4 billion in the first quarter of 2013, or $1.29 per share, as compared to $1.11 per share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2012.","Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding CVA\/DVA, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to provide comparability to prior periods.","In addition, as shown on slide four, there are a few other significant items which are included in our results.  First, operating expenses in the first quarter included legal and related costs of over $700 million, compared to nearly $1.3 billion last quarter and $545 million in the prior year.","Legal and related costs in Citicorp were down significantly in the first quarter, to $66 million.  However, Citi Holdings\u2019 legal expenses increased to over $600 million, primarily reflecting higher legacy legal expenses in the special asset pool.  Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated, and volatile, as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us.","Second, repositioning costs were $148 million in the first quarter, compared to $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $66 million in the first quarter of last year.  Given the higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarter, today I\u2019ll be discussing our results excluding the charges in that quarter to provide comparability.","And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the first quarter was $652 million, including a release of roughly $375 million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings.  In total, the net reserve release was $86 million in the prior quarter, and nearly $1.2 billion in the first quarter of last year.","On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter.  Revenues of $20.8 billion grew 3% from last year, while operating expenses of $12.4 billion increased 1%, driven by the higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.","Excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, core operating expenses were $11.5 billion in the first quarter, down slightly from the prior year.  Looking forward, core operating expenses should decline as we begin to see the benefits of the repositioning actions announced last December.","Credit costs of $2.5 billion declined 16% versus last year.  Net credit losses of $3 billion were down 25%.  However, the loan loss reserve release also declined by nearly half, to $652 million.","We earned $4 billion of net income in the first quarter, or $1.29 per share, up from $1.11 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.","Our effective tax rate was also higher in the first quarter, at 29% versus 27% last year.  We expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 30% in 2013, as a result of both higher expected earnings in North America as well as a higher tax rate on international operations.","The increased rate on earnings outside North America is due to a change in our assertion that earnings in certain entities would be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.  As we have built up capital in these entities that is adequate to support future investments, we now believe that current and future earnings in these entities could be repatriated at some point.","Citigroup end of period loans were flat year over year at $646 billion in the first quarter, as growth in Citicorp was offset by the [line] down of Citi Holdings.  And deposits grew 3% to $934 billion.","On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings.  Citicorp generated first quarter revenues of $19.9 billion, and net income of $4.8 billion.  Year over year, revenues grew 2% and expenses declined by 2%, driven by lower legal and related expenses in Citicorp.","Credit costs increased modestly year over year, as a decline in net credit losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases.  And we continue to grow loans year over year in each core business.  Total Citicorp loans grew 5%, with consumer loans up 1% and corporate loans up 9%.","Citi Holdings had revenues of $910 million, and a net loss of $788 million, a significant improvement from prior periods, driven by lower credit costs.  Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $149 billion of assets, down $60 billion, or 29%, year over year.  At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 8% of total Citigroup assets.","Turning now to Citicorp, on slide seven we show Citicorp\u2019s pretax earnings by business, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, on a trailing 12-month basis.  Through the first quarter, pretax earnings grew to $21 billion, an increase of nearly 30% over the prior year 12 months, driven by consumer banking and securities and banking.","Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking.  Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the first quarter were down 1% year over year.  In retail banking, revenues were down 3%, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by spread compression in this low rate environment.","Cards revenues, on the other hand, were flat versus last year, as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an improvement in net interest spreads, as we benefited from both an improvement in yields as well as lower funding costs.","Sequentially, total revenues declined 4%, on lower mortgage gain on sale margins as well as seasonally lower cards revenues.  Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were up 4% year over year, reflecting higher volume-related costs and repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings.","On a sequential basis, expenses declined on lower legal and related costs.  Credit costs of roughly $900 million dollars increased 12% year over year.  Net credit losses declined by 23% to $1.3 billion, driven by an improvement in cards.  However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower at $370 million this quarter.  Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, increased by nearly 20% to $1.4 billion.","Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise.  Average deposits continue to grow, up 10% year over year, including 17% growth in checking account balances.  In branded cards, accounts also grew, up 3% from last year.  And, for both card portfolios, we saw continued expansion in net interest spreads.","On slide nine, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars.  On this basis, both revenues and expenses grew 3% year over year.  In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses were up 7% from last year, as spread compressions slowed revenue growth while volumes remained strong.  In Asia, revenues were down slightly versus last year, and expenses were flat.  And in EMEA, revenues grew 2%, with a 2% decline in expenses.","While international consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression in certain markets, as well as the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the first quarter.  Total average loans grew 4% from last year.  Card purchase sales were up 7%, and investment sales grew 24% year over year.","Based on this continued volume growth, as well as the expected efficiency savings, we currently believe both Latin America and Asia will return to positive operating leverage on a full year basis in 2013.  Credit costs of $829 million in the first quarter were up 6% from last year, on higher net credit losses due mostly to loan growth and portfolio seasoning.","Slide ten shows our international consumer credit trends in more detail.  Credit quality in our international consumer portfolio remained strong in the first quarter, with stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis across each region.  In Asia, the NCL rate returned to below 1%, with 90-plus day delinquencies at around 50 basis points.  And, in Latin America, the NCL rate was fairly stable at 4.6%.  We continue to believe that the NCL rate in Latin America should normalize around 4.5% by the second half of 2013.","Slide 11 shows our securities and banking business.  Revenues of $7.3 billion grew 8% from last year, and 50% from the prior quarter.  Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were up 22% from the prior year, with higher revenues in all major products.  Revenues increased 6% sequentially, and overall investment banking wallet share continued to improve in the quarter.","Equity market revenues of $826 million were down 10% from last year, due in part to the impact of lower volatility on derivatives revenues, and increased 78% from the fourth quarter, on higher cash equity volumes and improved derivatives performance.","Fixed income market revenues of $4.6 billion declined 3% from last year as rates and currencies revenues were down from a very strong prior year period, partially offset by growth in securitized products.  Sequentially, fixed income revenues were up 69% on improved results across all products.","Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $333 million in the first quarter, down 7% from last year, primarily related to loan sale activity and down 12% sequentially on lower average loans and a slight decline in spreads.","Total operating expenses of $3.6 billion were down 4% from last year, and up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher incentive compensation.  Net income of $2.5 billion grew 17% year over year, and more than doubled versus the prior quarter.","Moving to transaction services, on slide 12, revenues of $2.6 billion were down 4% from last year on a reported basis and down 2% in constant dollars.  Treasury and trade solutions was down 3% in constant dollars, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression globally. And, securities and fund services revenues grew 2% in constant dollars, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.","While spread compression dampened revenues this quarter, the volume drivers for transaction services continued to show momentum.  Average trade loans grew 20% year over year, average deposits were up 10%, assets under custody grew by 8%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 5%.  Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 3% from last year on a reported basis, and up 4% in constant dollars, mainly on higher volumes, and down 5% sequentially due in part to lower legal and related costs.","While spread compression is likely to continue to impact revenues in the near term, we believe we can achieve revenue growth and a return to positive operating leverage on a full year basis in 2013.","Slide 13 shows the results for corporate other.  Revenues were flat versus the prior year, while expenses of $568 million declined 28% on lower legal and related expenses.  Assets of $280 billion included approximately $83 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $143 billion of liquid available for sale securities.","Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets.  We ended the quarter with assets of $149 billion in Citi Holdings, or roughly 8% of total Citigroup assets.  The $7 billion reduction in the first quarter reflected $2 billion of asset sales, $4 billion of net paydowns, and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit.","As you can see on the slide, other assets in local consumer lending increased during the quarter, by nearly $3 billion.  These are primarily loans held for sale, where we were in the process of a transaction but had not yet closed as of quarter end.","On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter.  Total revenues of $910 million were up 15% year over year as higher revenues in the special asset pool were partially offset by a decline in local consumer lending, driven by declining loan balances.","Citi Holdings expenses increased 23% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs in the special asset pool.  Excluding these higher legal costs, core operating expenses declined 18% year over year to roughly $860 million.  This decline reflects declining assets as well as the expiration of certain transition services agreements related to prior sales activity.","Credit costs declined 44% year over year to roughly $750 million.  Net credit losses declined significantly to $930 million, and the net loan loss reserve release was over $350 million, including a release of roughly $375 million related to North America mortgages.","Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 16, rep and warranty reserve bills and legal and related costs continued to weigh on Citi Holdings.  On an operating basis, however, excluding these items and repositioning, we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the first quarter.","Credit trends were particularly favorable, with North America mortgage NCLs declining to $630 million, roughly 60% of which were offset by reserve releases.  We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 36 months of coverage.","On slide 17, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years.  Since the first quarter of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 28%, driven by $18 billion of paydowns, $8 billion of asset sales, and $8 billion of net losses.","In the first quarter, we sold $2.8 billion of loans, including $1 billion of delinquent mortgages and $1.8 billion of current loans.  A significant portion of the current loans were reperforming mortgages, where we had previously modified the loan and it subsequently remained current.","While we are of course encouraged by the sale of these reperforming mortgages in the quarter, it is still unclear whether buyers will have an appetite for additional sales of this nature, and we will continue to test the market.","We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses in the portfolio, down 50% since the first quarter of 2011, to $630 million, even while roughly $76 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the continued actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments under the National Mortgage Settlement, or NMS.","We expect to fulfill our obligations under NMS in the second quarter.  However, we will continue to modify loans under the OCC Foreclosure Review Settlement announced last quarter, which we estimate will pull forward $30-40 million of losses into each quarter for the remainder of 2013.","On slide 18, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans.  30-plus day delinquencies improved by 19% sequentially to $6.1 billion, with improvement in both portfolios.  Residential first mortgage delinquencies fell 20% sequentially to $4.8 billion, driven by asset sales as well as fewer new entries into the early buckets.  And, home equity delinquencies also improved by 15% to $1.2 billion.","On slide 19, we show our net interest revenue and margin trends.  Net interest revenue was roughly flat year over year, at $11.9 billion, and declined 2% sequentially due to a lower day count.  Our net interest margin increased by 1 basis point to 294 basis points in the first quarter.","On a full year basis, we believe we should be able to maintain our net interest margin above the 288 basis points we achieved last year.  However, there will be quarterly fluctuations and in particular, we expect the net interest margin to decline sequentially in the second quarter by a few basis points.","On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics through the first quarter.  Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 9.3% versus 8.7% last quarter.  And, our Basel I tier one common ratio was 11.8%, including the impact of the market risk rules which became effective at the beginning of the quarter, up from 11.1% on a comparable basis last quarter.","In summary, our results for the first quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment, with spread compression globally and elevated legal and related cost remaining as headwinds.  Against this backdrop, we continue to grow our core business while beginning to reduce the earning drag from Citi Holdings.","In securities and banking, we again demonstrated our ability to grow revenues while keeping expense discipline.  And, in consumer banking and transaction services, we continued to grow loans and deposits year over year while maintaining a high quality credit portfolio.","In Citi Holdings, assets are now less than $150 billion, and the net loss was less than $800 million this quarter, even as we continue to face elevated legal and related costs.  And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of $370 billion and an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 9.3% at quarter end.","Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to grow volumes to compensate for the impact of the low interest rate environment, and we remain on track to achieve the $900 million of efficiency savings expected this year from our previously announced repositioning actions.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 Nomura","I like the disclosure.  On 17 you showed us that 60% NCLs were offset but loan loss reserve releases.  Between the sales and then just improving conditions in general, should we be thinking 60% offset is the right number, or should that grow over time as the portfolio shrinks and the market keeps getting better?","John Gerspach ","If the portfolio continues to demonstrate improving credit trends, and if the housing market remains stable, you should assume that we would likely increase that percentage coverage as we move through the year.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura ","The comment that you made earlier related to the tax rate in certain international entities, is that a comment on thoughts on repatriation?  I guess it\u2019s the same question.  Is it all related to what I think is a growing subsidiarization trend, meaning the U.S. pushes foreign banks to hold more capital in the U.S. now?  Are other markets doing that?  How much is that a risk that we should be thinking of, trapped capital around the world for you guys?","John Gerspach ","That is an ongoing area that I think everyone is looking at, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s driving this decision.  When you look at the requirements under APB 23, one of the things that you\u2019ve got to assert is that the capital in the offshore legal entities is to be permanently reinvested outside the states.  And specific legal entities, and think in terms of our bank in Singapore and our bank in Ireland, we\u2019ve built up now substantial capital.","And as you look at the capital levels, we have enough capital to meet the investment requirements that we see out into the future.  And so it\u2019s likely that at some point in time current earnings, and future earnings in those legal entities, could be repatriated into the states.  And therefore we\u2019re going to provide the U.S. taxes, and the differential between the U.S. tax rate and the local tax rate on those earnings.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura ","Post stress test, where you had super high capital ratios after the stress test, you have very high Basel III now, and growing pretty quickly.  That leads people towards getting really excited about next year\u2019s CCAR.  The question I have is how are the rating agencies thinking about removing some of the implicit government support and the OLA coming rules play into your role about Citi\u2019s ideal capital structure?","John Gerspach ","Those are all things that are developing and maybe will get further developed as 2013 unfolds.  For now, we\u2019re waiting to see what rules come out regarding OLA.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura ","Has there been any prefunding of it?  In other words, I thought I saw you do some subdebt issuance and your funding costs have come way down given your good performance.","John Gerspach ","To the extent that we\u2019ve had debt maturities, we\u2019ve rolled over some of those maturities, although we\u2019ve been in the process of reducing long term debt.  I think you\u2019ve seen us issue some preferred stock in the last couple of quarters.  You take a look at the capital structure we think preferred stock is a piece of that structure that we need to some issuance with as we think ahead to what the Basel III capital requirements are, not just for tier one common but also for tier one.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","John, on the expenses, I was wondering, you mentioned that on the core expenses about $11.5 billion, we should start to see those start to come down as you get the repositioning benefits?  Is there a new range of core expenses we should think about over the next couple of quarters?","John Gerspach ","No, we\u2019re staying with what we said at year-end, and you should expect, as we just said, to see the core expenses decline over the next couple of quarters.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","From that $11.5 billion?  Is that right?","John Gerspach ","Correct.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then on the legal repositioning side, I think you just said kind of volatile, and likely to remain elevated.  Is this the neighborhood we should kind of think about?  Or too tough to predict?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of too tough to predict.  I think if you take a look at legal expenses, though, what did we run last year?  $2.8 billion for the full year or something like that?  And now you\u2019ve got $700 million or so in the first quarter.  I\u2019ll leave it at that.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, so you\u2019re running at the same pace as last year.","John Gerspach ","Roughly.  On average.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then in terms of the net interest income, your net interest income dollars fell in the first quarter.  I assume there\u2019s some day count pressure.  And you mentioned the NIM outlook.  I was just wondering, though, if you hope to grow the net interest income dollars in 2013, given the earning asset expansion you\u2019re doing.  Do you expect the net interest income dollars to grow this year in 2013?  You were down on NII in the first quarter sequentially.","John Gerspach ","You know, I don\u2019t give net interest revenue outlooks.  That kind of gets into really going forward-looking.  On a day count basis, though, if you take a look at the average net interest revenue for us, it was about $132 million in the fourth quarter, and the same number in the first quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then last thing for me, on the DTA, can you give us some sense of the drivers of the consumption?  How much from improving just U.S. net income versus other factors that might have been at play?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, if you look at the moving pieces of the DTA, there\u2019s about $100 million of DTA that was actually added by the CVA\/DVA loss.  Citi Holdings losses added about $500 million of DTA, and then Citicorp earnings actually enabled us to consume about a billion dollars of DTA this quarter.  And then the balance of $300 million basically came out of OCI.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","So hard to run rate this, or to give an outlook I guess.  It will still bounce around a little bit?  Do you have any outlook on the consumption or ability to consume?","John Gerspach ","No, you have to think about it this way, as long as we can continue to do some growth in U.S. earnings, that should be helpful.  And that includes winding further wind downs in the Citi Holdings losses.  And also, the change in the APB 23 assertion, that change in the effective tax rate, on a dollar for dollar basis, those incremental taxes will also serve to offset the DTA.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And where do we stand at quarter-end?  Do you have the numbers with you?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s down about $700 million, off the $55.3 [billion].  So I guess that makes it $54.6 [billion].","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Just wanted to drill into the litigation charge, which went into SAP.  As you pointed out in that slide at the beginning, on the significant P&L items, at least in the comparable periods, most of those significant legal charges were in Citicorp.  And I think you were carrying them in corp and other, if I remember right.  So the change in the geography, to put it in SAP, kind of indicates that there\u2019s something related to the type of assets that are in SAP.  Could you tell us a little bit more about what the, I guess probably $500 million or so implicit in SAP in those litigation charges are?  And is it a reserve build?  Or is there something specific that you\u2019re dealing with there?","Mike Corbat ","We don\u2019t comment on specific legal accruals unless we\u2019re announcing a settlement of some sort.  But you think in terms of we certainly put the legal accruals in the business, during the segment, that is going to be impacted by the matter for which we\u2019re setting aside the legal reserves.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","If we look at the operating expenses in LCL, and we sort of look through some of the noise there, that\u2019s been running around a billion a quarter, and it came down to about $825 million.  Is that a step function that we should think about run rating as you are seeing meaningful reductions in, for example, foreclosure servicing and the like?","John Gerspach ","Certainly as we continue to sell off nonperforming loans, one of the benefits that we look to achieve by the sale of the nonperforming loans is to be able to bring down the servicing expenses on those loans.  I\u2019m not going to encourage you to necessarily run rate $825 million, but you can assume that one of the things that we aim to do through the loan sale is to target those loans that not only are producing higher levels of NCLs, but that come with them a higher level of servicing costs.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Turning to Citicorp, and looking at global consumer in North America, I know it\u2019s not a real big thing, but you\u2019ve sustained a pretty steady growth rate of commercial markets loan assets.  I think you\u2019re up almost 20% year over year, to over $8 billion.  Again, it\u2019s not huge when you put it in the context of some of your competitors, but it\u2019s a pretty significant growth rate.  Is this an area that you\u2019ve been targeting for much more significant loan growth?  And how are you doing that?","John Gerspach ","Actually, that\u2019s true.  That is an area that [CC] and her team have put particular focus on, over I\u2019ll say the last year, maybe it\u2019s been the last 15 months.  But that\u2019s definitely an area where we see an opportunity to expand.  And we\u2019ve grown both deposits and loans in that market.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And is it targeted to particular industries?  Is it largely branch-based?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s definitely branch-based, and there are certain industries that we have targeted.  I believe that, at least in the last couple of months, the small energy companies have been a particular standout for us.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Final question is just on the cautious commentary.  Mike said something like we\u2019re sure to be tested.  And I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything specific that he\u2019s looking at there that is giving him pause?","Mike Corbat ","I would say that as we look around the world, that you can just look at growth rate around the world and continue to see the world\u2019s a very uneven place, with growth rates in the emerging markets around 5%, growth rates in the developed market space around 1%.  And you can see the volatility and reactions, whether it\u2019s to slowing growth in China this morning, or whether it was Cypress issues.  And so I think the world continues to be somewhat of a fragile place, and I expect the markets to remain volatile.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Quick question on the long term debt.  You guys reduced it about $85 billion last year.  It\u2019s certainly been helpful to the margin.  With OLA, or anything else like that, do you see that slowing this year?  What\u2019s the outlook on the long term debt?","John Gerspach ","We\u2019ll give a little more perspective on that when we do the fixed income call next week, but I think you can already see some slowdown.  I believe end of period, long term debt only came down about $5 billion or so quarter on quarter.  So we\u2019re not quite at the pace that we were last year.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","So expect that sort of slower reduction from here?","John Gerspach ","It certainly is not going to be at the pace it was last year.  That\u2019s for sure.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And just maybe on the capital side, is it still expected that when you finalize the deal with Morgan Stanley on the JV, it would add around 30 to 40 basis points to your Basel III ratio?","John Gerspach ","Assuming that Morgan Stanley would call the entire 35%, yes.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And then lastly, as the mortgage environment continues to look better, the housing environment, is there any improved outlook on some of the discrete assets and holdings, like One Main?  Clearly profitability seems to be improving there.  But I don\u2019t know how you guys feel about the funding markets and the ability for someone to buy that.","Mike Corbat ","We continue to look at all those, and as you\u2019ve seen, when the prices and the terms are right, we\u2019ll act against that.  Clearly the recovery in housing helps, not just the mortgage portfolio, but also helps on the consumer side in general.  And so we continue to watch that, but we\u2019ve got no reaction today to plans there.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","A couple of questions.  One is, the S&B expense ratio posted a very low 49%.  I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about what a normalized expense ratio should be in that segment.","John Gerspach ","I think as we looked ahead, and you look out for 2015, we\u2019ve already given some degree of where we think the expense ratio should be longer term for securities and banking.  We said overall for Citicorp we would expect an efficiency ratio of 55%.  And I believe that embedded in that was an expense ratio less than 60% for securities and banking.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And the low ratio this quarter, you don\u2019t pay out on mark to market gains?  Is that right?","John Gerspach ","I think it\u2019s awfully hard to judge long term efficiency ratios on one quarter.  So there\u2019s always going to be revenues that don\u2019t repeat, and there\u2019s an expense base that\u2019s fixed, and all things to be that.  I\u2019d love to have four quarters strung together like the first quarter, but that\u2019s not the way we\u2019ve actually built the expense base.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then on the capital ratio, obviously strong increase this quarter, 50 basis points up in common share one, and [unintelligible] forward, it looks like you\u2019ll be significantly north of 9.5 obviously before year-end, as long as the long end of the curve doesn\u2019t move up too much.  So the question is, how do you think about using some of that capital?  And a two-part question.  One, would you have any interest in buying portfolios?  I know you can\u2019t buy depositories, but maybe assets?  And put some of the capital to work that way?","Mike Corbat ","A couple of things.  One is from a capital perspective you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll continue to build capital as we go through the year.  As I said in my operating remarks, I think that we should probably finish the year on a Basel III basis somewhere probably north of 10%.  I think we\u2019ll continue to look opportunistically at things out there.","So I think the Best Buy transaction was an example from a portfolio that we saw, and we thought it made sense from a business fit, from a credit profile, from a synergistic perspective with other parts of our business.  We\u2019ll continue to look for those situations as they present themselves, but nothing really too overt in terms of being aggressively on an asset purchase perspective.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And if something did come up, and you had to choose between doing something that made sense for you from an acquisition perspective versus hitting the 10% plus at year-end, does the 10% matter?  Is that the primary goal?","Mike Corbat ","I think the 10% does matter.  What we know is we know that the 9.5% is a real number.  What we don\u2019t know today is we don\u2019t know what the right buffer is, because we don\u2019t know what it means to be above or below the 9.5%.  So I think we would certainly look at any opportunities with a balanced eye towards those things we think make sense for the intermediate and longer term versus the shorter term capital tradeoff.  Tough to say.  We\u2019d have to look at the situation.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then just lastly, would you have any interest in going back and asking the regulators for an additional buyback request over and above what you were granted in March this year, in this calendar year?","Mike Corbat ","This calendar year?  No.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","First, a couple of specific questions, then one broader question.  What is your tier one Basel III common target?","John Gerspach ","Two things.  One is we\u2019ve said that we expect to end the year above 10%, and I think what Mike just said is we think 10% is a reasonable figure to think about right now, just as we\u2019re trying to assess what is the appropriate level of buffer to have or maybe not have above 9.5%.  But right now we\u2019re thinking in terms of 10% overall.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Does that expectation include the 30 to 40 basis points from the sale of the rest of the joint venture?","John Gerspach","No, in order to finish the year, Mike\u2019s numbers, as far as being above 10%, that doesn\u2019t require Morgan Stanley to call the entire 35%.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","So that would be a bonus on top of the 10%, if it happens.","John Gerspach ","Yeah, let me just be very clear.  We do expect Morgan Stanley to at least call the 15%, which is due this year.  We\u2019re not counting on them calling the additional 20%.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Separately, you mentioned repatriation.  Is that part of your tax planning strategy, so that you can use more of the DTA?","John Gerspach ","No, repatriation of the earnings that we\u2019re applying the taxes on doesn\u2019t really involve the DTA.  By providing the taxes, we\u2019re driving down the DTA.  If we were to dividend those earnings, that could provide a little bit of a benefit, perhaps, in the actual utilization against the foreign tax credits.  But that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re actively planning on right now.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then lastly, a question for Mike.  This is the first conference call since the March 5 announcement about the longer term positioning.  And on the March 5 call, you said we\u2019ve got to prove the value of our model.  And I was wondering how you would see evidence of that proof.","Mike Corbat ","Well, I think if you look at all the operating aspects of our model in this quarter, markets and banking, CTS, consumer, I think all had reasonable to better than reasonable quarters.  I think if you look at both from an absolute perspective, and importantly from a relative perspective, on the banking side of things we can continue to grow market share, which is an important approach to how we look at the increasing value of our franchise.","And I think importantly, what we\u2019ve done is, John showed in one of the slides sequential growth that we\u2019ve actually shown in our markets and banking businesses, as well as our consumer businesses over a reasonably extended time period.  And so I think the business has performed well, and I think we\u2019ve shown this quarter a good sample of when the franchise performs right, what value it can drive.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","As a follow up, I agree, the numbers beat consensus.  The stock\u2019s up 3%.  But the stock\u2019s still down 90% pre-crisis.  The ROE, with all the encouraging signs, is still only 8% versus 20% before the crisis.  So when we look back, say in two or three years, what would be the larger evidence that proves the value of the model?","Mike Corbat ","I think you\u2019ve got to really separate a couple of things in there.  One is the numbers that you\u2019re citing, and appropriately so, are inclusive of the drag of Citi Holdings.  And so again, one of the things that we\u2019re focused on is reducing assets, reducing that drag, and as we go forward we will hopefully see some of those things get behind us.  I think as Betsy said, we did hit some fairly robust efficiency ratios out of parts of our markets businesses in other places, and so we\u2019d like to take what is happening in one quarter and continue to build on that and create more sustainability around it.  So I think those would be good milestones of progress.","John Gerspach ","And we\u2019ve laid those things out as far as the targets that we\u2019ve got on the table for 2015, both from an efficiency goal point of view in Citicorp and then ROA and ROTCE targets for Citigroup.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","So is it fair to say those three targets will ultimately be the proof of the value of the model?","John Gerspach ","At least the value of the model up through 2015.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","A couple of questions to clarify what\u2019s been talked about so far.  Just on the repatriation of foreign earnings into the U.S., I know you talked about the DTA impact of that a little bit, but I just wasn\u2019t totally clear.  If that were to happen, that does lower DTA, correct?","John Gerspach ","By providing the tax, the U.S. tax, we\u2019ve already lowered the DTA.  Let\u2019s just work through an example.  If I\u2019ve got earnings in a legal entity that has a 12.5% tax rate, like in Ireland, and I have no intention of repatriating those earnings, they\u2019re going to be permanently reinvested outside, the only tax expense that would hit the P&L would be the 12.5% local tax.","Now what we\u2019re saying is current and future earnings out of that legal entity could be repatriated.  They could be dividended back into the States at some point in time, which means now that you would need to provide the differential between the 35% statutory U.S. rate and the 12.5% local rate.  So that 22.5% incremental tax that we\u2019re providing is both an income tax expense that is impacting the P&L.  You see it reflected in our effective tax rate.  And because it\u2019s a U.S. tax provision, it serves to reduce the DTA.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, so it\u2019s helping you right now whether or not you actually repatriate the earnings?","John Gerspach ","That\u2019s correct.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And just another follow up question.  In the beginning comments, you laid out the three targets for 2015 and then said you won\u2019t reach these on a full year basis.  Did you mean full year in 2013?  Or full year 2015?  What was that comment?","John Gerspach ","Those are targets that Mike set out a month ago for the performance of the franchise for the year 2015.  Those are our targets.  We want to get Citicorp efficiency ratio at 55% or better.  We want to drive for Citigroup a return on tangible common of 10% or better.  And a return on average assets for Citigroup between 90 and 110 basis points.  Those are the targets that we are still working towards.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then separately, it\u2019s hard to put you on the spot here a little bit, but we\u2019ve had a very big move in certain commodities the last couple of days.  And I know you guys have significantly reduced that business broadly speaking within your [fic] areas a couple of years ago.  But are you sensitive to big price swings in some of these commodity prices out there?","John Gerspach ","Not really.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","A couple of questions on the decline in delinquency in North America mortgage within NCL.  I think you guys said that a billion dollars was in sales.  Was the rest primarily in charge offs?","John Gerspach ","Let\u2019s just go over the numbers. We did about $2.8 billion of sales in the quarter.  About a $1 billion of those were for delinquent loans.  And the other $1.8 would be current loans.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","The delinquent loans are down 40 basis points in the linked quarter.  So that\u2019s $1.4-ish, right?  So a billion bucks was in sales.  So was the rest chargeoffs?","John Gerspach ","Some of it was chargeoffs, some of it was just an improvement in delinquency trends.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","How did that break down?  Was it primarily chargeoffs?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t have that.  I\u2019m sorry.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","And then in the sales of the loans at this point, what kind of discount is necessary to sell those loans at this point?  And how would that flow through the P&L?","John Gerspach ","Well, actually on some of the sales that we\u2019ve done, we did it at book value or above.  So those don\u2019t really have a loss associated with them.  In general, I would say it\u2019s going to be different for every tranche of sale that you do, because every tranche is a different point in the delinquency spectrum.  And so depending upon the quality of the loan, where it\u2019s delinquent, is it a modified loan, you\u2019re going to get a different discount rate.","We did see an improvement in pricing this quarter, though.  I\u2019d say that basically across the entire spectrum of mortgage loan sales that we looked at, I would say that pricing improved somewhere between 5% and 10% percentage points higher this quarter compared to similar activity that we would have been looking at in the fourth quarter.   ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","And I think you mentioned that you\u2019ve got $3 billion in other that is basically loans that are available for sale that you\u2019re in the process of selling.  Is that similar to the $2.8? A mix of delinquent and current mortgage?","John Gerspach ","Some of that $3 billion is the $2.8.  In other words, when we enter into a contract to sell loans, let\u2019s say mortgage loans, we would take those loans then out of the mortgage portfolio and move them in the held for sale.  It\u2019s not available for sale.  It\u2019s held for sale.  So these are transactions where we\u2019ve got a signed contract, we just haven\u2019t closed as yet.  So some portion of the $2.8 billion of mortgage sales that I referenced in the period, some of that is in the held for sale account and will be cleared out by the end of this month.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","And for these sales, the delinquent mort, does that have a lot to do with, I think on a Basel III basis, RWAs within holdings dropped somewhere around $6 billion.  Was a lot of that driven by these sales?  Or were there other factors going on?  Could you kind of lay that out too?","John Gerspach ","When we look at doing a sale of any asset in holdings, I think Mike has talked about this, especially when it\u2019s a delinquent mortgage, you look at it as far as what\u2019s the level of expected future credit losses that we expect on that mortgage, what\u2019s the cost of servicing that mortgage, and clearly a component of it would be what are the capital costs associated with continuing to hold that mortgage.  So we look at all of those various aspect of it.  I think if you looked as far as the drop in the Basel III assets for this quarter, it\u2019s probably a little bit heavily weighted towards the SAP portfolio again as opposed to the LCL portfolio.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","The pending sale of the Turkish operations, is there anything that we can think about as far as expectation for operating expense declines on the back of that?","John Gerspach ","I think what we said in the press release is this is not a material transaction.  You\u2019ll see some drop off in revenue, you\u2019ll see some drop off in expenses, but it\u2019s not material.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jeffery Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  ","It may be a bit nitpicky, but looking at the international consumer loan growth, 4% year over year is quite a bit lower than we have been seeing.  Sometimes north of 7%.  Can you talk a little bit about what appears to be a declining growth rate in the international consumer loan business?","Mike Corbat ","I think you\u2019ve got two different drivers.  What you may want to do is in the investor deck, if you go back to one of the pages that we have in the appendix, slide 29, and we actually break out the various drivers in constant dollars, split by region.  And I think what you\u2019re going to see is a little bit of a different story, depending upon the region.  If you look at it, we\u2019re still getting, I think, reasonable growth in Latin America.  L","Latin America, it slowed down a little bit in the first quarter, as primary the Mexican economy slowed down a little bit.  But you still, on a sequential basis, and you take a look at the average loans, we\u2019re still growing card loans.  And there\u2019s some seasonality.  Normally you\u2019re going to have a little bit of a lower first quarter anyway.  So we\u2019re still getting growth in Latin America out of cards and the retail banking loans.","The issue for us remains Asian.  And if you stay on that same slide 29, and take a look at Asia, on an average card basis, it\u2019s flat.  And quite frankly, you\u2019d go back to the first quarter of 2012 and we have flat average loans.  You\u2019re looking at 19.7, 19.8, 19.7, 19.8.  And then you take a look at the retail bank average loans, and again, they\u2019re flat.  So we\u2019re getting growth in some of the countries in Asia.  We\u2019re getting decent growth in Hong Kong, in Singapore.  The issue, and I hate to keep bringing it up, Korea is a drag on us right now.  And it\u2019s one that we just have to work our way through.","Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  ","Tough to quantify, I know, but looking at securities and banking, a good quarter, maybe some of the trading not up year over year.  We\u2019ve kind of been conditioned recently to see a big drop off in activity levels in the second quarter.  As we see other things like better pricing in the North American mortgage loan portfolio when you\u2019re selling, can you give any color or insight into what you\u2019re seeing as far as risk appetites by investing clients out there?","Mike Corbat ","I think clearly a lot of the stance of the central banks out there, and the availability of credit, I think we, through the first quarter, continued to see risk [gone].  I think if you look at the underlying dynamics of the business, you know first quarter 2012 was a terrific quarter in terms of G10 rates in currencies.  This first quarter\u2019s strong performance in terms of our securitization revenues, in particular in North America, I think as well as pretty good contributions out of our local markets in FX businesses.","So I think a good mix there, but I think as you see in the securitization markets, and some of the robustness there, and I think if you look at the calendar, clearly there\u2019s an appetite for people and their willingness to put on credit risk here.","So we saw that through the first quarter, but as I said, the world, I think, remains a challenging place, and you can just see, in some near term moves, when you get a Cypress, or you get certain things, investors do have the tendency to pull back pretty quickly from the markets when those situations arrive.  So I think we\u2019re going to have to watch that carefully.","Jeffery Harte - Sandler O\u2019Neill  ","And finally, the North American mortgage portfolio.  The delinquencies got a lot better sequentially.  Could you give us any kind of thinking on what might be a more normalized level of losses in that portfolio?  I\u2019m trying to just get maybe a feel for how much better you think things can theoretically get, credit wise, in that portfolio.","John Gerspach ","I\u2019m not going to be able to give any forward guidance as to where we think a normalized rate is in the holdings mortgage portfolio.  We do see, as you can see, the credit performance is improving.  And if you go back to one of the slides that we\u2019ve got in there, slide 17, you can see that we\u2019ve seen credit losses continue to decline in that portfolio.  And we would expect to see declining losses into the future, but I can\u2019t give you a \u201cnormalized\u201d rate on this particular portfolio.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse  ","Not to beat the North America mortgage to death, but can you tell us how much of the portfolio you think would be saleable at or above book value?","John Gerspach ","No, I can\u2019t.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","You had previously talked about the average life of the portfolio.  I\u2019m assuming with the sales and such that the average life is declining.  Is that fair?","John Gerspach ","I have to tell you, I haven\u2019t even tested the guys on what they now think the average life is.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","I guess the reason I\u2019m asking is as the number of months of coverage goes up, if the average life is coming down, it seems like the two of those are going both in the right direction, and one should be eating into the other pretty aggressively at this point.","John Gerspach ","If the average life is coming down, I would agree with you.  I just don\u2019t know that right now.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And you kind of addressed a couple of questions ago about the growth in consumer loans in Asia a little bit.  Anything else in terms of programs or things that you\u2019ve got to kind of show better results in parts of that?  Are there any things we can kind of talk about?","John Gerspach ","When you talk about programs\u2026","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","I mean, are there parts of the portfolio that you\u2019re seeing any kind of better results?","John Gerspach ","Yeah.  I would say in a lot of Asia, and I think I called out before Singapore and Hong Kong, we are seeing good, sustained growth, you know, in the 8-10% range, for revenues.  And you can see growth in some of the key drivers there as well.  But there\u2019s just a lot of different countries.  I mentioned Korea before.  But it\u2019s not just Korea.  There\u2019s deleveraging, there are regulatory constraints being put on in several countries throughout Asia.","And so we\u2019re facing some headwinds in Australia, in Taiwan, and in Korea as well.  One item that I think will help us later in this year, we can begin card sales again in Indonesia beginning next month.  And so that\u2019s a market that we\u2019ve been limited in for the last two years.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Fred Cannon - KBW","I just wanted to kind of refocus a little bit on the North American mortgage operations of Citicorp.  I know you did ramp up the originations quite a bit over the last year, around $18 but in the latest quarter.  However, at the same time, the servicing portfolio continues to decline, and I don\u2019t see any additions to the size of the mortgage portfolio in Citicorp.  And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what you see there, and are you planning to try to increase your market share Citicorp and mortgage?","John Gerspach ","Mortgage for us is not a big business.  We\u2019re very focused on executing on the mortgages for our retail banking customers.  So as we\u2019ve looked at a lot of the mortgage origination so far, it\u2019s really been more heavily weighted towards our branch business than anything else.  But as you\u2019ve seen, the rate loss volume that we put through in the first quarter, it actually is down slightly year over year, and it was up a bit from the fourth quarter.  But the mix is very heavily weighted towards our branch operations.","Fred Cannon - KBW ","Okay, so there\u2019s no kind of reemphasis to try to earn more money in that sector?","John Gerspach ","No, we\u2019re not looking to significantly grow share in mortgages, other than with our existing retail banking base.","Fred Cannon - KBW ","And then just quickly, I was wondering if there was any impact in the quarter from the appreciation of the Japanese yen.","John Gerspach ","There certainly is, but from an overall point of view, if you take a look at both the impact of the yen, the peso strengthening, overall, the FX impact on our EBIT is zero.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer","Two questions on your Latin American business.  First is on page 10, where you show the 90 days past due.  And they seem to be coming down steadily, but the chargeoff level is staying high.  So I\u2019m curious what is the dynamic?  Is there something unusual going on there?  And then the second question is on Friday there was a Dow Jones news story that you were looking to sell the Brazilian credit card business.  I wonder if you could comment on that.  Is that business part of Citicorp?  Or Holdings?  And I would have thought Brazilian credit cards would be pretty core.","Mike Corbat ","It\u2019s a lot of questions.  Brazilian cards is part of Citicorp.  We don\u2019t comment on newspaper musings.  Regarding the delinquencies in the NCLs, in Latin America, we have had a bit of an increase in the NCLs, and that\u2019s primarily been due to the seasoning that we\u2019ve had in certain credit card portfolios in Mexico.","And so we understand that the NCLs are a bit elevated right now, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve kind of grown to that 4.6% that is on one of those slides.  But we do believe that by the second half of the year, the overall NCL rate in Latin America should normalize at around 4.5%.  So we don\u2019t see that as being a continuing upward trend.","And I think if you look at some of those statistics, when we gave you the 90-plus days past due, you can see the fact that in Latin America, the 90-plus has either been kind of flat from a cards point of view, or it\u2019s actually been improving in the retail banking business.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","That was my question.  The delinquencies were down and the chargeoffs were flat.  It\u2019s not a pattern you normally see.","Mike Corbat ","Yeah, it\u2019s just a seasoning of some large credit card portfolios in Mexico.  But that should all settle out by the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just to focus on Korea, is there anything in the recent activity going on in Korea that has you more worried about the potential for \u201cfixing\u201d Korea in the timeframe you\u2019ve been talking about over the last six to nine months?","Mike Corbat ","No, not really.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then it does sound a little bit as if you are a bit more hopeful of the possibility of selling assets out of holdings, but at this point, it\u2019s still a little uncertain as to the potential investor or buyer demand.  Did I hear that correctly?","Mike Corbat ","Yes.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then I guess just quickly in terms of the mortgage market, can you give us any indication in terms of you mentioned a little bit about the focus on that business relative to the branch population.  Do you have any metrics you can provide us in terms of what percentage of that population you\u2019re currently serving in terms of mortgages and where you\u2019d like to get?  And as mortgages decline, how should we think about the operating costs in that business coming down?","Mike Corbat ","I can\u2019t give you any statistics.  I don\u2019t have anything with me that would point towards potential penetration of the retail banking client base for mortgages.  I\u2019m sorry.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I just had one on capital return.  Clearly with the very positive stress test result behind you, and you mentioning that your Basel III tier one common will likely be above 10% at the end of the year, how should we think about the midterm progression of capital return?  Should we assume a more gradual increase in your payout ratios?  Or is there a possibility of a larger stair step next year given your excess capital positioning?","Mike Corbat ","I think right now it\u2019s early to call that.  Clearly one of the things that is important in this is not just the quantity, but the quality of earnings.  And I think as we go through the year, and that makes itself more transparent, that will probably dictate how we think about that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Mike, you mentioned the things that slowed down a little bit with Cypress, or had an impact.  How have the first two weeks of this quarter been, given Cypress, etc., from a trading standpoint?","Mike Corbat ","I would say certainly slower than the very fast start to the year.  Volumes are decent.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan ","Because the slowdown started in March.  So from March have we seen things improve a little bit?  Or still steadyish to where it was in March.","Mike Corbat ","It\u2019s a little hard to go week to week.  We had a reasonably good quarter in the first quarter.  I don\u2019t think that April looks like January.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan ","John, I have a question for you, just to follow up on the Latin America question that came up earlier.  Early delinquencies in Latin America seem to be up pretty sharply.  In retail loans they were up 20% linked quarter.  How does that square with your outlook for losses coming down back to 4.5% given the sharp jump?","John Gerspach ","Beautiful question, Vivek.  If you take a look at that page 15 in the supplement, where you see those increases?  Go back to the third quarter, and you\u2019re going to see a similar increase in the third quarter.  There is a mortgage book of business in Mexico that we actually operate through payroll accounts.  But they\u2019re on a 60-day payment schedule.  So we get a payment every other month.","So you\u2019re going to see some variability in the delinquencies as you move from the first quarter, where we get a payment in February, to the second quarter, where we get payments then in April and June.  And so by the end of June, the delinquencies are back to where you would normally expect them to be.  They\u2019ll rise again in September, and they\u2019ll decline again in December.  So it all has to do with that one mortgage portfolio in Mexico.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan ","I have one last question for you, John, which is the comp to revenue ratio in the first quarter of \u201913.  Can you give me a sense of what that was and what your full year target is for 2013?  Either you or Mike on that full year target that one of the?","Mike Corbat ","No, we don\u2019t comment on comp ratios.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","A couple of questions.  First, on the legal costs, I know they\u2019re legacy legal costs, and they\u2019re very lumpy and hard to predict.  Can you guys tell us, is there a statute of limitations?  Has it run out on all those legacy problems?  Or is there still potential for new litigation that could add to those lumpy legal costs?","Mike Corbat ","The one thing that you have to assume is that the legal community is very creative, and so I would say that there always is the opportunity for additional litigation, even in matters that you might otherwise think would have passed the statute of limitations.  I don\u2019t think lawyers have statute of limitations.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","My other question was your cost of funding obviously improved this quarter, and when you look at your deposits, and recognizing you have more of a global footprint than the two big banks that reported on Friday.  But even still, their cost of funding for their deposits is about a third of yours.  Do you think we could see yours fall meaningfully over the next 12 to 18 months, as the outlook improves for Citigroup?","Mike Corbat ","Are you talking about deposits specifically?","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Yes.  You\u2019re at 73 basis points, and they average about 25.","Mike Corbat ","Well, don\u2019t forget, a lot of what you\u2019re probably looking at from a peer institution, they would be operating in the U.S. and in the U.S. environment.  We have a much more global deposit base.  And so even though we\u2019re dealing with a rather low interest rate environment around the world, a low interest rate environment in the U.S. is going to be different than a low interest rate environment in, say, Mexico.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Moving on to credit, I noticed in the nonperforming asset page, or your nonaccrual page, there was an uptick in the corporate nonaccrual loans in Citigroup.  What was that due to?","John Gerspach ","A couple of hundred million dollars or something like that?  You\u2019re always going to have a little bit of an episodic increase or an episodic decrease.  There\u2019s nothing really there.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then finally, you mentioned about Asia and the impact that Korea is having on that business.  What percentage is Korea as a percentage of the loan balances in your Asia portfolio?","John Gerspach ","Well, I can\u2019t give you the exact percentage, but you\u2019ll get a glimpse of that.  We\u2019ve got a page in the back of the book, I think it\u2019s page 32, that will actually give you the amount of loans that we have in key countries.  And so in the consumer loans, Korea comprises about $24 billion of our consumer loan book.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","I had a question on expenses.  It was helpful in terms of talking about positive operating leverage expected this year for Latin America, Asia, in consumer and [GTS].  How should we think about North America consumer?  What do we need to see happen before we get to see positive operating leverage there?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got to get more revenue production out of the U.S. card businesses.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And any idea in terms of the timing or higher rates required as well?","John Gerspach ","I think it\u2019s a business that we\u2019re in the process of repositioning.  I think that you take a look at the U.S. consumer, there\u2019s a decent amount of deleveraging still underway.  I certainly don\u2019t see any releveraging necessarily on the part of the U.S. consumer, other than refinancing mortgage loans and perhaps taking out more student lending.  Maybe auto loans a little bit.  We\u2019re not really in that business.  But from our point of view, getting more growth in the revolving balances, that\u2019s going to be a challenge over the course of the next couple of quarters.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And in terms of the expense savings that you\u2019ve previously laid out, and you were targeting 900 for this year.  How much of that, if any, has been realized in the first quarter?","John Gerspach ","There\u2019s just a very small amount of that that\u2019s actually been realized in the first quarter.  A lot of the people that have been notified to date, they exit beginning in March, and there\u2019s a 60-day notice period.  And so those are savings that will accrue more towards the latter half of the year.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then in terms of just the backdrop, as Mike had laid out early on, in terms of things still challenging and perhaps a little bit tougher, are there more levers to pull beyond the [one one] savings that you\u2019ve already laid out, if indeed things are worse?  How should we think about that?","Mike Corbat ","We\u2019re focused on really trying to manage expenses in terms of BAU, and trying to get more efficiencies into the business.  We recently announced that we\u2019ve brought somebody in externally to help us do that.  The businesses are going to be focused on that.  So we\u2019re mindful of the environment, clearly with an eye towards the expense side of things, but today we\u2019re not going to talk about any big levers.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then a couple of [ticky tack] questions.  In the corporate other line, sequentially, in your slide deck, page 13, you had mentioned how linked quarter, revenue improvement was less negative this quarter versus last.  I guess partly driven by hedging activities.  What was that?  And how should we think about that going forward?","John Gerspach ","Hedging activities is something that\u2019s very difficult to predict.  I think you\u2019ll see that we end up with some fluctuation in that line all the time, and this is where we have some macro hedges against elements of the business.  But it\u2019s very difficult to predict.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","Is that positive meaningfully this quarter?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t have a huge positive feeling in my head about it.  I just don\u2019t have the information in front of me.  I\u2019m sorry.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then the last is just on liquidity continues to be pretty strong.  Do you have your actual LCR ratio handy?  I think last quarter maybe it was around 118?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, I think we actually ended last quarter at 122.  I think we estimated it at 118 at the point in time we did the call, and then when the calculation was finalized, it actually increased.  And we\u2019re in the process still of doing those calculations, so I don\u2019t have a comparable figure in front of me at this point in time.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And do you have a target for that?  Will that drift lower as you deploy excess liquidity?  Since you\u2019re already well above the required.","John Gerspach ","What we\u2019ve said is that certainly from where it was, when it was above 122, we said that it could drift somewhat lower.  But again, this is another one of these ratios where the minimum requirement is 100%.  And so we need to maintain some buffer above that 100%, just in order to be sure that you\u2019re not going to pierce it at some point in time.  We haven\u2019t formalized exactly where we want to set that buffer.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Susan Kendall","Thank you all for joining us today.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the second quarter of 2013. Excluding CVA and DVA net income was $3.9 billion or $1.25 per share.","Overall, we had strong, high-quality earnings, which were well-balanced across our products and geographies. As you know, generating such results consistently is one of my top priorities.","Although volatility did increase in June, we had good performance across our securities and banking businesses during the quarter. Our transaction service business continues to be impacted by spread compression, as does our global consumer bank. However, we did grow our loans in our core businesses in a disciplined manner, particularly in the emerging markets, and we did so while maintaining a high-quality portfolio.","Our capital position strengthened, and our tier one common ratio increased to an estimated 10% on a Basel III basis, and we believe our firm is well-positioned for the regulatory requirements regarding capital and leverage ratios, although they\u2019ve not yet been finalized.","We continue to make progress in two critical areas: Reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings, and the utilization of our deferred tax asset. We reduced our assets in City Holdings by $18 billion, and holdings assets now total just under $131 billion, and are less than 7% of our GAAP balance sheet.","This was the largest percentage reduction in assets since 2010, and it was driven not only by Morgan Stanley\u2019s purchase of the remaining 35% stake of the MSSB joint venture, but also by continued opportunistic sales, including over $3 billion of U.S. mortgages, bringing the total year to date to nearly $6 billion.","More significantly, the loss in holdings was reduced to less than $600 million for the quarter. In fact, holdings actually made a small profit when you exclude the impact of legal, rep, and warranty costs. Associated legal costs will likely remain elevated in the near term, but we took another significant step to get past legacy issues with our rep and warranty agreement with Fannie Mae.","Regarding DTA, we again consumed a modest amount during the second quarter; $600 million of DTA was utilized, bringing the total to $1.3 billion for the first half of the year. We also made good progress executing the repositioning plans we announced at the end of last year.","Among other actions, just after the end of the quarter, we closed the sale of our consumer businesses in Turkey and Romania, and reached an agreement to sell our consumer business in Uruguay.","We\u2019re on track to realize about $900 million of expense savings this year, and $1.2 billion next year, due to these and our other repositioning actions. Looking to the second half of the year, it\u2019s unclear whether the market volatility that emerged in the second quarter will continue, and if so to what degree.","Low short term rates continue to be a headwind against our deposit taking and accrual businesses such as consumer banking and transaction services, and in the U.S., although the housing market is gaining strength, the lower volume of mortgage refinancing will impact our consumer business. We\u2019re already taking steps to make sure the mortgage business is sized correctly.","While still outpacing developed markets, emerging market growth slowed, but we remain very disciplined about to whom we\u2019ll offer credit in light of our targeted segments. As the Brazil credit card transaction indicates, we\u2019ve managed our risk profile carefully in every country we do business, and our target clients are stable, whether they be multinational corporates or high credit quality consumers.","John Gerspach will now go through the deck, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. So with that, over to you, John.","John Gerspach ","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were positive $477 million pretax, and $293 million after tax in the second quarter, for a positive impact on EPS of $0.09.","For comparison purposes, in the second quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were positive $219 million pretax, or $140 million after tax, for a positive impact of $0.05 per share. In addition, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax loss of $424 million related to the sale of minority investments, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.09 per share in that quarter.","Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2013, or $1.25 per share, as compared to $1 per share on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2012. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding CVA and DVA, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments to provide comparability to prior periods.","In addition, as we show on slide four, there are a few other items which are included in our results. First, operating expenses in the second quarter included legal and related costs of over $800 million, compared to roughly $700 million last quarter, and nearly $500 million in the prior year.","Legal and related costs at Citicorp were roughly $130 million in the second quarter, mostly in corporate other, while Citi Holdings legal expenses remained elevated, at roughly $700 million, primarily reflected in the special asset pool.","Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us. Second, repositioning costs were $75 million in the second quarter, compared to $148 million in the first quarter of 2013, and $186 million in the second quarter of last year.","We expect to have some level of repositioning charges each quarter, but we are working to incorporate these actions into the daily management of our business. So, going forward, we would not expect to take large, episodic charges as we did in the fourth quarter of last year.","And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the second quarter was $784 million, including a release of roughly $525 million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings. The net reserve release was $650 million in the prior quarter, and $1 billion in the second quarter of last year.","On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $20 billion grew 8% from last year, driven by securities and banking, while operating expenses of $12.1 billion increased 1%, reflecting the higher legal and related costs in Citi Holdings.","Credit costs of $2 billion declined 25% year over year. Net credit losses of $2.6 billion were down 25%, and, as I noted earlier, the loan loss reserve release was also lower versus last year. We earned $3.9 billion of net income in the second quarter, or $1.25 per share, up from $1 per share last year on a comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by higher legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.","Our effective tax rate was also higher in the second quarter, at 33% versus 20% last year, reflecting higher earnings in North America, a higher effective tax rate on international operations due to the previously disclosed change in our assertion surrounding the permanent reinvestment of earnings in certain international entities, and the resolution of certain tax issues in the second quarter. We expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 30%.","Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year over year, to $644 billion in the second quarter, as growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the wind down of Citi Holdings. And deposits grew 3% to $938 billion.","Turning to Citigroup expenses on slide six, in addition to the legal and related and the repositioning costs I discussed earlier, in the second quarter we recorded a $60 million charge for the estimated impact of the Fed\u2019s proposed supervisory assessment on large banks. This fee is expected to be retroactive to the beginning of 2012, so the $60 million charge represents the cumulative impact of six quarters of assessments.","Excluding this fee, core operating expenses declined roughly 1% in constant dollars, both year over year and sequentially. Year over year, the expense decline reflects approximately $200 million of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher performance-based compensation expense.","And, sequentially, the expense decline reflects approximately $100 million of incremental repositioning savings, as well as lower performance-based compensation expense compared to the first quarter, partially offset by higher marketing and transaction-related costs. We remain on track to achieve approximately $900 million of repositioning savings, full year 2013, with a run rate of approximately $1.2 billion beginning in 2014.","On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated second quarter revenues of $18.9 billion, and net income of $4.5 billion. Year over year, revenues grew 7%, and expenses declined by 2%, driven by lower legal and related expenses.","Credit costs in Citicorp increased modestly year over year, as the decline in net credit losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases. Citicorp loans increased by 4% year over year. Consumer loans grew 1%, as growth in international loans was mostly offset by a decline in North America. And corporate loans were up 7%, including the impact of adding approximately $7 billion of previously unconsolidated assets. Excluding this item, corporate loans would have increased 4% year over year.","Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were $1.1 billion and the net loss was $579 million in the second quarter, an improvement from prior periods driven by a continued decline in credit costs. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $131 billion of assets, down $60 billion, or 31%, year over year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 7% of total Citigroup assets.","Turning now to Citicorp, our growth in the second quarter was broad-based across the region, as shown here on slide eight. In North America, revenues grew 7% year over year to $8.2 billion, driven mostly by improved securities and banking performance, while expenses and net credit losses declined, offset by a lower reserve release as credit continued to normalize.","In Asia, revenues grew 7% to $4 billion, mostly reflecting securities and banking, although we also grew consumer revenues while reducing expenses.","In Latin America, our business is weighted more to consumer, which drove 8% growth in revenues to $3.5 billion. Expenses grew on higher volumes and credit costs were also up year over year, primarily reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning. However, we still grew earnings in the region.","And in EMEA, our business is weighted more to the institutional franchise, which continued to perform well, driving 8% revenue growth to $3.1 billion.","We generated solid revenue growth across each geography, with overall expense discipline and stable to improving credit quality, resulting in pretax earnings of over $1 billion in each region.","Turning to slide nine, we show the composition of Citicorp revenues and pretax earnings by region, before the impact of loan loss reserves. These results also exclude corp other. For the first half of 2013, 43% of Citicorp\u2019s revenues, and nearly half of pretax earnings, were generated in the emerging markets. The higher relative profitability in the emerging markets reflects a lower cost base as well as the predominantly flow-driven nature of our institutional franchise in these markets.","Slide 10 shows the historical trend for Citicorp revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, with emerging markets contributing over two-thirds of Citicorp\u2019s total revenue growth over the past two years.","In the last 12 months, Citicorp generated $32 billion of revenues in emerging markets. Over half of these revenues were generated in the consumer business, where we target a high-quality consumer segment largely based in the major cities. And, the remainder was institutional, predominantly serving our large, multinational clients as they fund their local operations, manage currency needs, and move payments around the world.","Turning to slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars, including the impact of moving our credit card business in Brazil to discontinued operations in each period. On this basis, revenues grew 5% year over year, while expenses grew 1%.","In Latin America, revenues grew 8%, and expenses were up 4% from last year. In Asia, revenues returned to growth, up 2% year over year, while expenses were down 2%. And, in EMEA, revenues grew 2%, with a 1% decline in expenses. While international consumer revenues continue to reflect spread compression in certain markets, as well as the impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the second quarter.","Total average loans grew 5% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 9%, and investment sales grew 36% year over year. Both Latin America and Asia returned to positive operating leverage for the first half of 2013, and we expect to maintain this performance for the rest of the year.","Credit costs of $751 million in the second quarter were up 19% from last year, on higher net credit losses due mostly to loan growth and portfolio seasoning. The loan loss reserve build was also higher this quarter, at $123 million, driven by portfolio growth as well as builds for specific credits and our commercial market businesses. Despite higher credit costs, positive operating leverage drove a 7% increase in earnings before tax to $1.2 billion.","Slide 12 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the second quarter were down 1% year over year. Retail banking revenues of $1.6 billion declined by 4%, reflecting lower mortgage origination and servicing revenues, as well as continued spread compression, partially offset by a gain of roughly $180 million on the sale of an on-balance sheet mortgage portfolio. This sale of approximately $2.5 billion of conforming loans was opportunistic, given the favorable market environment earlier in the quarter.","Cards revenues of $3.5 billion were flat versus last year, as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an improvement in net interest spreads. On a sequential basis, net interest spreads were up slightly in Citi branded cards, while spreads were lower in retail services, driven by a higher percentage of deferred interest promotional balances.","Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down both year over year and sequentially, reflecting lower legal and related costs versus the prior year, and lower repositioning costs versus last quarter.","Credit costs of roughly $850 million increased 19% year over year. Net credit losses declined by 21% to $1.2 billion, driven by an improvement in cards. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower at $351 million this quarter, compared to $814 million last year.","Overall, while we faced mortgage and spread related headwinds in North America this quarter that are likely to continue, we also saw some progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continued to grow, up 9% year over year, including 16% growth in checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 17%. Card purchase sales grew year over year in both portfolios, and in branded cards, accounts also continued to grow, up 3% from last year.","Slide 13 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve in the second quarter, with declining net credit losses and delinquencies.","And, in our international portfolios, we also saw stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis. In Asia, the NCL improvement in the second quarter reflects higher recoveries, but even excluding this benefit, the rate would have remained under 1%, with 90-plus day delinquencies stable at under 50 basis points.","In EMEA, we saw a net credit recovery in the second quarter while delinquencies continued to improve. And, in Latin America, the NCL rate improved to roughly 4%, while delinquencies were fairly stable. We currently expect the NCL rate in Latin America to remain in the range of 4% for the remainder of 2013.","However, the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to home builders in Mexico, which are included in commercial market loans. Our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled roughly $300 million at the end of the second quarter, with nearly 100% collateralized.","While we currently believe that we are adequately reserved for any potential losses related to the home building industry in Mexico, we continue to monitor the performance of our clients as well as the value of our collateral.","Slide 14 shows our consumer loans by major country. Roughly 80% of our loans are in six markets: North America, which is roughly half of our portfolio, followed by Mexico, Korea, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong.","While in certain markets, including North America, Korea, and Australia, loan growth has been hampered by the economic or regulatory environment, in other countries we continue to expand, reflecting the quality of our franchise and the growing population of high-quality borrowers in these markets.","Importantly, we are growing our loans with a disciplined focus on credit quality. In Mexico, while the NCL rate ticked up at the end of 2012, reflecting portfolio seasoning, the loss rate of under 4% remains low on a historical basis, driven by more stringent underwriting criteria and the repositioning of our cards portfolio over the past five years. And, in Singapore and Hong Kong, we have consistently maintained our focus on higher quality borrowers, resulting in low delinquency and loss rates.","Slide 15 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $6.4 billion grew 21% from last year, and declined 12% from the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $1 billion were up 21% from the prior year, with higher revenues in all major products, and declined 2% sequentially, driven by lower debt underwriting activity.","Overall, investment banking wallet share continued to improve in the first half of the year. Equity market revenues of $942 million were up 68% from last year, reflecting improved derivatives performance as well as higher cash equity volumes. Sequentially, equity market revenues increased 14%, driven by derivatives.","Fixed income market revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from last year, with strength across all major products, and were down 27% sequentially from a strong first quarter. Private bank revenues of $645 million grew 9% from last year, with growth across all regions, primarily driven by investment products, and were up 3% sequentially, driven by North America and EMEA.","Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $401 million in the second quarter, down 3% from last year on lower volumes, partially offset by slightly higher spreads. Lending revenues were up 21% sequentially, due mostly to the absence of losses on loan sale activity in the first quarter, and slightly higher spreads.","Total operating expenses of $3.5 billion were down 2%, both year over year and sequentially, reflecting the impact of repositioning versus the prior year, and lower compensation versus last quarter. Earnings before tax of $3 billion grew 80% from last year, and declined 19% sequentially.","Moving to transaction services on slide 16, revenues of $2.7 billion were down 1% from last year. Treasury and trade solutions were down 3%, as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues grew 5%, as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.","Spread compression continued to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume drivers for transaction services showed sustained momentum. Average trade loans grew 16% year over year. Average deposits were up 7%. Assets under custody grew by 10%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 13%.","Expenses of $1.4 billion grew 2% year over year, driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency savings. While spread compression is likely to impact revenues in the near term, we continue to believe we can achieve revenue growth and a return to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2013.","Slide 17 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were down versus the prior year, driven by hedging activities, while expenses of $525 million declined as well on lower legal and related expenses.","Assets of $290 billion included approximately $95 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $141 billion of liquid available for sale securities.","Slide 18 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $131 billion in Citi Holdings, or roughly 7% of total Citigroup assets. The $18 billion reduction in the second quarter reflected $8 billion of assets related to the sale of our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV, $4 billion of other asset sales, and $6 billion of net paydowns.","On slide 19, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.1 billion were up 17% year over year, as lower funding costs drove higher revenues in both the special asset pool and local consumer lending, despite the continued decline in loan balances. And we also saw improved asset marks in the special asset pool.","Citi Holdings expenses increased 25% year over year, to $1.5 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs in the special asset pool. Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 18% year over year, to roughly $845 million. Credit costs declined 63% year over year to $451 million. Net credit losses declined significantly to $770 million, and the net loan loss reserve release was over $470 million, including a release of roughly $525 million related to North America mortgages.","Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 20, rep and warranty reserve bills and legal and related costs continued to weigh on Citi Holdings in the second quarter. Excluding these items, Citi Holdings was breakeven on a pretax basis. The earnings improvement over the past two quarters has been driven by credit, as net credit losses continued to decline and we began utilizing our mortgage loan loss reserves.","North America mortgage NCLs declined to $553 million in the second quarter, roughly 95% of which were charged to the reserve. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 35 months of coverage.","Going forward, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we currently expect to continue to utilize reserves to offset nearly all of our mortgage net credit losses. Legal costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term.","However, we put a significant piece of our rep and warranty issues behind us with the recent Fannie Mae agreement, which covers substantially all potential future repurchase claims from Fannie Mae on loan originations from 2000 through 2012. While we continue to work through our remaining rep and warranty issues, we believe we are currently well-reserved for potential whole loan claims.","On slide 21, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the second quarter of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 31%, driven by $17 billion of paydowns, $11 billion of asset sales, and $9 billion of net losses.","In the second quarter of 2013, we sold $3.1 billion of loans, including $700 million of delinquent mortgages and $2.4 billion of current reperforming loans. We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 49% since the second quarter of 2011, to $553 million.","On slide 22, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. 30-plus day delinquencies improved by 10% sequentially to $5.5 billion, with improvement in each bucket across both portfolios.","On slide 23, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends, which, as a reminder, include the impact of moving our Credicard business to discontinued operations. Net interest revenue of $11.7 billion in the second quarter grew 3% year over year, and was up slightly from last quarter.","As we discussed at the end of the first quarter, our net interest margin in the second quarter decreased by 3 basis points, to 285 basis points. This decline was driven by lower loan and investment yields, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs.","Looking to the second half of 2013, we expect our net interest margin to stay roughly flat to perhaps a few basis points lower than the second quarter, so on a full year basis, we expect to be slightly above the net interest margin of 282 basis points we achieved last year.","On slide 24, we show our key capital metrics through the second quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 10% versus 9.3% last quarter, driven by retained earnings, DTA utilization, and the sale of our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, partially offset by losses on available for sale securities in OCI.","Turning to the leverage ratio, Citigroup\u2019s supplementary leverage ratio, as calculated using the U.S. Basel III NPR, was an estimated 4.9% for the second quarter. Unlike the tier one common ratio, which is a period-end calculation, the supplementary leverage ratio is the average of the three month end ratios calculated in the quarter.","While our average for the three months was 4.9% for the second quarter, this leverage ratio improved sequentially during the period, with an exit rate of just above 5% for the month of June. We are still reviewing the final U.S. Basel III rules, but do not believe the final rules will have a significant impact on the estimated ratios.","Our supplementary leverage ratio estimate does not incorporate differences in the definition of leveraged assets as recently proposed by the international Basel committee. As you are all aware, there has been quite a bit of activity and pronouncements relating to the capital requirements of large financial institutions over the past several weeks, and so our estimates are necessarily subject to our continued review and understanding of these recent developments.","In summary, our results for the second quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment, with spread compression, slowing global growth, and elevated legal and related costs remaining as headwinds. However, even with these challenges, we continued to grow our core business while significantly reducing the earnings drag from Citi Holdings.","In securities and banking, we had a strong second quarter, even as market conditions became more volatile late in the quarter. In transaction services, we continued to grow loan and deposit volumes to mostly offset the impact of global spread compression. And, in consumer banking, we also grew our loans in many markets year over year, overcoming spread compression to generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region outside North America.","In North America consumer, the environment remains challenging, with a combination of spread compression, consumer deleveraging, and a slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity expected to continue to put pressure on revenues for the remainder of the year.","In the mortgage business, we are beginning to take actions to reduce our expense base with the decline in activity, but we would expect there to be some lag as we continue to fulfill our backlog through the third quarter. We may face additional pressure, if not only volumes but also margins decline further, as we look to the back half of the year.","Turning to Citi Holdings, assets are now roughly 7% of total Citigroup, and the net loss was less than $600 million this quarter, even as we continued to face elevated legacy costs. While legal and related costs are expected to remain elevated in Citi Holdings in the near term, we put a significant piece of our rep and warranty issues behind us with the recently announced Fannie Mae agreement. And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of $380 billion and an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10% at quarter end.","Finally, we remain on track to achieve the expense savings from our fourth quarter repositioning actions, even as some of our year over year savings were offset by higher performance related compensation, given our strong revenues in the first half of the year.","And with that, Mike and I will be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","John, a question on expenses. I recall, in terms of the reposing savings, you were shooting for $900 million this year. In the first quarter you said you didn\u2019t get much of that. How much of that did you get in the second quarter? So where do we stand right now on realizing the $900 million you were shooting for this year?","John Gerspach ","You\u2019ve probably seen about $200 million of the repositioning savings reflected in the second quarter results.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And that $900, we should think of that as a year over year savings, \u201913 versus \u201912? Is that how we should look at it?","John Gerspach ","I guess the way I would think of it is if you go back to the fourth quarter, when we first talked about the $900 million and the whole repositioning action, I think we had core operating expenses in that quarter of about $11.5 billion. Now, since then we\u2019ve taken out Credicard. We\u2019ve moved that to discontinued operations, and we certainly had some impact of FX.","And so if you adjust for those two items, that would probably adjust out 11.5, to just a little bit north of 11.3. So the fourth quarter repositioning actions we\u2019ve said, you know, would yield full year saves of $1.2 billion, which means that $300 million of that save should be visible in our fourth quarter numbers.","So if you start with $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and you look at $300 million of saves that should be embedded in our fourth quarter numbers, you should expect a fourth quarter core operating expense number, you know, somewhere around $11 billion. Again, depending on how performance related IC could flow for the balance of the year.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And that was around $11.2 billion? The $11.173 billion this quarter? That\u2019s the right comparable number?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, for this quarter we\u2019re at $11.173 billion, and that includes the higher performance-related IC that we\u2019ve had this quarter. And I\u2019d say that we\u2019re on target to deliver the annual savings by the end of the year.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And in terms of the legal expenses remaining high, $800 million this quarter, it seems like you\u2019re on track to be similar to last year, when you did about $2.8 billion for the total. It\u2019s hard to predict that. Any color you could give us on the outlook there? Or just what\u2019s driving that to remain high? Is this kind of private label litigation stuff? Or any color you could offer there?","John Gerspach ","Certainly private label litigation is one of the legacy issues that we\u2019re dealing with. And you\u2019re quite right, we had $2.8 billion of legal and related expenses last year. We had $700 million or so in the first quarter of this year. So I would expect legal and related costs to, as we said, remain high and somewhat volatile.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And in terms of the DTA utilization, $1.3 billion for the first half, are we on a steady pace here? Can we think of $600 million to $700 million per quarter as a reasonably sustainable pace in this kind of environment? Or are there funny factors we need to think about that might drive this to be volatile over the next couple of quarters?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s actually going to depend upon the level and component pieces of our earnings stream. In looking at this quarter, Citicorp earnings actually utilized $1.3 billion of DTA. That would have been partially offset by $300 million of DTA that was created by holdings. Then you had CVA that actually utilized - because CVA was a revenue item this quarter - $200 million of DTA this quarter. And then OCI created DTA. So there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces that go into that $600 million.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","But the gradual trend of smaller drag in holdings is the key thing that will get this higher over time I guess?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say the two key things would be continued strong earnings out of Citicorp, and then the gradual decline, hopefully, in Citi Holdings losses, yes.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then final thing from me, in terms of that new supplemental leverage ratio, any thoughts on where you would look in terms of the bank level that will ultimately need to be into the 6% standard?","John Gerspach ","We did not have enough time to run the bank ratios for the second quarter. You know, as we mentioned, you\u2019ve got to run each month, and then the average of three months, and it\u2019s just a little bit more involved in running the bank. We had run the bank for the month of March, and at least as we ran the bank for the month of March, we were right around 6% for the month of March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","Just some question in terms of why we didn\u2019t see maybe more negative impact from the volatility in emerging markets, either within your capital or some of the fixed income businesses. I realize that\u2019s two different things, but just the volatility we saw in FX, and the spread widening, and [unintelligible] problems. It didn\u2019t really seem like it was all that material in the grand scheme of things.","John Gerspach ","As a matter of fact, I think we managed our emerging markets business quite well in the quarter. In the fixed income numbers, one of our real strong performers was our local markets FX business. That business, if I recall, generated revenue growth of 25% year over year, and 7% sequentially. So we actually performed quite well this quarter.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And then just somewhat related on the fixed income trading. Any meaningful impact from the OTC clearing of the swaps? Or do you think we\u2019ll have one going forward?","John Gerspach ","We still have to see how everything settles out. I still haven\u2019t seen the final guidance and everything that\u2019s coming out of all the debates from last week. And I think that\u2019s still something that is yet to be developed.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And you gave some net interest margin guidance. What about for net interest income dollars overall? Do you think we\u2019ll see them trend up from here?","John Gerspach ","That\u2019s a little bit difficult. If you look over the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve been relatively stable in our daily net interest revenue. I think our daily net interest revenue this quarter was $130 million a day. Last quarter it was $131 million a day. So it\u2019s going to be somewhat dependent on day count and a few other things. I really wouldn\u2019t want to go out on a limb and start predicting big increases in net interest revenue at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","A couple of questions on the capital ratios you indicated earlier. The bank sub level first half, 6% March, but the hold co, 4.9%. Can you just give us a sense as to what the big deltas are there? I just want to make sure the bank level six first pass is based on the proposed NPR not the final rule. Is that right?","John Gerspach ","You\u2019ve actually confused me with that question, Betsy. It\u2019s based upon the rules that we\u2019ve got outstanding right now.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And what makes the bank in such better position relative to the hold co?","John Gerspach ","It would be capital level and component of the balance sheet as far as how the leveraged assets are calculated.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, I was just thinking about it from the perspective of where your derivatives business is held. A portion of it in the bank, but a portion of it in the hold co. So I\u2019m just wondering if that has a disproportionate impact on the bank or not.","John Gerspach ","Everything has an impact. All we do I just run the rules. Don\u2019t forget the bank also has intercompany relationships in it. That\u2019s why the bank is a little bit more complicated to think through.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, I know you downstream some equity to the bank as well, and that helped, I would assume. Why just doing the ratios on the NPR as opposed to the final rule for the Basel ratio?","John Gerspach ","We\u2019re running them off of the U.S. final rule.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, I\u2019m just thinking there\u2019s the slide two, you had the note that all references to Basel III capital ratios are based on the proposed Basel III, the Basel III NPR?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s based upon the final rule as we best understand it right now. We have not finished going through every detail of the 900-plus pages in the final rule. So as we have looked at the final rule, we don\u2019t believe that for us there is any significant difference between the final rule and the NPR, because we haven\u2019t been able to find anything as yet.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, I just wanted to understand why you put that footnote in there. So two other quick things. One is on the [$50-60] million that you called out, which is obviously a pretty small number, and not really that material, especially on a quarterly basis. So I\u2019m just wondering what it is exactly, the regulatory assessment that you called out.","John Gerspach ","Well, the Fed last quarter actually, I believe they\u2019re allowed to do this under Dodd-Frank\u2026 Dodd-Frank permits the Fed to assess large banks with a special assessment for higher cost of regulation. And so the Fed put out, last quarter, an assessment proposal on all banks. I think that the total assessment was $440 million, and when we ran through the calculations for us, it comes out to be roughly $10 million a quarter.","Now, that was put out subject to a comment period, and all the comments are in, and we expect that the Fed will do something in the third quarter. And so we just thought it was prudent, then, to begin to accrue what we would estimate the impact of the fee to be. And since it\u2019s retroactive, all the way back to the beginning of 2012, for this quarter, then, we would have recorded six quarters of the estimated $10 million assessment.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then just lastly, on the litigation costs that you called out, you had, obviously, as you indicated, several settlements this quarter as well. So I\u2019m just wondering how much of the settlements were already reserved for, and how much of the litigation costs this quarter were to true up those settlements or how much is building reserve for future litigation?","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019ll see more detail when we publish the Q. And clearly if any of those settlements had involved significant charges in the quarter, we would have called that out.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","So you referred to the Basel proposal for add ons to the leverage ratio denominator, and I guess you were talking about the sold credit protection and match book and derivatives collateral disallowed. I think that\u2019s probably what you were referring to. Do you have any estimate for what the increase in your denominator would be in dollar terms for those things?","John Gerspach ","Again, all of this stuff has just come out, and so we did a very, very preliminary look at what the impact would be. And we would currently, roughly estimate that the combination of all those things could cost us as much as 40 basis points in the supplementary leverage ratio, but again, it\u2019s early, and we still have to take a look at exactly what the details are, and what else we might be able to do to offset some of that.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","On emerging markets, obviously what\u2019s happened over the last several months in some markets like China and Brazil would make you think that maybe we\u2019re looking at some weakness in macro growth. Any revisiting of the plans that you had talked about a few months ago to rationalize emerging markets investment in light of all that?","Mike Corbat ","The simple answer to that is no. You saw us, as we laid out, take some actions in the first quarter in terms of continuing to refine, in particular, parts of our consumer portfolio. But again, I think as we looked at the world and I think described coming into the year, what we saw was going to be a challenging, uneven environment. We obviously saw the numbers come out of China early this morning in terms of a slight slowdown, in the 7.5 versus the 7.6, a bit slower in Mexico. But I don\u2019t think those things have caused us to rethink where we are.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","The AOCI hit was obviously reasonably meaningful, in light of a pretty bad increase in long rates. And yet it seems like, looking at your AFS portfolio, it could have been worse. Did you take actions to reduce the impact by repositioning risk or something, sort of midquarter, ahead of the potential for rates to rise? Or was there something else there?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s just the way we manage the business on an ongoing basis. Nothing special.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And I guess the final question I\u2019ll ask is I think you alluded to trade finance growth, and looking at CTS, it looks like loans grew sequentially by about $13 billion, if I\u2019m reading this right. And that was about the same growth year over year as well as sequentially. So it basically all happened this quarter. Pretty sizable. Anything in particular going on in terms of market share initiatives or something that would have taken those loan balances up so fast?","John Gerspach ","One of the things we tried to footnote for you, and maybe we didn\u2019t get it on every schedule, but I tried to mention it in some of my comments, is that this quarter we also consolidated a previously off balance sheet vehicle that added about $7 billion of trade loans. This was a conduit that we had that housed really high quality government guaranteed export trade loans.","And just looking at the vehicle and the spread that we were getting, we felt that we could actually more efficiently fund the loans by bringing them back onto our balance sheet. So that $7 billion also got added in this quarter, and that\u2019s certainly impacting the number that you see.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","So all of that $7 billion went to CPS?","John Gerspach ","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","One on the mortgage NCLs. They came down 12% sequentially in Citi Holdings, which is great, but if we look at your peers, they were down much more than that. Is this just a function of you being more conservative on price assumptions? How should we think about the pace of recovery and loss rates in mortgage?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re more conservative in taking losses than anybody else. I think that what you\u2019re starting to see now is that as that legacy mortgage portfolio shrinks, and it\u2019s now down to $80 billion, what you have now is a bit more of an influence on the loss rates from the mortgage loans that we would have had as part of our Citi Finance business. And those mortgages carry a significantly higher loss rate than what the other mortgages would. And so I hate to use the word mix, but you\u2019re getting something of a mix impact on the NCL rate.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And you\u2019re suggesting those might be a little lag in terms of the recovery, because of the quality of them.","John Gerspach ","Those mortgages, they have an inherent larger loss rate. They didn\u2019t necessarily peak to the same extent, as high as some of the other aspects of the book, but they pretty much consistently run a loss rate of, say, 5%. So you\u2019ve got an element of our book that\u2019s running a 5% loss rate.","And that\u2019s also an element of our book that we\u2019re really not able to do much in the way of asset sales on. So those Citi Finance mortgages become an increasingly larger percentage of the overall $80 billion, and therefore they\u2019re going to be a somewhat mitigating factor as far as our ability to bring the overall loss rate for the portfolio down.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And then just maybe on the rate sensitivity, you guys, in your Q, talked about a steepening curve, maybe benefit of a little over $100 million, not very much. Versus your peers, that\u2019s on the low end. Is it a function of you being shorter in duration in your [AFS] book, and if you have that number that would be great, or is it just a factor of geographic mix on the balance sheet, that you\u2019re just less exposed to the U.S. rate curve?","John Gerspach ","I can\u2019t tell you how other people are positioned, but I think you\u2019re right, as focusing on that scenario [six] that we\u2019ve got in the 10-Q. But there\u2019s also a whole series of assumptions that go behind that analysis, including the assumption that in that type of environment, we would just match our investments and our funding book. In other words, the duration of the investment book would remain static. We wouldn\u2019t look to extend the duration of the book to capture yield, and I think you\u2019re right in assuming we are somewhat shorter duration, right now at least, than we would normally be.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Do you have that number? Or you don\u2019t disclose it?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019m not going to give you the overall duration, but it is fairly short.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","Thanks for the color on the emerging market book. I was just kind of curious if the trends that you saw in the 30-day delinquency rates were any different than the 90-day rates that you gave us?","John Gerspach ","In the consumer book, where we\u2019ve given you the detail? We\u2019ve actually got a lot of that back in the supplement. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything terribly telling as far as the 30-day delinquency statistics. You get some noise in some of the statistics. I think we talked in past calls about how the 30- to 90-day bucket in Latin America tends to move from quarter to quarter because we\u2019ve got a mortgage portfolio in there that actually we collect payments on every 60 days.","So you would have seen 30- to 90-day delinquencies in Latin America consumer spike up in the first quarter, and how you\u2019ve seen them drop in the second quarter. But outside of some individual portfolio quirks, there\u2019s nothing in the credit statistics in the early bucket delinquencies that gives us any extraordinary cause for concern.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","You also said that you had seen the slowing growth in emerging markets, but the revenues have hung in there. So should we continue to expect that revenue and credit would track roughly similar to what you\u2019ve recently seen this quarter? If we continue to see the slowing growth play out in emerging markets?","John Gerspach ","That\u2019s somewhat easier to talk about in the consumer businesses than it is in the institutional businesses. But on the consumer businesses, I think that\u2019s exactly the guidance that we were trying to provide you with in some of the closing commentary, where we feel that the consumer businesses in both Latin America and Asia should produce positive operating leverage in the second half of the year as we are able to grow revenues faster than growing expenses. On the institutional side, that\u2019s somewhat going to be dependent upon overall market conditions.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","And then in the equities business, another encouraging stat here this quarter. And I also noticed it seems as though, at least in the press, you guys recently hired someone out of PB. Is that a side of the business that you guys are looking to grow? What are your thoughts on the equities business at this point? Is it going to continue to be a focus to try to grow that further? Or are you guys happy with where it is now?","Mike Corbat ","I think what you saw is when we, over the past several years, we\u2019ve been going at the expense side of that business, trying to get it really in line with what we saw as future revenue opportunities. What you\u2019ve seen us also do is, while we\u2019ve shrunk our overall headcount and expense base, we\u2019ve also selectively made investments in terms of people and trading platforms in that business, and so early times. The results are improving. We\u2019re focused on continuing to want to take market share. We\u2019ve seen that. We\u2019ve seen good sequential growth quarter over quarter, but we\u2019ve got more work to do.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","You guys highlighted the decline in funding costs in holdings. Should we assume that decline is sustainable? And maybe could you give a little further color on what drove that decline?","Mike Corbat ","As the assets roll off, we obviously have a slightly higher cost net associated with those holdings assets. And so as those holdings assets roll off, the debt levels will reduce, and that should serve, then, to provide a funding cost benefit to that business. But really is more in line with the assets continuing to come down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You\u2019re doing quite well on your Basel tier one common ratio. It\u2019s 10% now. Where do you think you\u2019re going to manage to when you know all the ins and outs of what\u2019s required, which may take another 12 months. But what do you think you\u2019ll ultimately manage to on that ratio, as well as the new supplemental leverage ratio?","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019ve touched on the challenges, but I don\u2019t think we know yet all the ins and outs, and as we\u2019ve spoken about in the past, we don\u2019t really know yet around the rules what really buffer in either metric we need to run the institution to. So one of our objectives we\u2019ve stated is to, within reason, try and get to at or around these leverage ratios within a reasonable time. And as these rules continue to clarify themselves, we\u2019ll continue to adjust to that. But again, I think there\u2019s a lot more work we\u2019ve got to do to see how these things finalize themselves and what that buffer is.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","And I may have missed this. Did you give us the LCR ratio for this quarter?","John Gerspach ","No, I didn\u2019t, but would you care to ask about it?","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Sure. Just tell me what it is, please.","John Gerspach ","I mentioned the fact that we had over $380 billion worth of high-quality liquid assets, and at least the early estimate of the LCR ratio says that it\u2019s coming in exactly where we targeted it at, which is, as we said last quarter, right around 110%.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Could you also share with us, you mentioned Mexico, the three largest builders. Are those still accruing loans? Or are any of them in default? And then just some color on what you\u2019re seeing down in Mexico right now?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t know the answer to your first question. So I\u2019m going to have to ask you to call Susan or somebody in IR and by the time that happens, they\u2019ll figure out the answer to your first question. They are 100% collateralized, those loans. Nearly 100% collateralized.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And just color in general? Because Mexico has been so strong. And now this housing situation seems kind of odd considering the economy down there is pretty good.","John Gerspach ","I think what you have there is just market forces at work. Supply and demand, and as usual, with real estate, the most important consideration is location, location, location. And some of the home builders got a little over extended in putting supply where people don\u2019t necessarily want to live anymore.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then just finally, in Citi Holdings, the decline in the SAP assets to $14.9 billion from $18.5 billion, were there any bulk sales? Because you had some impressive declines in some of the categories.","John Gerspach ","I can\u2019t recall any large bulk sales off the top of my head. Again, it\u2019s just continuing to chip away at everything that is in holdings.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And has pricing for these assets improved, or does it continue to improve, from what you\u2019ve seen in the last six months?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say in general the pricing has held up. Obviously with mortgages now, given the change in the 10-year rate, that certainly has had an impact on the pricing that we see for reperforming loans. We mentioned the fact that we did about $3 billion of loan sales this quarter, and roughly $2.4 billion was reperforming loans. Those types of loan sales are more sensitive to changes in interest rates, because they\u2019re very yield-sensitive. And so that clearly is in a portion of the market that we\u2019ve seen prices decline in. In contrast, nonperforming mortgage loans seem to be more sensitive to changes in HPI. So pricing there has held up pretty well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","What\u2019s the capital markets backlog at the end of the quarter compared to the end of last quarter?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t have that, Mike. Sorry.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","You made the comment that you expect to use reserves in Citi Holdings to offset nearly all of the mortgage losses. If you could elaborate on what that means. And does that mean, if I look at slide 20, the bottom right hand corner, where you have adjusted pretax earnings for Citi Holdings, that\u2019s zero this quarter. Does that statement that you\u2019ll use those reserves to offset mortgage losses imply that that adjusted pretax earnings figure of zero in the second quarter of 2013 should stay at zero or go higher? Or you aren\u2019t willing to make a statement that this is an inflection point?","John Gerspach ","I think it\u2019s a little early to make a prediction as far as an inflection point. And a statement as far as using the reserves, it\u2019s really nothing more than basically continuing to do what we\u2019ve done here in the second quarter, where we\u2019ve used reserves to cover basically 95% of the mortgage NCLs. Don\u2019t forget that the holdings portfolio is pretty much a closed book, right? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re adding new loans into that portfolio. And that\u2019s a little different than you would think about in a normal mortgage business.","So we\u2019ve established reserves for what we believe to be the losses that are inherent in that portfolio, based upon the way that the markets are moving, and the way that we would look at our need for reserves right now. We felt this quarter, and we think that certainly in the next two quarters - you can look out about six months - we don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using the reserves that we\u2019ve already established to almost fully cover the losses that we set them up to cover.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","What about blowing out some more of the problem mortgages from Citi Holdings? You said that\u2019s more a function of home prices, so why not get more aggressive with sales?","John Gerspach ","Well, again, you\u2019ve got two different components to the book. From a nonperforming loan point of view, you\u2019re quite right. Those nonperforming loans are very price sensitive to HPI. And we were able to do about $700 million of nonperforming loan sales this quarter.","But we\u2019ve been doing nonperforming loan sales, go back to the last 15 quarters. And so our nonperforming loan book is fairly well picked over at this point in time. And with delinquencies performing the way they are, we\u2019re not necessarily creating a bunch of new inventory, which we think is good.","The other side of the book, as we continue to modify loans, and those loans then perform, that gives us a different set of inventory to deal with. And you\u2019ve noticed that, in the last two quarters, we\u2019ve actually taken advantage of that. We sold $2.4 billion of reperforming loans this quarter, and a similar number last quarter.","The trouble with reperforming loans is that the pricing on those loans is really yield sensitive. And so now with interest rates spiking the way they are, the pricing is not quite as favorable in that market at this point in time.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And a completely separate question, going back to your March 5 presentation, slide 12, you had a couple of categories: optimize and grow, and optimize restructure. So I was wondering, with the benefit of a few more months to evaluate the franchise, if there\u2019s any incremental information on that.","And then also as you said on the call, you expect to have your $1.2 billion run rate expense savings going into 2014. What\u2019s after that? So really, what\u2019s next for expenses and restructuring, and what else have you learned in the past few months?","Mike Corbat ","Well, I think as we laid out in March, what we said is that those slides are going to continue to evolve, our four buckets. And so we have, as part of the restructuring, and as part of the things that we\u2019ve announced as normal course of business, in terms of refinements of our institutional clients and our consumer strategies, continued to work against that.","I think importantly, as John spoke about from a repositioning charge perspective, we\u2019re not planning, signaling, talking about some big repositioning, but want to continue to push our businesses to work and optimize over time. And so I think what you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, and it is just the first half of the year, from an efficiency ratio perspective, we\u2019re making progress, and we\u2019re pushing our leaders and managers around the concept of thinking about and running their businesses that way.","So there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve got planned that\u2019s a big monumental move in terms of an overall restructuring or change of direction at the company, just a focus on being in a challenging operating environment, and making sure we\u2019re managing ourselves in the appropriate way.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And I think before you said the optimized restructure bucket might be about 10% of the firm, is that correct? And has that changed? And any more color on what that bucket might include?","Mike Corbat ","I don\u2019t have that slide in front of me. That number actually sounds a bit low to me as you describe it, at that percentage. No, again, I think this work continues to evolve, and I would say at this point, nothing new to report. And as we get to year end or into the fourth quarter, and go through budgets, we\u2019ll be continuing to assess how we\u2019re thinking about our products and our countries, and we\u2019ll continue to align and realign those buckets accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","My first question is assuming the change in leverage ratio rules stays, does that impact any of your major significant businesses? I mean, do you have to run them differently? I\u2019m thinking custody and transaction processing, maybe government bond dealing. Anything that\u2019s heavy in leveraged assets, but not RWAs. Are there any businesses that you\u2019re going to have to run differently?","John Gerspach ","All good questions, and all way too early in the process to really address. Certainly what we\u2019ve seen so far are proposals. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually had a chance to read through every aspect of it, and I would expect that as usual, we\u2019ll engage in a robust and healthy dialogue, constructive dialogue, with the various regulators on these topics.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","And then secondly, just to follow up on the questions about emerging markets, a lot of the damage to the whole commodities complex, all that has happened very, very recently, in the second half of May and June. And just I was wondering if Mike\u2019s comments earlier, should we read that if commodity prices roughly stay at this level, that we should not expect any significant fallout in terms of your businesses in the emerging markets?","Mike Corbat ","I think, again, as John described, there\u2019s two components to our business. One is the consumer piece, and we\u2019ve signaled how we think about the second half of the year there. I think it\u2019s difficult right now to be able to judge where we are in terms of a trading environment. June was certainly choppier than the first four or five months of the year. And it\u2019s hard to predict what the trading environment is going to be like in the second half.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","I didn\u2019t mean so much the trading environment. I meant gold and all other commodities that you can look at, basically, have come down pretty significantly in May and June. And does that significantly impact the economies you\u2019re working in?","Mike Corbat ","I think that\u2019s exactly what we have to see. It\u2019s not so much the commodity price in and of itself. It\u2019s what\u2019s the ongoing impact on the economies. And as we\u2019ve said before, we still anticipate that the emerging market economies are going to grow at a much faster rate than the developed economies. And so we would still expect to get more growth out of the emerging markets in general than the developed markets. And we continue to run our business in each of those geographies with a very disciplined focus on credit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just a quick follow up question. I appreciate the guidance on NCLs for [GCB] Latin America. Should we expect the same stability in dollar provision or should we continue to increase it as we\u2019ve seen over the past two quarters?","John Gerspach ","That\u2019s a good question. I would say that when we say that the rates should stabilize, you would likely see some small increments in the NCL nominal dollars themselves. Again, subject to currency fluctuations.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","So the dollar NCLs are going up, but the dollar provision will go up in tune with growth and the dollar increase in NCLs?","John Gerspach ","On a constant dollar basis, with growing portfolios and a stable NCL rate, you would expect the nominal dollar NCL to increase slightly, right along with the growth in the portfolios. As those portfolios grow, it\u2019s likely, then, that we would have to provide some level of additional loan loss reserve against those portfolios.","Erika Penala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And just one more question, for a different topic. Mike, could you update us on what your thoughts are in terms of potentially doing large card transactions in the U.S., and what are the top parameters you\u2019re considering, whether thinking about even putting a bid in, or formulating a bid in, if a large card transaction were to become available?","Mike Corbat ","A couple of things we can speak about. One is you saw us in the first quarter announce our Best Buy transaction, roughly a $7 billion card portfolio that we thought fit in well against our retail partner services business.","And so in that business, we would continue to look at portfolios that we think fit in and have adjacencies, either from a sector or from a geography perspective, in there. Obviously we\u2019re going to be mindful of returns of capital, of absolute risk profiles that are there.","So things that make sense from that perspective, we\u2019re happy to consider. And I think in the branded space, there\u2019s probably less opportunities to acquire portfolios in that segment of the market, in the areas where we are.","But again, if those presented themselves, and economically they made sense, and they were the right client set that fit against our targeted set of clients, and they were the right risk profile, we\u2019d certainly consider them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW.","Fred Cannon - KBW ","I just had a couple of follow up questions on the DTA. I was wondering about the reduction in the DTA in this quarter, if you were able to reduce the foreign tax credit carry-forward portion of the DTA as a result of that reduction.","John Gerspach ","Great question. Addressing the component pieces of the DTA as far as how much of it relates to foreign tax credit and everything else, that\u2019s something that you can really only answer as you close out the year and you finalize your overall tax provision. So trying to provide detailed guidance as far as how much of the $1.3 billion of DTA that we\u2019ve utilized in the first half of the year, how much of that comes off of [FPCs]. I just can\u2019t reliably do that at this point in time.","Fred Cannon - KBW ","That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the K, not the Q, I imagine. Also, in terms of the Best Buy card deal, any update on the timing of the closing of that? And also, is there any way we can estimate how much positive impact that would have on the DTA once it does close?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s a little hard to isolate a specific portfolio, but as far as I know, we\u2019re still on track to close that deal in September. So we won\u2019t get much benefit, if any, in the third quarter out of that portfolio, but it\u2019s a $7 billion portfolio then. We should get a fourth quarter benefit from it in the fourth quarter.","Fred Cannon - KBW ","And then the tax rate taken against that. I know it\u2019s hard to isolate, but just from our standpoint, the tax rate taken against that should help directly reduce the DTA?","John Gerspach ","All things being equal, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","John, you mentioned transaction services, you expect operating leverage gains in the second half. Just specifically, is that expected in fourth quarter? Or are you suggesting that that could be the case for the full second half results within TS?","John Gerspach ","Just want to make sure, that was for transaction services. I wasn\u2019t being specific to a part of TTS. That was really expansive for all TTS. And I actually think that you might be able to see some positive operating leverage as early as the third quarter.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then you mentioned that there were still some regulatory headwinds in the Asian business. I guess you mentioned in the past some of the regulatory challenges that you\u2019ve faced in Korea. I guess I\u2019m curious, maybe to get a sense as to how far along on that path, specific to Korea, you think you are, since it sounds like you\u2019re expecting somewhat better operating leverage trends within the Asian business overall.","John Gerspach ","I would say that Korea is still going through some issues. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to be completely out of the regulatory headwinds in Korea, in other words, have completely worked through the repositioning of the book, until sometime next year, maybe even to the end of next year. So that\u2019s going to continue to be a drag on us.","That\u2019s why when we look at Asia, Korea certainly is a weight on us, but Asia overall, we still have some good loan growth. And if you look in the back of the presentation material that we gave you, on slide 33, if you take a look at Asia, excluding Korea and Japan, year on year we\u2019re getting 10% loan growth coming out of Asia. So Korea\u2019s an anchor, but it\u2019s not the only thing that is propelling our business forward.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just finally, back home, any thoughts as to a potential settlement with Freddie? I know that Fannie was a bigger buyer of your mortgages over time, but any thoughts about potentially settling with the other side of the GSEs?","Mike Corbat ","What I would say is we won\u2019t comment on Freddie specifically, other than to just reaffirm that we\u2019re continuing to work through these things and get them behind us as a top priority.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton ","A couple of numbers questions and then a policy question. Can you update us on what the Basel III risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings are?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t have that number off the top of my head. But if you get ahold of IR, they\u2019ll be able to supply you with that. But I believe that it\u2019s now down to 21% of our total risk-weighted assets, but I don\u2019t have the math of that in my head.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton ","And then in the reconciliation on page 43, where you list deductions from Basel III tier one as $45 billion for DTAs and other items. Is it fair to assume that most of that $45.3 billion is DTAs of one sort or another at this point?","John Gerspach ","Yes.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton ","And then finally, you talked about being engaged with regulators on the leverage proposal. Could you be more specific about that? Are you actually going to object to either the percentage or the way the denominator is calculated, for example?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t want to specify where we might object or anything like that, because when you look at what you\u2019re dealing with, risk-weighted assets, leveraged assets, liquidity rules, each one of these broad concepts is valid in its own right, and serves a purpose in ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system. In almost every case, it\u2019s really a matter of degree and how well the various elements work together. And I think those are areas worth of discussion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","First, in terms of the runoff portfolio in North American mortgages, can you help us think about the pace of the runoff going forward? What\u2019s the appetite been like recently? You\u2019ve talked about that in the past. Any change in terms of, given the macro backdrop, potentially shifting again?","John Gerspach ","Well, as you\u2019ve seen, over the course of the last two quarters, we\u2019ve been able to sell about $6 billion of those mortgage loans. Roughly, a little bit shy of $3 billion in the first quarter and then $3.1 billion or so in the second quarter, as we took advantage of some favorable market conditions. A large portion of what we were able to sell in the first half of the year were these reperforming loans that I talked about earlier.","And the pricing on those loans is really sensitive to yield. And so with the recent rise in interest rates, the market has changed for those reperforming loans. And so I\u2019ll have to reassess to see whether or not we can continue the pace of sale that we\u2019ve got for those types of assets.","Mike Corbat ","And I think as part of that, as we\u2019ve said historically, the focuses are a couple of things. One is that we want to obviously continue to reduce the size and drag of the portfolio, but that drag comes from a couple of perspectives. It not only comes from the cost of credit, it comes from the operating expenses associated with the portfolio.","And when we can go in particular at the delinquent part of the portfolio, and continue to sell that part of the mix down, it allows us to go back and get out a lot of high costs. And so we\u2019re focused in the aggregate, derisking, getting smaller, reducing the drag, and so as the market affords opportunities, we\u2019re going to continue to try and take advantage of them.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And in terms of accelerating the pace of that, you previously talked about that the buyer liquidity has been a hurdle, just given the size of the portfolio that you need to reduce. But then also you\u2019ve brought up how there\u2019s been a difference in lifetime loss estimates more recently. Can you expand on that point a little bit more in terms of what you mean, in terms of maybe just the buyer-seller perspective?","Mike Corbat ","Historically, when we\u2019ve looked at or thought about some different larger, in particular bulk sales, there\u2019s at least three components that go into the pricing that comes in. One is what\u2019s the buyer\u2019s cost of money? Second is what are their expectations around loss rates? And the third is, you know, what\u2019s the capital they need to hold against it, and what\u2019s the cost of capital?","I would say in most every instance, when we see that from a bulk perspective, the numbers or the math associated with each of those three things, from our perspective, makes it a sale that\u2019s not worthwhile. So, again, we pretty simply look at our own view towards those three things, and if somebody\u2019s willing to pay us what we think the value of those assets, or of those securities are, we\u2019re happy to sell them.","Today, in bulk form, we haven\u2019t seen that. If and when that opportunity presents itself, we\u2019d love to act on it. But we haven\u2019t seen that to date, and we\u2019re not running the portfolio with the belief that in the near term that\u2019s going to be out there.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then separately, you had mentioned the LCR currently at about 110. Is that comparable to last quarter? If I have it correctly, 116?","John Gerspach ","Yes, that\u2019s perfectly comparable.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And did I understand also that 110 is about the right level that you feel comfortable running at in terms of a buffer on top of the current minimums?","John Gerspach ","That is the target that we established last quarter.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then just lastly, kind of just stepping back. Can you help just frame out, in terms of your near term, long term, medium term goals of 10% ROE and ninety-one ten ROA, how the recent kind of global slowdown that you mentioned, as well as the U.S. mortgage market, may be shifting here? How much does that affect, if that all, those goals?","Mike Corbat ","We\u2019re not changing those goals. We said that those goals were constructed in what we believed to be a slower growth, challenging environment. We said that we would hope to be able to achieve those goals, and we hadn\u2019t built in interest rate rises into those pieces. And I think that as global growth presents a headwind, or the market presents a headwind, we\u2019ve got to take those in stride within the numbers that we\u2019ve put out there.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","Susan Kendall","Thank you all for joining us here today.

Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.","Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K. ","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 or $1.61 per share. Our net income for the year totaled $18 billion or $6.65 per share, a 25% increase from 2017. ","During 2018, we made solid progress towards the 2020 targets as we\u2019d committed. Our return on tangible common equity reached 10.9%, exceeding the 10.5% we targeted for the year. And despite the market conditions we experienced throughout the fourth quarter, we still improved our operating efficiency to 57% for the year.","In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7% respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast. We had positive operating leverage and our EBIT was up 5% on an underlying basis. ","While the revenue environment was more challenging than we had anticipated, we responded decisively by managing both our expenses and our balance sheet in light of the lower market sensitive revenues. Our expense base declined by 4% both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter, taking our annual expense base to below $42 billion, and we continued to prudently manage risk-weighted assets to optimize our capital needs. ","While we won't sacrifice the investments which are key to competing in the future, we also have to ensure that we remain flexible and adapt to whatever market conditions and economic conditions that materialize. ","Turning to the quarter, in the Institutional Clients Group, our market-sensitive products generally had a challenging quarter, especially in fixed income. We did gain share in M&A, but Investment Banking was impacted by a decline in equity and debt originations during the quarter. Our accrual businesses, which consist of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, the Private Bank, and Corporate Lending continued their very strong performance, up 11% for the full year in constant dollars. And as a matter of fact, we've now had five straight years of consecutive growth in TTS and are confident that we can continue with that momentum. ","In Global Consumer Banking, in the US, we saw 4% underlying growth in Branded Cards and 6% revenue growth in Retail Services this quarter, and Retail Banking grew 5% ex-mortgages. Internationally, we saw good growth in Mexico, especially in the cards products, while Asia was impacted by lower revenues from investment products. ","During the year, we returned $18.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, buybacks of common stock reduced the shares outstanding by over 200 million shares from a year ago or 8%, and our tangible book value per share increased by 6%. We finished the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, up from 11.7% in the third quarter as risk-weighted assets declined. We'll be making our CCAR submission in the spring and believe we've got the capacity to reach our three-year capital return target of $60 billion. ","As 2019 begins, we find ourselves operating in a more uncertain macro environment. From what we see, economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate. That said, we're prepared to make adjustments if we get the sense economic conditions are changing. ","We remain committed to our 2020 financial targets. And this year, we've targeted increasing our return on tangible common equity to 12% and further improving our efficiency ratio. ","We continue to utilize technology to improve the client experience and lower our cost to serve, whether it's by automating processes or enhancing our mobile channels, and we'll continue to rollout new digital capabilities throughout the year. ","As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long-term so that we can serve our clients with distinction. ","One thing before we go to Q&A, I want to take a minute on the occasion of his final earnings call, to thank John for his 28 years of service to the firm and to congratulate him on his retirement. I know those on the phone respect him for his candor and honesty, and we'll miss him. He leaves things in good hands with Mark Mason and I know everybody's going to enjoy working with Mark. ","With that, John will go through our presentation and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach ","Hey. Thank you very much, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, first, let me note that all comparisons throughout this presentation exclude the one-time impact of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as a subsequent adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","As previously disclosed, we recorded a non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. At that time, we noted that the final impact of Tax Reform could differ from the provisional estimate based on the finalization of our own analysis as well as additional guidance to be received from the US Treasury Department. ","In the recent quarter, we finalized our analysis and adjusted the provisional charge resulting in a benefit to income taxes of nearly $100 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding this benefit, we earned a $1.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Now, looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction in expenses, lower cost of credit, and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. ","Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. ","Expenses declined by 4% or over $400 million year-over-year resulting in our 9th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit was down 7% versus last year. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting an adjustment to our full year estimate of income taxes under the new tax regime as well as other resulting actions we have taken. This results in an effective tax rate of just over 23% for full year 2018, which we believe to be an appropriate tax rate as we look into 2019. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $684 billion and deposits grew 7% to $1 trillion.","Now, looking at full year results on Slide 4, we made steady progress in 2018, although revenue growth remained somewhat below our medium-term outlook. As a reminder, in 2017, we recorded a one-time gain of roughly $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in ICG. And in 2018, we had a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico asset management business in Consumer. Excluding these items, Consumer revenues grew 3% in constant dollars, slightly below our medium-term goal. This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in US Branded Cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in US Retail, a drag from lower US Mortgage revenues which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity.","Institutional revenues also grew 3%, as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income, as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting.","These results largely reflect the macro uncertainty seen in the fourth quarter, which created a challenging trading environment as well as an industry-wide slowdown in underwriting activity. Despite these headwinds, we made continued progress on our efficiency goals, driving our full year efficiency ratio to 57%.","Credit quality remained broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pre-tax earnings grew 5%. EPS grew by 25% including the benefit of share buybacks as well as a lower effective tax rate. And our full year RoTCE is just under 11%, well above our target for 2018, which positions us well relative to our 12% goal for 2019.","Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. In total, revenues of $5.3 billion grew 1% in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 1% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continued to decline, mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. ","Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter, and deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio, and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity.","Average deposits declined 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the transfer of deposits into investments. Assets under management were flat year-over-year as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, given the equity market sell off at year-end. Excluding market movements, total deposits in assets under management grew 1% with improving momentum.","If you look at 2018 versus 2017, we more than doubled our net new money inflows across consumer deposits and investments this year. And we retained a larger dollar amount of those deposits that transferred into investments.","Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were roughly flat versus the prior year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio as well as partnership terms that went into effect in 2018. Excluding Hilton, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, including 7% growth in net interest revenue reflecting loan growth and spread improvement versus the prior year.","Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio.","This growth in [Technical Difficulty] improved by over 30 basis points to nearly 880 basis points, a little better than we had anticipated for the fourth quarter. We\u2019re now approaching a more optimal mix of interest earning and non-interest earning balances. ","As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time. This should fuel strong underlying revenue growth in 2019 and beyond. As we\u2019ve now lapped the impact of partnership renewals on our fee income and we\u2019re growing loan volumes at more attractive spreads. We continue to expect reported growth in total revenues in 2019, even considering the Hilton and Visa B gains we took in 2018. ","Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 6%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the benefit of the acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 3%, primarily reflecting investments.","Turning to credit, total credit costs were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and portfolio seasoning in both Branded Cards and Retail Services. Our NCL rate in US Branded Cards was 297 basis points for full year 2018, exactly in line with our 3% outlook. And in Retail Services, our NCL rate was 488 basis points for the full year, which is again consistent with our 5% outlook in that segment.","On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 1%, driven by Latin America. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter. Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6% excluding the impact of the asset management sale. ","Retail loan growth was vivid in Mexico this quarter, driven by an episodic paydown in our commercial portfolio, while we continued to generate solid growth in deposits. ","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business in the prior year. Excluding the gain, card revenues grew 3% year-over-year on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. And Retail Banking revenues declined 1%, reflecting the lower investment revenues.","While investment revenues remained under pressure, we continued to see positive inflows into assets under management as well as 8% growth in Citigold Client. And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia Consumer growth remained broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits. ","Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower return mortgage assets. Excluding mortgages, loans grew 5% year-over-year.","In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth was largely offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit declined 1%, reflecting a modest reserve release in Latin America this quarter. ","Slide 7 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter across regions. In North America, the sequential uptick in delinquencies is consistent its seasonal trends we\u2019ve seen in other years in the third quarter to the fourth quarter driven by cards. This typical translates then into higher NCL rates in the first half relative to the second half of the year. ","Turning now the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and Equity Markets were more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income. Total banking revenues of $5 billion grew 5%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads. ","Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity. ","Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads and Corporate Lending revenues of $559 million were up 9%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs. ","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.1 billion declined 11% in the fourth quarter. Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year-over-year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter. ","At the Goldman Conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter in G10 rates in particular, as clients had largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment. Thereafter, the environment continued to deteriorate characterized by volatile market conditions and widening credit spreads. This resulted in a risk-off sentiment where the market-making became even more challenging in December across both rates and currencies, and spread products. ","Equities revenues were up 18%, mainly reflecting the impact of an episodic loss in the prior year. On an underlying basis, revenues were down slightly, as strong client activity, particularly in derivatives, was offset by a challenging trading environment and lower client financing balances. ","And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 7% as reported and 12% in constant dollars driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 2% year-over-year on lower compensation costs associated with lower revenues. ","And finally, cost of credit was $129 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio. ","Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018. We generated over half of our revenues in banking, which grew 5% on continued momentum in TTS, the Private Bank and Corporate Lending. Securities Services grew 11%, as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment. And in equities, we made solid progress with revenues up 19% for the full year. ","The combined strong performance in these businesses helped to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6% respectively on a full year basis. But even within these businesses there were still some standouts. In Investment Banking, we showed continued progress in M&A with revenues up 16%. And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network. ","Cost of credit was higher than the prior year given lower reserve releases but credit quality remained solid with roughly 5 basis points of losses for the year.","Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $470 million declined 37% from last year driven primarily by the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 45%, also reflecting the wind-down, as well as lower infrastructure costs. And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations. ","Looking ahead, we would still expect a modest pre-tax quarterly loss in Corporate\/Other in 2019. ","Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margins trends. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter grew roughly 8% from last year in constant dollars as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. ","Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year-over-year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our US Branded Cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets. ","On a sequential basis, our core accrual net interest margin improved by 12 basis points to 372 basis points, including 4 basis points from the FDIC surcharge benefit. The remaining 8 basis points reflect momentum we\u2019ve seen building over the second half of the year, given higher interest rates, continued loan growth and an improved loan mix. ","As we noted last quarter, even though core accrual net interest revenues grew sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2018, our net interest margin remained flat at 360 basis points as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter. ","As we deployed that liquidity into better yielding assets, you can now see that underlying revenue improvement pull-through in the net interest margin. On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by more than $4 billion over 2017, ahead of our outlook of $3.7 billion for the year with about $1 billion coming from the benefit of higher interest rates.","As we had expected, this was partially offset by a nearly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind-down portfolio in Corporate\/Other. And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year, similar to the year-over-year decline seen in 2017. ","So, if you look at our total net interest revenue for full year 2018, we grew by about $2 billion year-over-year in constant dollars.","As we look at net increase revenue for 2019, now, we're unlikely to get the same magnitude of benefit from rate hikes this year. However, a slowing rate trajectory should also translate into a smaller drag from trading-related net interest revenue from 2018 to 2019. ","We should also see a smaller drag from the wind-down of legacy assets. And then, of course, we will benefit from the absence of the FDIC surcharge which is about a $400 million benefit year-over-year.","So, on a net basis, we expect to generate as much or even more than the $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue that we saw in 2018, even if we see less incremental benefit from rate hikes. Of course, in 2018, this growth in net interest revenue was partially offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in non-interest revenues, driven by a drag from partnership renewal terms and lower mortgage revenues in Consumer, the wind-down of legacy assets, the impact of gains we took in 2017 on hedging activity in Corporate Treasury and the net impact of previously mentioned one-time gains on asset sales. ","We do not expect non-interest revenues to decline again in 2019, as we've now lapped the operating revenue headwinds in Consumer and we expect less pressure from the wind-down of legacy assets.","On Slide 11 we show our key capital metrics. In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets, as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet.","Our total CET1 Capital declined modestly during the quarter, as net income and DTA utilization were more than offset by $5.8 billion of total share buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we returned over $18 billion of capital to common shareholders for a payout of 110% of net income to common. And based on our 2018 CCAR capital plan, we expect to return an additional $9.8 billion of capital in the first half of 2019.","In summary, we made continued progress in 2018. And while the revenue environment proved more challenging than we had anticipated, especially in the fourth quarter, we delivered on several key objectives. We improved our RoTCE by nearly 300 basis points, achieving a full year RoTCE of 10.9% and exceeding our goal of 10.5% for the year.","We delivered nearly a 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio, while continuing to invest in our future. ","We maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio, while maintaining loss rates that were well within our medium-term expectations across every business and region. ","We achieved the benefit to our ongoing effective tax rate under the new tax regime that exceeded our initial estimates. And we delivered on our capital optimization goals returning over $18 billion of capital through share buybacks and dividends during the year. ","We recognize that the bar gets even higher as we go into 2019. We also recognize that we\u2019re in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019re continuing to manage the franchise responsibly and we\u2019re committed to steady, sustainable improvement in both our efficiency and returns.","If you look at our performance in 2018, several businesses performed well with good visibility into 2019. The largest of these is our Treasury and Trade Solutions franchise, which generated over $9 billion of revenues and posted its 5th consecutive year of growth in constant dollars. ","Our other accrual businesses in ICG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019. ","Our Mexico Consumer franchise with nearly $6 billion of revenues continued to grow with a favorable market backdrop, including record low unemployment and strong consumer confidence. And while are US Branded Cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past three years.","We also made significant progress in bringing our US Consumer business together for a more powerful client-centric franchise as we go forward. And we took on new portfolios like the L.L.Bean card acquisition to augment our organic growth. Of course, it\u2019s more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equities this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market. ","As we look to 2019, we\u2019re preparing for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our RoTCE target of 12% this year in a responsible sustainable way. From a revenue perspective, in addition to the good momentum we\u2019re seeing in many of our businesses, we also have other revenue tailwinds, including the absence of the FDIC surcharge, as well as a smaller expected drag from the wind-down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other. ","In 2018, we absorbed over $1 billion of total revenue drag from legacy assets, which compressed top-line growth by about 1% and it should drop to about half that amount in 2019.","In addition, on the expense side, we\u2019re now beginning to see efficiency saving meaningfully outpace the incremental investments we\u2019ve continued to make in the franchise. ","In the second half of 2018, we realized a net benefit to expenses of roughly $200 million, as savings exceeded incremental investments. That should grow to around $500 million to $600 million of net incremental savings in 2019, plus an additional $500 million to $600 million of net incremental benefits in 2020. These net savings should offset volume-driven expenses as we continue to grow the business. And it should also result in positive operating leverage for Citi in total and for our consumer and institutional businesses in 2019. ","Of course, the magnitude of operating leverage we can achieve this year is sensitive to the revenue environment. But even if the environment is challenging, we believe we can deliver more total efficiency improvement than we did in 2018. And achieving our 12% RoTCE goal for this year is not dependent on capturing the full efficiency benefits we laid out in the fall which showed roughly a 175 basis points of improvements to our efficiency ratio in 2019. ","Credit continues to perform well. Our effective tax rate is coming in better than we had originally estimated under the new tax regime with the potential to move somewhat lower. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, the growth opportunities are limited. We will prudently manage the balance sheet to limit RWA growth, and therefore, our capital needs. ","It's still our goal to get the efficiency ratio into the low 50% range as we believe that\u2019s the right level given the investments we're making in digital and automation, as well as our mix of businesses. But our primary goal is to responsively and sustainably improve the return we're delivering on our shareholders' equity from the roughly 11% we achieved in 2018 to about 12% this year and over 13.5% in 2020. ","And with that, Mike, Mark and I are happy to take any and all questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we have a question from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. ","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. And John congrats on retirement. ","John Gerspach ","Hey. Thanks, Jim. ","Jim Mitchell","Maybe if I can follow-up on just -- still out of time there at the end on the expense flexibility. I think that's a big sort of concern in the marketplace given the revenue backdrop at least in the fourth quarter that can change quickly in capital markets and I appreciate the commitment to the RoTCE. But when we think about in a more dire scenario, how much kind of a flexibility do you have? You were down 4% year-over-year in a tougher environment, can you get expenses down year-over-year in 2019? How do we think about sort of that range of flexibility so we can kind of play around with our models?","Mark Mason","Hi, Jim. This is Mark Mason. How are you?","Jim Mitchell","Hi, Mark. How are you?","Mark Mason","Good. I\u2019ll turn you to Page 17 inside of the deck that John just read through. And what 17 shows, if you look back all the way to 2016, and it shows the long-term -- the trailing month efficiency ratios. And what we\u2019ve shown here is that year-over-year for the past number of quarters we've been able to bring that operating efficiency down. But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about 41.8. And if you look back at any of those years in 2017 and 2016, that's about the range in which we've run over the past couple years. And so to answer your question, I think as we think about the prospects for 2019 and our ability to manage expenses tightly, this is probably the range you should think about. ","Mark Mason","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one question on credit and cards. Are you still comfortable John or with the 3% in Branded Cards and 5% or is -- I know that was sort of your prior expectation, is that still the expectation in \u201819 for the card losses? ","John Gerspach ","What we\u2019ve said, the medium-term expectations would be that Branded Cards would operate in that range of 3% to 3.25% and Retail Services in the 5% to 5.25%. And those are still valid assumptions as we move forward and specifically for 2019. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. ","John McDonald ","Hi, good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could just clarify the range that you were referring to in your answer to Jim's question. You mentioned the 41.8 this quarter is a low on that slide. Was there a range from that to something else or just kind of this ballpark of 41, 42. Just wondering kind of what you\u2019re referring to there?","Mark Mason","Ballpark range, if you look at the Page 17, fourth quarter of \u201916, the LTM there was about 42.3, fourth quarter of \u201818 about 41.8. So that's a ballpark range roughly. ","John McDonald ","Okay, got it. And then two questions for you guys on the Branded Card. John you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front which was very solid this quarter and better fees as your lap the partnership headwind. So what's the reasonable revenue growth aspiration for 2019 in this kind of economy? Is it similar to how you exited here in that 2% to 3%? Is that kind of how you\u2019re thinking about Branded Card revenues for \u201819?","Mark Mason","I mean if you -- the Branded Cards as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying, and that's a -- we think of that as a pretty good run rate going into 2019. ","John McDonald ","Okay. And then you mentioned the card loss guidance just a question ago. Just wondering on the card ROA, I think the previous target for Branded Card was 215 basis points Branded Card ROA, and for the year you're at 180, in this quarter you're at 211. Is that 215 kind of the aspiration on the Branded Card ROA? I think that was prior to Tax Reform. We're just wondering what your updated thoughts are there? ","Mark Mason","Yes, that's still the target we\u2019re moving towards for branded cards, and that\u2019s after Tax Reform. ","John McDonald ","Okay. So kind of new tax rates maybe offsetting increased competition or stays about the same? ","Mark Mason","There\u2019s probably a little bit of upside to that. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O'Connor ","Are there any specific marks that you would want to call out either within Fixed Income trading or other areas related to hung deals, or obviously it\u2019s just kind of a tough December and spreads widened, and some of it's just kind of normal marks, but are there any specific marks you'd want to call out? And then have those reversed in January? There's been some articles out there talking about spreads tightening and banks able to offload some stuff they couldn't just last month. ","Mike Corbat ","The short answer to that is, no. That is not what we saw in our particular trading results. And to the extent we had those kind of marks, they\u2019d more likely end up in our loan revenue that we were talking about, and you can see we had fairly robust loan revenue growth again, so that's not what\u2019s impacting us.","Matt O'Connor ","Okay. And then just a bigger picture question, I mean obviously if we look at where bank stocks in general especially your stock, there's concern about a macro slowdown. I don't think we're seeing it outside of the capital market revenues in your results. But anything real time that you're seeing in the GTS business? Obviously you see a lot of global corporates, a lot of government data, you have the shutdown in the US. Just kind of any real time updates in terms of the macro conditions that you're seeing?","Mike Corbat ","What I\u2019d say is we see is we actually see a -- certainly US and even more broad global economy where the underlying fundamentals in particular on a domestic economy basis if you go around the world comprise of strong tight labor markets, reasonable wage increases, good consumption, while investment coming down, still reasonable. And I think the -- what's clearly in the fourth quarter overshadowed that was really market fears over what the transition from QE to QT might look and feel like. And obviously, we saw a lot being paid attention to pretty much any word that came out of the Fed\u2019s mouth. And I think the third piece is that adds to that volatility is things such as trade under, the on\/off again momentum of trade negotiations obviously affecting two of the biggest economies in the world. And I think when we put those three things together, we clearly see a disconnect between what we see in our business on an anecdotal basis and what the markets are saying. ","So, we don't see it, and I think what we've said before, and I think others have said before, is that right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy is one of talking ourselves into the next recession as opposed to the underlying fundamentals taking us there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. So I just wanted to hammer home one thing that you said, you said you want sacrifice key investments for competing in the future in response to the market conditions. I get it and you're doing that. But as you balance, you have a lot of targets out there and I think we\u2019re probably all over-obsessed over each basis point on them. But as you balance to hitting the targets versus the necessary investments, can we just rewind and go through what you think those couple of key investments -- I know there's more than that, but key investments to make you as you said competitive in 2019 and beyond, what's going to drive growth?","Mike Corbat ","Sure. So if you go back and you look at the last page or so that John talked about, when you look at underlying growth in the business, if you look at -- John talked about the $9 billion of TTS revenue growing at 11%, we talked about Securities Services, the Private Bank lending, Mexico, US Branded Cards, equities, M&A, if you just take those revenues and add them up, you're in excess of 50% of the revenue of the firm. And those are -- if you look at the momentum in those businesses, it\u2019s clearly strong. And what we don\u2019t want to do is stop that investment or do anything that has the potential to derail the growth that in every way we\u2019ve worked so hard, so hard to build. ","And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital, we talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through roughly the $200 million this year, manifesting itself in $500 million to $600 million incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business, coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of cutting marketing investment in terms of our platforms there, the investments that we\u2019ve started and have been executing against in terms of Mexico. I think all of these things you\u2019re seeing good -- and we have a lot of confidence in those paybacks. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in our list of investments, Glenn that would surprise you. And obviously, as the environment evolves, we\u2019re going to continue to watch those very carefully. And if we start to gain some of those lower priority, we\u2019re certainly willing to pull back on those. But what I don\u2019t want to do is get loaded to the start-stop, it\u2019s so disruptive. That right now I just described an economy where we don\u2019t see the underlying fundamentals having significantly changed. ","We saw that in 2011, we saw that again coming out of 2015 into 2016, in each of those timeframes, we went back to have better growth in recessionary periods all the way. I can\u2019t say that\u2019s the point this time, but what I don\u2019t want to do is I don\u2019t want to sacrifice that momentum that we\u2019ve got going right now as we go into 2019. But if and when appropriate, we\u2019re going to pull the levers we need to pull. ","Mark Mason","I\u2019m not sure, if you mentioned TTS in particular as well in addition to those businesses. We\u2019re putting more investment into that business, building out the client experience, building out the platform. That\u2019s always a business that\u2019s a large growing part of our franchise and we want to maintain the competitive position we have there. ","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate all that, if I could two quick what I\u2019d call annoying questions that come up plenty. One is, your exposure in lending into the CLO market as a lender and just maybe talk about your positioning there and then what collateral, what LTVs and what protections you have in that world? And then also just anything you\u2019d say about size of Sears and why, just because one retailer goes out doesn\u2019t mean people stop paying their bills?","Mike Corbat ","So I\u2019ll start off on the leverage lending fee. So first, from a direct exposure perspective, we talked about our corporate loan being largely investment grade. And as of the end of 2018, our exposure both funded and unfunded was roughly about 83% investment grade. So less than about 20% is not rated investment grade and of that about 55% is funded. And of course, all of these exposures are subject to our risk appetite framework, and we feel really comfortable with that.","So although leverage lending is not a material component of our overall lending business, we do, of course, participate in the space to serve our target clients in the ICG. And when we look at that, we would also have some exposure to leverage loans related to CLOs and there are two places where that exposure resides. So one is in our markets business, and the other is in our investment portfolio. So in both cases there are limits that are imposed on you exposure and our exposures are the core -- again are a core subject to our overall risk framework. ","In our markets business, we serve as a warehouse lender and an underwriter for our CLO manager clients and we made markets for our investor clients in the secondary market for CLOs. I\u2019d make a couple of comments on the warehouse lending that we do, which is subject to an aggregate $5 billion exposure limit. First, there are some structural protections that are in place that have been enhanced since the crisis. Second, unlike the pre-crisis, our CLO primary syndicate does not retain any residual exposure post the issuance. And as I said, we do make markets for our investor clients in the secondary market, but that exposure is subject to a market risk RWA limit of about $1.5 billion. ","So as far as our investment portfolio is concerned, the holdings are well diversified and represent exposure to about 75 unique CLOs. And those investments are limited to most senior tranches of the CLOs that are rated triple-A. There are also some restrictions in terms of structure. For example we only invest in CLOs which include performance triggers. And so net-net, we feel pretty good about our exposure. We're not heavy into leverage lending. If you look at some of the underwriting charts we write pretty low on those underwriting charts. And so we feel pretty good about where we stand at this point. ","Glenn Schorr","In terms of Sears?","Mike Corbat ","Sure. So in terms of Sears, as you know, we don't comment on retail partner financial conditions. But I guess what I will say, if you'll recall that last quarter we indicated an upfront impact under a full liquidation scenario for Sears that could be in the range of about $300 million. And that included certain accruals. The write-down of a portion of our related intangibles and the time and cost of migrating the cardholders to other Citi products. Today, we'd expect that that total impact would be more like $200 million. So the impact has declined due in part to an additional quarter of intangible amortization as well as a refinement to our original estimate. ","By the way I'd point out that we booked a small reserve in the fourth quarter that's associated with certain contingent liabilities. But if Sears pursued a liquidation in the near term, you can think about the vast majority of this impact coming in the first half of 2019. And again much of the impact would have otherwise been recognized as ongoing amortization expense by the end of '19 anyway. So the net incremental impact would likely be less than the $100 million for the full year. And beyond that upfront impact and acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the Retail Services revenues, perhaps resulting to a flat top-line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions. ","John Gerspach ","And Glenn, just specific to your question in there, again we've talked about it before, but you've got a program card here where 70% of the volume on that card is out of store which is consistent with top of wallet. So this is not just an in-store product but it's a utility product for these people where they're using in broadly. So I think the access to that and the access to the credit and the top of wallet nature we take comfort in, in terms of people's desire to keep that outstanding.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. I have a question on efficiency and slide 17, and slide 17 showed an improving efficiency for the last two years. We can go back further and see improving efficiency. So, when we look at your efficiency business line by business by, it looks worse than peer. So, my question is, what else can you do to improve intensity of expense control? And I'm not talking about cutting CapEx or long-term investments. Mike, I heard what you said. You don't want to have stop-start, stop-start. But, what are you doing for travel, entertainment, Black Cards, Ubers, size of coffee cups, paper cups, the sort of tone at the top that says hey, we've made a lot of progress, but we still a long way to go. We don't always get that sense or I don't personally always get that sense that this is a firm that needs to better optimize notwithstanding how far you\u2019ve come.","Mike Corbat","Mike, I think you've got to go back and put it in a little bit of context of history. Having gone through the crisis and the things that we needed to do, we cut back, we curtailed, we stopped a lot of those things and tightly monitored those things that you mentioned. So, it wasn't we came out of the crisis and everybody's flying around the world first class and staying in five-star hotels. We put in place, we maintain and monitor strict travel policies in terms of off-sites, in terms of all the spends that we have. We put them in place, we monitor and we continue to take efficiencies from those. So, it's not like they were there and in better times, they went away and we're putting them back. We obviously continue to monitor and push those. So, probably why you don't hear about and this is because they\u2019ve got put in place and we just continue to push them as opposed to putting new things on.","But, in the environment as we sit, we're going to do the appropriate things of making sure that we continue to push ourselves on the expense front, at the same time knowing that we've got to create our own capacity to invest. So, we take it seriously, we take it with a sense of urgency. And as a firm, I would say, we're all over it.","Mike Mayo","I have a follow-up then, maybe one for John and one for Mark. John, you have made progress but maybe not -- maybe you didn't get everything done that you wanted to get done. So, as you look at Citi, as you are about to leave, where do you see some possibilities that you didn't get exactly what you wanted? And then, Mark, what's the difference in your approach versus John and how you're going to look at things and some maybe nuance changes?","John Gerspach","Mike, when you look at -- actually the answer to both the question you asked to Mike and to me, when you look at the efficiency by business, most of the work still has to get done in the consumer business. And if you look at where we need to focus, it certainly isn't in the cards business. I think you understand and we understand cards is already a very efficient business. You need to improve the efficiency in our retail business. And that's what a lot of the investments are focused on and that's where we also need to be able to grow our revenue. So, I'd say that that's a business that is going to need improvement going forward. And it's one that we highlighted when we laid out at Investor Day. So, again, that's where we're geared going forward. But that's -- it's the overall efficiency in the consumer business where we still have some work to do. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark?","Mark Mason","Yes. I guess, I'd say, one, I'd like to just echo the point that we are intensely focused on this. We're focused on not only the efficiency, but on delivering the return target that we set. And so, you've seen the numbers, we've gone from an 8.1 return on tangible common equity last year to a target of 10.5 this year to delivering a 10.9 this year as an actual number. And I recognize that that is still sort of where we've targeted for ourselves going forward. And I recognize we've got a 12% return on tangible common equity for 2019. But as both Mike and John have said, we're preparing for varying operating environments, and doing so in a way that we can ensure that we still hit that 12%. And that involves all of the line items. That involves what we can do to continue to realize the benefits and the momentum we're seeing in the strong parts of the franchise, many of which both Mike and John have gone through. It involves us delivering on the savings from productivity, the $500 million to $600 million that largely should offset the volume and compensation growth that we see in revenue growth going into \u201819. It involves continuing to manage the cost of credit. And we think the fourth quarter run -- the fourth quarter number is probably a good run rate looking into 2019. It involves continuing to manage the tax line. That number\u2019s come in better than what we expected when we talked about 2018 performance. And it involves managing the balance sheet. And again, as we grow -- as we saw the fourth quarter come down in revenues, we were able to bring our risk-weighted assets down as well.","And so, my commitment is probably a lot simpler and that probably is a lot similar to what John's commitment and Mike's commitment has been, is my commitment is the execution of the strategy that we've talked about, delivering against the targets that we\u2019ve set, and building in the flexibility that allows for us to manage in uncertain environments.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So, I was trying to unpack some of the revenue guidance for 2019. And given some of the favorable guidance you gave on NII, up $2 billion year-on-year. It implies that you should be able to hit that 3% revenue growth call even with the income staying flattish in \u201819. I'm just wondering, is that the right way to interpret the guidance? And is that why you specifically mentioned the flattish fee income growth, almost at a floor for \u201819 and certainly you conveyed a very positive tone on your ability to hit that 3% target? ","Mark Mason","Yes. So, I'd say two things. One, you're spot on in terms of the NII and we feel like our ability to deliver on the $2 billion or so or similar performance from what we saw in 2018. And then, in terms of the noninterest revenue, as we mentioned, that was a decline this year. We would -- we should certainly see growth in the noninterest revenue this year. But, we do have to keep in mind that our reported growth for noninterest revenue will look a little bit lower than the underlying because of a number of one-timers including the wind down of legacy assets and things like the Hilton gain and the Visa B share gains et cetera. So, I think the way you can think about it is that the bulk of the reported growth that we'd expect to see next year would come in the NII line, but we would not see the decline in noninterest revenue and perhaps even see some upside there.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Okay. And switching gears for a moment just to capital targets. We\u2019ve heard some recent rhetoric come out of the fed on capital rules and the SCB. And something that they\u2019ve made pretty clear and the word choice that they\u2019ve used is that the industry currently holds adequate levels of capital. So, it certainly suggests, rules are unlikely to get tougher from here. At the same time, it\u2019s less clear whether we\u2019re going to see meaningful relief either. And I\u2019m just wondering, based on your discussions with regulators, expectations for the SCB, whether your thinking has evolved on your long-term capital target and 11% to 11.5%? Do you still view that goal as being appropriate, based on your current vantage point?","Mike Corbat","I think with the SCB getting pushed out to 2020, what we would say is, we\u2019ve covered it publicly about the 11.5. And I would say, based on what we know today, that continues to feel to be the right neighborhood for us. Obviously, as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to refine that. But, I think, we\u2019re quite comfortable with the 11.5 today.","John Gerspach","I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to Mike\u2019s comments is that that 11.5 that we laid out there, that that was never intended to be a bright line limit. And there\u2019s a great deal of variability and many of the components, some of the things that you just talked about that go into calculating, the CET1 ratio. So, we would expect to operate on an ongoing basis with the CET1 ratio in the range of 11.5%. So, in other words, we may periodically dip slightly below that 11.5% and that would still be okay.","Steven Chubak","One final question for me. Just on noninterest bearing deposits, you reported another 5% drop off in those balances in 4Q. This appears to be more an industry-wide phenomenon. But, I was hoping, you could speak to which segment specifically are seeing the steepest declines. And maybe what\u2019s your expectation in terms of where that could bottom as a percentage of total deposits?","John Gerspach","I\u2019m not going to give any guidance as to where it could bottom. But, what we have seen is most of that decline obviously is in U.S. retail, which is where the bulk of our noninterest bearing deposits are. And there what we\u2019ve seen is two things. We\u2019ve seen flows out of the noninterest bearing directly into interest bearing, and we\u2019ve also seen flows going into investment products. I\u2019d say that in -- especially in the second half of this year, we\u2019ve seen flows -- overall flows in our consumer retail deposits -- excluding commercial deposits that pretty much have normalized now. We\u2019re basically -- if you look -- if you could look underneath the numbers, U.S. retail consumer deposits are virtually flat from an end-of-period basis, end of 2017 to 2018. And that\u2019s -- again, we are getting a new money, most of the new money is coming into interest-bearing account CDs, but some is coming into the checking. We\u2019re continuing to grow our wealth management clients. We increased Citigold household by another 18% this year. And what that means, though, is that those clients are operating where we would expect those clients to operate, which is they\u2019re starting to move money into investments. But, we\u2019re retaining -- in the second half of the year, our retention rate on those flows into investment accounts improved to 75%. So, we think right now we\u2019re in a fairly good balance. But, you\u2019re still going to see a bit of a shift going forward from non-interest bearing into interest bearing.","Mark Mason","Just keep in mind, our U.S. retail deposits are about $150 billion out of the $1 trillion of total deposits we have.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you both. And John, congrats on retirement.","John Gerspach","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks Management.","Marty Mosby","I had a few questions about just what you're seeing in these particular businesses. If you look at fixed income, the pullback in yield from when it hit highs kind of late summer into the fall, kind of throws all your yield investors off, because they finally started to see rates starting to pick up. And then, all of a sudden it just comes right back and they just get kind of frozen like I wish I would have bought yesterday kind of thing. How do you see that kind of evolving? Have you seen any of this? It kind falls over time because they have to kind of get back to, okay, well this is just where we're at, we can get higher rates. So, let's go ahead and start doing that. Was some of that part of what we saw in the fourth quarter and we've seen any signs of that change through the first quarter?","Mike Corbat","Marty, the fourth quarter was one of those quarters where there was so much volatility. It's not necessarily whether interest rates are moving up or down. You can certainly get good client engagement and a lot of activity in either of those cases. It's where the market appears somewhat directionless or people aren't quite sure exactly how far something is going. So, this is this concept that people have talked about as being bad volatility. And that's really what we saw in the fourth quarter where the volatility was just so much that people didn't know when to jump in. And therefore they -- everybody just stayed on the sidelines. That\u2019s what we saw. And I commented when I spoke at the Goldman Conference. My comments there were about the lack of client engagement that we had begun to see in the G10 Rates area of our business. And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year-over-year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates. With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income. And that's what really led to the change from being slightly down to where you see today where the combination of equities and FICC ended up being down 14%. But, most of that really was in fixed income. It was in the second half of the quarter and predominantly in December. Now, we have seen some improvement in trading conditions with volatility moderating and both equity and yield showing signs of stabilization early in January. But, it certainly is very early at this point in time. And, I would still say that market conditions have yet to fully recover.","John Gerspach","And I think, look, Marty, what you saw in particular in the later stages of the fourth quarter and you could see it manifest when you look at fund returns for the quarter, where people went from in some cases having pretty reasonable years to actually having down years, we really saw kind of a mindset that manifested itself in similar ways for those people that managed to get there and be up. They wanted to protect their ups and weren't willing to necessarily be that active. And those that were down said I'm down, I don't want to risk being down further. And so, we really saw precipitous drop off in terms of client activity, as a result of that.","Marty Mosby","That makes sense. And if you look at the debt underwriting, came in a little bit better. There's a lot of discussion about liquidity in the market beginning to pull back, but I guess rates coming down. So, I just kind of want to balance what you saw with the liquidity market versus with equity underwriting kind of having its trouble with the valuations coming down, maybe more were pouring into debt underwriting. But, I thought I did a little bit better. I just thought maybe there was a balance between the liquidity and the rates coming down and getting some deals done in the particular fourth quarter.","Mike Corbat","Overall, Marty, debt underwriting, it may have been a little bit better than people were fearing, but it still was not exactly what I would call a strong environment by any stretch of the imagination. And even -- and that pretty much persisted almost throughout the year. Market wallets and debt capital market were pretty much down 29% during the quarter. So, again, maybe not as bad as people thought about, but it was still a pretty dramatic reduction. Equity markets were down; wallet was down about 36% in the quarter year-over-year and debt about 29%. So, yes, equities were down a little bit more than debt, but you're still talking about some pretty significant drop-offs in market wallets, fourth quarter \u201818 compared to fourth quarter 2017.","Marty Mosby","Then, lastly, a more global question. If you look about and think about this where we're seeing valuations right now and particularly your valuation being below tangible book value, if we take -- let\u2019s say, you take off the table recession or not, because I think that is the biggest part of the question and assume, as you all kind of foreshadowed as well as our models foreshadow that we're not heading into that recession unless we talk ourselves into it. Then, it really becomes returns versus your cost of equity as long as you're being able to improve returns like you have, and I think we've kind of crossed that threshold of cost of equity, but just wanted to make sure where do you kind of peg that cost of equity. And do you see in your mind that you are kind of building that excess return? And if you're not going in a recession and you're generating excess returns, then a discount to tangible value is definitely not reasonable at this point.","John Gerspach","Yes. We think we've clearly crossed that. So, it\u2019s the 10.9 that has been referenced, again call it a circa 10% cost of equity. So, we think we're above that; and clearly as we execute against the trajectory this year to 12, obviously clearly above that, and above 12, 13 plus and beyond.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can I just ask one question on lending? It looks like you guys, like the industry, saw really good growth, especially on the North America side and in EMEA, especially in corporate banking, and it looks like some was in the markets business. Can you just give us some color on was that in your view just core underlying economic improvement, akin to like you talked about earlier? Was some of it related to the market disconnect and perhaps might be fleeting and kind of was on-balance sheet off-balance sheet? How would you just help us understand this big surge in corporate lending that you guys saw this quarter?","John Gerspach","When you look at the corporate lending -- and corporate lending, I think it grew about 2% sequentially; it's about up 6% -- I'm talking about the average balances that we give you in the back of the earnings deck. And that loan growth was pretty much spread across various components. I'd say that overall there was still good corporate demand for loans. We saw a good corporate demand. It did range a little bit different by geography. And how we chose to address it, we had a lot of strong client demand in Asia, for instance. And yet if you look, you'll see that our Asia loans were actually down sequentially and year-over-year. And that's just because that demand was at spreads and we didn't feel were appropriate. And so, we just chose not to participate.","Some of the things that we did do in our say TTS business is where we saw that the spreads didn't quite meet our hurdle rate, we still originated the loans but we originated them for distribution. So, again, pretty good demand. There is -- in the markets area that you mentioned, a lot of that growth is driven by some year-end Community Reinvestment Act lending. That's where we do -- that's the segment of the business where we do our Community Reinvestment Act. But, there's also an element of some residential warehouse lending that is in there that we would expect then to clear out sometime in the first quarter as securitizations are executed.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And, John, just to follow-up, you mentioned some pockets where spreads are tight. How would you just characterize the overall commercial side, that lending environment out there? Is there an opportunity to take back some market share away from the non-bank segments that have been tougher the whole industry? I know you guys seeing some of those opportunities.","John Gerspach","I'd say yes. But don't forget, I think a lot of those opportunities are going to be in what I would consider to be the small to medium type of operations. And we're not a big player in what we will consider to be the CCB business, the commercial aspect of it. We certainly are growing in that business. But, it's not a large enough segment for us that would necessarily drive a significant amount of loan growth in 2019.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. John, I can't believe we can't ask you questions on the call next quarter.","John Gerspach","You can, I just won\u2019t to answer.","Betsy Graseck","Terrible. Good luck and enjoy. We're going to miss you.","John Gerspach","Yes. And I know you\u2019re going to like Mark a lot more. He's a lot more user friendly than I am, so.","Betsy Graseck","I don't know. All right. I've enjoyed your non-user friendliness actually. Maybe we could just -- my last question for you here is around the outlook for the long-term RoTCE, and I know on this probably we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about the outlook and the flex points that we have for \u201819. And I am just thinking, as I -- because we do model out next several years, you've mentioned in the past year the 16% that you put out there a couple quarters ago with 14 plus 2 for tax reform. But maybe you could give us a sense of, are there -- is there anything incremental to how you think about what the drivers are of that 16% beyond what we discussed as drivers for the 12% for next year?","John Gerspach","Well, I think Mark laid out a whole -- and I laid out some drivers and I think Mark commented on them earlier as well. But, again, we laid out that 16% of tax rates are finding our way to a lower effective tax rate than we had originally thought that we\u2019d be able to achieve. And I think that there\u2019s still some additional work that we can do there. But, outside of that -- it is going to come down to those core elements of improving that efficiency ratio, seeing better growth in the consumer business and the accrual businesses. You\u2019re already seeing that in the ICG. I just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about, and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses, you\u2019ve seen the core accrual revenue grow $4 billion year-over-year. We talked about the fact that masking that has been some underlying impacts in that fee-driven revenue, the non-interest revenue that we think now we\u2019ve lapped. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new that needs to be done in order to get to that 16%. And I think there\u2019s a whole series of opportunities that Mark and the team are going to continue to unearth.","Betsy Graseck","One question there is on the provision line. And I know you indicated the 3.25, 5.25 range for the card. Does the comment around provision -- should I take away from that that you feel that you are at normalized provision levels for your book at this stage?","John Gerspach","At this stage, we\u2019re at normalized provisions in consumer. I\u2019d say that 2018 was a bit of a great -- a very good year for corporate credit. Fourth quarter I think is probably more indicative of where you will see the lost -- the overall cost of credit for ICG. But we\u2019re certainly not looking at any sort of significant ramp-up in cost of credit over the next couple days. Other than as loan portfolios continue to grow and season, you\u2019re going to get some natural increase. But those loss rates, we feel pretty good about those loss rates.","Betsy Graseck","And as you think about the segments and the geographies for hitting these targets into 2020 or long term, I call that like 2020 I guess. But, as you hit what you\u2019re looking for in the U.S. retail card, do you migrate more capital towards emerging markets, you migrate more capital to Mexico and Asia, which have been growing faster, or do you feel like this current mix is -- you can hit the 16% with the correct mix?","Mark Mason","Yes. I think, when we put together the targets, it reflected where we thought we\u2019d see the opportunity, so continued momentum out of Mexico, momentum out of Asia albeit, as John has described, we\u2019re seeing some pressure in the retail banking part of the business, particularly invest in investments. And so, as you would imagine, we\u2019re constantly looking at the client demand that\u2019s out there juxtaposed against returns and growth opportunities and recalibrating and reallocating resources accordingly. But at this point in time, I\u2019d say that mix that we\u2019ve talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading. I guess the final point I\u2019d make on that as is as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business I saw pressure in fixed income in particular, you'll see us manage the balance sheet. We\u2019ve brought risk-weighted assets down; we ended with the risk-weighted assets of a $1.170 trillion versus the $1.196 trillion last quarter. And in this case, you saw our CT1 ratio go up to 11.90.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. I know we've get the VAR numbers in the 10-Q, 10-K. So, I assume we'll see some reflection of that there as well. Anything in rates in fixed income? I know we\u2019ve talked through a lot of high yield spread credit widening and how that's not really impacting you much. But, I was just wondering on a rate side, the volatility that existed in rates?","John Gerspach","When you take a look at the decline in FICC revenues, most of it was centered in G10 Rates. So, that was a big driver of the year-over-year decline in FICC. When we look at it -- and you can see in the supplement, I think. When you look spread products year-over-year, we're off by 3%. Now, remember, we had a miserable fourth quarter last year in spread products. So, on a relative basis, it was kind of an easy comp. But, the bulk of the year-over-year decline is in rates and currencies, and within that most of the decline is centered in G10 Rates.","Betsy Graseck","And there was that one-off that was reported post the Goldman Conference, but that was in your Goldman Conference comments I would think, right?","John Gerspach","That was embedded in the guidance that that I gave at Goldman, absolutely. But, even with -- even taking that loss out, fixed income would still be down mid-teens year-over-year, and again, the loss really in G10 Rates.","Betsy Graseck","So, then, last is just -- I got a question this morning on the PG&E utility company that suggested that they might be reporting bankruptcy this year or filing for bankruptcy this week. You have some exposure to them. Could just talk us through how you deal with those kind of events? I know we\u2019ve talked through Sears earlier.","John Gerspach","Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't comment specifically on any client. But, in general, we have a very strict risk appetite framework that we apply. You see that reflected in the overall statistics for our corporate book which is in excess of 80% investment grade. So, any exposure that we would have to any type of company that you're reading about is certainly going to be manageable.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Well, John, it's been great working with you; and Mark, looking forward to it. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thanks, Betsy.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","A quick question on the tax rate. When you gave the updated guidance at the end of \u201818, you had said that the 2020 was expected to be effectively lower than what it was in 2019, even though tax rates down, were at 24% and less than 24%. Does that same relationship hold even though you've dropped down the tax rate guidance? So now you're at 23% for \u201819. Are you still expecting \u201820 to be below 23%?","John Gerspach","Well, let's leave it at least equal to that 23% for \u201819 until we're ready to come out with anything further. But, again, as we indicated in the guidance, we do think that there are opportunities that we have to go lower than the 23%. We're not prepared to give guidance on that yet.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks. And then the other question was on your 2020 targets, you have that 3% revenue CAGR kind of embedded in there to get to those targets. But since you missed revenue growth this year, you\u2019re really kind of looking at now in the 4% [ph] in the next two years to still stay at a 3% for the full time period. So, is that kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it and how dependent is hitting those 2020 targets on revenue growth alone?","Mike Corbat","So, when you look at that, as we've described that at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost to credit, and obviously significant capital return. And so, we've talked about the leverage here as we went through. One is obviously the revenue momentum that's going on in parts of our businesses, the more annuity like. We spoke to the expense saves, so, the 200 manifesting itself to 500 to 600 and then another 500 to 600. Earlier on in the year, John had talked about that we're actually outperforming on the expense front and we could get incremental couple of hundred million dollars of expense saves that would come through. Obviously, we talked about the legacy assets piece, we talked about FDIC surcharge, we talked about the tax rate. And again, we feel confident -- again, don't have scenarios or anything yet, but feel good about capital returns. And as we look to the future, 11.9 down to 11.5 and the combination of earnings, DTA utilization which we don't talk about much more but it's there and it's reasonably significant and obviously continuing to close that gap between 11.9 and 11.5 or wherever that number is. So, we think we've got a number of levers that we can pull as we go forward.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Just one last one. You said that you're expecting -- I guess that it is pure rate hikes in \u201819 versus \u201818. So, how do you think about deposit betas if there are less rate hikes? Thanks. ","John Gerspach","Well, the deposit betas are likely -- certainly on the retail side, they're likely to continue to increase into \u201819 even if there are no further rate hikes. In our plans, we're assuming that there's one rate hike in \u201819 but we still are assuming that there's going to be some increase in retail deposit betas. And if we look back at the last time rates increased, deposit betas -- retail deposit betas continued to increase for some time after the last rate increase. We have seen stabilization on the betas on the corporate deposits. And so, there may be some continued pressure upward there but much less so. To the extent there's going to be any I think large moves in beta, it'll be on the retail side. And that's again baked into all the guidance that we've given.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning. Couple of quick ones hopefully. First, more of a geography question on the FDI surcharge benefit of about 140, 150 million. How is that distributed between the North American consumer and ICG? Is it there\u2019s a vast majority of it in North American consumer, is there a portion also migrating to ICG? ","John Gerspach","No. Actually that -- the 140 is not separately isolated within our -- the overall FDIC assessment that we get. So, apportion that out as we do with all the other aspects of the FDIC assessment. And it goes to -- it goes globally to all of our businesses around the world. So, if you want to think about it, it's actually two-thirds of the overall FDIC assessment ends up in ICG and only one-third in consumer. So, it would be less than a third of that benefit that shows up in U.S. consumer.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So, it\u2019s allocated roughly in line with the overall distribution of deposits essentially?","John Gerspach","No, it's actually allocated based upon a much more complicated formula than that, because it's not deposits that give rise to the assessment. There's a whole series of other risk indicators that actually drive your assessment. And so, we actually apportion that assessment among the businesses based upon their contribution to the risk factors that go into the assessment calculation itself.","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And secondly, I guess a much broader question. Any updated thoughts on the political dynamics in Mexico? It does seem like there's been at least a bit more recent movement by the government to engage with the banking system in a more constructive way. I'm just curious if you guys sense that. And just your overall level of optimism that maybe things aren't necessarily getting better from a political standpoint, but at the very least, there's no signs of deterioration in terms of the policy landscape?","Mike Corbat","Yes. So, we're early, right? We've -- President has been in office since December 1. I think he and his team continue to find their feet. And I think what you're referencing most recently was that they've kind of come out and they've been very clear in terms of wanting to become more inclusive in terms of banking. But in there, they've involved the finance ministry, they involved the local bank and banking associations in terms of I think working quite consciously and artfully to craft that message in a constructive way. So, it's early, but I would say that the interactions that we've seen have been positive. And I think the underlying piece of that is we've -- as was referencing some of the conversations before, we've got it, environment there right now, where we've got consumer sentiment really at or near all-time highs. And so, you've got an engaged consumer. And I think they're very mindful to try and want to keep that consumer engaged.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, everyone. Can you share with us, John? You touched on how the growth in TTS this quarter was due to wider spreads and also higher volumes and transactions? If you had to rank the three reasons why you had the better growth year-over-year, which one of those contributes to most of that growth?","John Gerspach","They all contribute. And it's -- I'm trying to rank them. And I think it's actually -- it's the volumes that are driving things more than anything else. The deposit volumes and the transaction volumes would be the ones that are driving it. Rates is having an impact, but it's really the volumes that we're seeing in the deposit growth as well as the transaction volumes that are driving the revenues. And those transaction volumes are -- there's spread between things like commercial cars, just the traditional interaction that we've got on moving cash, but there's a whole series of working capital solutions that we're rolling out. So, that's one of the reasons why we feel really good about the long-term growth prospects of TTS, because again, it's not just being driven by one specific thing that if that stops, suddenly all the air goes out of the balloon. It\u2019s really a business that is multifaceted growth engines at this point in time.","Gerard Cassidy","And, John, how is -- I mean, you\u2019ve got such a global footprint here in this area, new business or new client growth. Is that a contributor each year as well that actually moves the dial or is it just a steady at 1% to 3% or 4% new customer growth?","John Gerspach","No. No, no, no. There\u2019s just definitely -- I don\u2019t have the number in my head, but we don\u2019t have a 100% penetration on our corporate client base with TTS. As strange as that may be, as good as we are, we don\u2019t have a 100%. So, we have the ability to introduce that TTS product set into new clients every year, and we are doing it. And then, once you\u2019re into new clients, what you\u2019re likely to get is, you get one of their regions or maybe several of their countries. And therefore, there\u2019s the ability then to grow into multiple countries, multiple regions, and it\u2019s been -- a lot of that is what has fueled the volume growth in TTS. I think, overall, Gerard, we\u2019ve got like something like a low-double-digit market share in TTS, maybe it\u2019s 10% or 11%. Whatever it is, it\u2019s relatively small. And there still is a sizable growth opportunity in TTS.","Mark Mason","And, John, to your point, it\u2019s not just growing with new multi-national clients, but also with smaller clients that are looking to go global. And given the breadth of our franchise, we\u2019re positioned to take advantage of both of those opportunities and serve both types of those clients.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And shifting gears with you guys. Can you give us any color on investment banking pipelines? Obviously, we know what happened in the fourth quarter in December in particular. What are you guys expecting or seeing for the upcoming quarter in those pipelines?","John Gerspach","Pipeline remains, I\u2019d say very, very strong, and client dialogue remains strong. And we\u2019ve got a very healthy backlog going into 2019. We just need the right environment to execute it.","Gerard Cassidy","Right. Okay. And John, certainly back to your comments on the G10 Rates business, how it really fell off. When you look at it by customer segment that you trade with, was it more of the market traders, many hedge funds, or was it loan-onlys or sovereign wealth funds? Who really sort of fall off the most from your customer standpoint?","John Gerspach","Early in the quarter, I\u2019d say, it was fairly concentrated and little more in the investor clients. But as the quarter proceeded, we saw both investor and corporate clients move to the sidelines.","Gerard Cassidy","I see, very good. And echoing others, we\u2019re going to really miss your candor and frankness. And good luck in those retirement years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian ","Sorry to prolong this but I actually had a question. Thank you so much for all the guidance that you\u2019ve already given us on the revenue outlook and expenses. And I heard you loud and clear, John that the efficiency improvement in \u201819 will be wider than the 90 basis points that we saw in \u201818. Assuming that low-50 sort of starts at 53% and it\u2019s top of the range for 2020. I\u2019m wondering, is the improvement in efficiency in \u201819 going to be about equal to \u201820 or is it going to be accelerating improvement into 2020 sort of like you\u2019re implying with what has happened in \u201818 and \u201819 if that question is clear?","Mark Mason","It's going to be accelerating. This is Mark. It's going to be accelerating into 2020.","Erika Najarian","Okay. And one more -- go ahead, John.","Mark Mason","If you look there what we just talked about from the expense side of things, we talked about a recognition of 200 this year going to 500, 600 next year of going to an incremental 500 or 600 in \u201820. So, as the investment spend comes to maturity, our ability to accelerate on the expense side manifests itself.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Most investors -- just a quick follow-up question are investing -- are expecting that the Fed will not raise rates anymore in 2019. Given the different tailwinds that you noted for net interest revenues, I'm wondering what the downside risk is to that $2 billion in growth if the Fed's last rate hike was December?","John Gerspach","Go ahead, Mark.","Mark Mason","Yes. This is Mark. So, I mean, look, in the past, in 2017, we talked about roughly $100 million benefit per quarter for 25 basis-point Fed rate hike. And if you think about for the most recent rate hike in 2018, we're only assuming a benefit of about $55 million a quarter. And so, my point in that and all of this is consistent with our U.S. dollar IRE disclosures in the K and Q. We're not heavily dependent on this midyear 2019 hike in order to deliver on our outlook for 2019.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. ","Al Alevizakos","Thank you for taking my question. So you mentioned during the presentation that Asian wealth management was one of the weak areas in the quarter. That doesn't really strike me as a surprise. However, I would like to know what do you think is happening and what is your outlook for 2019? And was the weakness just because of AUM or was it something else as well?","And then, secondly, just want to confirm on your comment on equities excluding the one-off loss that you had previously. Were the revenues down year-on-year? Because you mentioned, [indiscernible] was offset by weaker prime brokerage? Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","Let's take the second one first on the equities. Yes, excluding that the one loss that we talked about last year would still be, as I said down slightly year-over-year. So, think it slightly as being something in the single digit, low-single digits mid-single digits type of range. And so, does that get you where you need to go on the equities? And that is yes.","Al Alevizakos","Yes.","John Gerspach","Okay. And then, when you think about Asia, when we look at Asia, it really is just that runoff investment revenues. And we generate -- I think I mentioned this on last quarter's call, one of the things that we're trying to rebalance in Asia is that a lot of our investment sales generate revenues on the front end as opposed to being continuing fees as the investment keeps ongoing. So, to the extent we get periods like this where there is investors are not moving money into new investments, it hurts us on the fee line. Now, we're converting more of those investment products in Asia into more backend loaded, more consistency fees. We can get away from this frontloaded concept front loaded concept, but we haven't done that as yet. So, that certainly is one of the things that is going on. And we have seen, consistent with some of the things I talked about with the trading; we have seen some pick up in investment sales in early January. But, again, it's early and certainly not back to where we want it to be.","Al Alevizakos","Thank you for that. Could we say that the performance in the U.S. wealth management was particularly different in the fourth quarter compared to Asia?","John Gerspach","Well, Asia, it\u2019s a much bigger wealth management business in Asia. That's a business that we've been developing for several years now. The U.S., we're really only into maybe the second, maybe it's 2.5 years of really focusing on wealth management. So, I think that you see similar results but it's just the U.S. business is relatively small at this point in time.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. ","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Thanks. Sorry to holding up longer. A couple of questions. The decline in risk-weighted assets from -- was that all from trading? And if the markets do recover, should we expect that to go back up?","John Gerspach","It's primarily concentrated in credit risk assets. The bulk of it would be in the markets businesses. But, it's fairly widespread across ICG. And it depends on when the markets and when the sentiment comes up and then what else -- where else we -- how else we deploy our capital. But, if you look, you'll see that there's some variability I'll call it in our risk-weighted assets. And that's pretty much just dependent on client needs and customer demands.","Vivek Juneja","Right, okay. Because you are a regular market maker, so I would expect that if things do come back, you would be very much there in part of it.","John Gerspach","Absolutely, absolutely.","Vivek Juneja","Second one, little one which is what is the dollar amount of your wealth management revenues in Asia in 4Q \u201818 and what was it in 4Q \u201917? Because you gave us the last 12 months, but it's hard to get a real sense of what the revenues actual work did in year-on-year -- without the actual number for the quarter.","John Gerspach","Vivek, I don't have that number in front of me. I\u2019ll have to -- Susan will have to get back to you with something, if it\u2019s there.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And lastly LatAm consumer, what do you need to do to get back to positive operating leverage year-on-year, which wasn't the case this quarter?","John Gerspach","Taking a look at operating leverage quarter-to-quarter that's\u2026","Vivek Juneja","No. Year-on-year -- yes. ","John Gerspach","I think if you take a look at it on a full-year basis, that\u2019s a much better gauge of what you're doing in a business because you're going to have quarters like this where you have a slight decline in the retail revenues. So, I would look at the business on a full-year basis. And we've been pretty consistent with positive operating leverage coming out of Mexico in particular and we would expect to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in 2019 as well. So, it's a one quarter.","Vivek Juneja","But if I look at, John, full-year \u201818 ex the gain on the sale of asset management business, is it essentially revenue growth and expense growth or -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars are essentially the same, so that would say no positive offering leverage?","John Gerspach","Well, based on the fact that we knew that that gain was coming and so we paced our investment spending to take advantage of the fact that we had the gain. And so, for the full-year, we were still managing to positive operating leverage. Just as I'm sure that you'd want us, if we knew that there was a large loss coming and your expectation would be that we would manage those expenses down somewhat in order to produce a better efficiency ratio and the operating leverage ratio, right?","Vivek Juneja","Okay. All right. Thank you. And good luck, John.","John Gerspach","Thanks a lot, Vivek.","Operator","There are no further questions.

Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter.","Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade solutions, Investment Banking and our private bank, as well as across our equities and fixed income businesses.","In Consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking.","And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans, and card purchase sales and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios.","We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016.","Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets.","Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp, while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet.","We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis.","I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last three years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, a Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity.","At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets, while at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012. Excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers.","Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup and we reached 11% excluding the capital which supports our disallowed DTA.","In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve.","And as an example, we've exited or are in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven and now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet and not only as holdings broken even, it\u2019s been profitable for six straight quarters.","Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over one third. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model.","The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our Institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains.","In Global Consumer, we've reduced our brand's footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest growing cities, while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year.","Our customer satisfaction is measured by net promoter scores has improved meaningfully. We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings.","We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012 we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last three years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last three years.","Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders and we've reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend.","We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope.","We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. Everyday we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution.","While as the early days of 2016 have shown, the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging. And while there are bright spots such as the US, Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict.","Volatility may present some trading opportunities but more often keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment.","As I discussed earlier, we've worked hard to transform our company and the changes we've made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower return consumer markets.","We run a very balanced and tightly risk managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients. And our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry.","John will now go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA\/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","On slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation.","In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. Expenses declined 23% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation.","And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year. On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 57.3%.","Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion.","On slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year driven by growth across our institutional franchise.","Citicorp expenses declined 24% reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net reserve build.","Turning to Citi Holdings, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets.","We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt and we position Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. The net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.","While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin, as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves.","On slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs.","And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3% while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points.","As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise.","Turning to each business. On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year.","In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio.","We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact however with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues, as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards.","We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remained fairly stable sequentially and we continued to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region.","And in retail banking, we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues.","In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs, as well as ongoing efficiency savings.","And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets.","However, we did see an up-tick in net credit losses in certain markets in our Commercial business, which serves small and mid-size companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter, as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized.","Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4% reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads.","In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.","We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total US branded card loans.","And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.","Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 1% from last year mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales.","Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6% driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings, as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.","As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our six key markets where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels.","Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an up-tick in the NCL rate to 4.8%.","But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio including losses on a wind down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves.","Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region.","Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower than expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year with broad based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%.","Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars driven by growth in high quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis.","Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year, while our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity.","Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year with share gains across debt and loan origination and M&A revenues grew 15%.","Private bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And corporate lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads.","Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty.","Turning to equities, revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Security Services revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.","Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.","Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy related.","We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about two thirds of which was offset by related reserve releases.","Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time.","And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio. About half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly a quarter was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was disbursed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration.","With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or in other words, credit costs of roughly $600 million in total for the first half.","Taking a step back and looking at the full-year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In fixed income, despite the volatile back drop our rates and currencies revenues grew 4% over the prior year with momentum in both local markets and G10 products.","Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015 generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year with revenues approaching our near term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter.","M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid to high single digit revenue growth across TTS, security services and the private bank.","So while we face certain industry wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continued to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015.","On slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower than anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter, as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014.","Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year due in part to gains on debt buybacks, and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.","Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than a third of this year end amount relating to operational risk.","As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and we'll continue to pursue other sales as well.","On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales, as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges, and other episodic items.","As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.","But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. We currently expect the benefits of lower funding costs, the exit of loss making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain.","As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the assets should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA.","On slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while City Holdings has continued to shrink.","Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated due mostly to trading net interest margin, and our net interest margin for the full-year was 293 basis points.","Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter.","We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016 and then it will reflect Costco in the second half.","On slide 17 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI, as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.","Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA.","And importantly within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1% and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share.","To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and a slow trajectory for US rate increases.","But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single digit revenue growth in Citicorp, while staying disciplined around our target client strategy.","We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses, as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity, and capture the benefits of scale.","However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise.","The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in US cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in A&R and branded cards, which as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016.","The completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition for which we are already ramping up operations, but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around mid year. And finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment.","Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near term drag on our results.","We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses combined with certain other actions will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year, before improving in 2017 and thereafter.","Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit costs to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015.","As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael Corbat","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a follow-up on credit. I think if you look at the last two quarters and then your guidance for the next two, it seems like you're adding, depending on what we assume for charge-offs $1.34 billion of reserves in the corporate book. It seems a little bigger than your peers.","Generally we've talked about your exposures to larger multinationals that you wouldn't expect to see this kind of stress. So if you could just walk us through what you're seeing in your portfolio, where the stress is, maybe more specifics? That would be helpful.","John Gerspach","Yes, thanks, Jim. As you can imagine, most of the stress that we're seeing obviously is in the energy portion of the portfolio. And the guidance that I gave you as far as the roughly $600 million worth of cost of credit in the first half of the year, that's really based on a scenario where oil prices remain at the - at least current levels when I walked into this meeting, of around $30 a barrel and staying there for a sustained period.","Beyond that, as the portfolio is in excellent shape and mirrors the overall strategy that we have. But obviously, there is some pressure in the energy related markets at this point in time.","Jim Mitchell","Well can you help us with any sense of what you view as the worst case if we stay at $30 a barrel for 18 months, 2 years, with how much more it might be beyond that?","John Gerspach","Well I'm not going to go into scenario-by-scenario. The scenario I've given you is what our cost would be with oil at $30 for a sustained period. And think of sustained period as being something over a year, okay.","If oil were to drop to say $25 a barrel and then stay there for a sustained period of time, then that first half cost of credit number that I gave you might double.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one other question on the balance sheet. I think outside the asset sales it came down pretty nicely. Is that just the environment or do you think is that real progress in shrinking the balance sheet?","And we saw one of your competitors lower their surcharge. Any update on that or the ability to shrink your surcharge?","John Gerspach","Yes, we've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce. One is we've wound down holdings and then as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients.","And as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got, I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in their non-operating deposits.","We came into the year with less than $100 billion of non-operating deposits and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of non-operating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of non-operating deposits because they're not there.","As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket.","However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers.","So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21% and as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%.","Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized such as our cross jurisdictional claims and liabilities. So I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks.","Michael Corbat","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","I know this is a tough one, but I want to see how you think about it. With the benefit of hindsight obviously, we look back in '08 and saw the hidden leverage, now see the hidden leverage related to a decline in housing, and obviously there was a lot of products in CDL land and things that lead to the destruction that we saw. This is not the same. There are not products like that.","However, curious to see how you think about the potential hidden leverage or maybe the follow on impacts in other sectors of the lower oil prices. So while I think you're doing a conservative job the way you described it in reserving for specific energy credits, I'm curious on how you even begin to stress and think about it across the rest of the portfolio?","John Gerspach","Yes, fair question, Glenn. And it's something that we look at constantly and we're always doing that. One of the reasons, we haven't seen any real knock on effects as yet broadly across the rest of the portfolio.","But frankly, if part of what I had commented on earlier, I mentioned that we had a $600 million reserve build, about half of that had to do with energy, and then of the other $300 million, roughly half of that is money that we've put away just for macro concerns.","Where we don't see specifics in portfolios, but we're trying to make sure that we've got something there because again, just as you, there may be knock on effects that appear later that just aren't there right now. And that's one of the reasons why we do things like put up macro reserves.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate that. And then there were specific declines in one of the slides, it showed, you showed in your appendix the specific declines in consumer credit receivables in both Korea, Brazil and I guess Russia.","But I'm just curious, are those specific actions you're taking to manage risk or is there pay down, charge off, just curious on those specific markets?","John Gerspach","Yes. Let's start with the last one that you mentioned. Russia, obviously as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years.","And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times.","But the portfolio in general has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's by and large a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble.","Doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it produces a very resilient book of business. So with Russia, it's a little bit of just - there's less business there. We are carefully managing credit lines and really nothing more than that.","With Brazil, there's certainly - that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil.","You'll recall that I mentioned the up-tick in Latin America NCLs in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that up-tick is related to some losses that we took in the CCB, in our commercial business and that is really centralized in Brazil and it's this portfolio.","We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases and again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil.","Michael Corbat","John, if I can chime in and you think about, Glenn, the countries that you mentioned interestingly, they fall into some different buckets. So you've heard us on this call for quite a while talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening branch closures, tighter target market in Korea.","In Russia's case there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs and the other come as an after of that. And so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans, your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink.","But at the same time as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending, just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies and as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see.","And in the case of Brazil, in some ways a combination of those, a restructuring of what's gone on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business which didn't fit, which in hindsight was a terrific sale, and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think its part of our natural credit and business process.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Well I appreciate it. And I guess that the bottom line is you're still able to grow international consumer a couple of percent a year right now. So I guess stay disciplined. Thank you.","Michael Corbat","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Gerspach","Hey, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","So could you give some color, obviously there's a lot of investor concern over emerging market health, maybe given your unique position allows you to comment on it. Could you give some color on what you've seen as far as spending trends and credit trends in Asia and LatAm?","Obviously John, you already weighed out very clearly that the majority of the up-tick in the credit losses was the wind down in Brazil. So we need to half that roughly at least. But maybe some additional color and some spending color might be helpful too?","John Gerspach","Yes, let me start. Again, when I mentioned earlier, I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit but we also saw a slight up-tick in Asia. You'll see that the up-tick got us from 79 bps to 84 bps. But it was there.","And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs. But most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China.","So its - but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices in particular are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there.","Now obviously if the economies go south due to the fact that and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today.","And as I had mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us.","So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy.","We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea.","And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia, that while it may dampen our revenue prospects from time-to-time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story.","And you think about Asia. Asia accounts for 70% of our total International Consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points.","And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of our originations are to borrowers that would be comparable to 700 plus FICO scores in the US. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher quality segments.","I mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%. And our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to zero.","So again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico is by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass market borrowers in Mexico, the credit story has really improved because we've again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years.","So again, pretty good. And spending patterns, you've seen the growth in purchase sales. It's still there. It's somewhat muted because of the overall economic environment, but it's still there.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Thanks for that, John. And then, switching over maybe to holdings. I know there's a lot of noise this quarter. But could you maybe set for us how we should think about now at this point from where we are, and I know it's a fluid situation because as you announced, you've still got several billion dollars of sales already inked here for 2016.","But what's the right way to think about the revenue and expense rate jumping off point from here in holdings?","John Gerspach","You know, it's a great question and I'm sure it frustrates you as you try to come up with how you want to model holdings out into the future. And the truth is holdings is somewhat - it just doesn't lend itself to a good model.","A lot of what goes through Holdings, as you can imagine, is episodic. There's just episodic numbers that hit whether we have a gain on sale. We move something into a held for sale.","When you look at the cost of credit line in holdings this quarter and it looks extremely high. And it's like wow, how come you had such a high cost of credit in holdings?","Well, we moved a couple of large, about $8 billion of loans into held for sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale I have to run through my loan loss reserve.","So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and moved them into held for sale.","So it's really tough. The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call, which is think in terms of holdings being marginally profitable on an EBT point of view in each quarter next year. That's really what we're striving for.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Hi, thank you.","John Gerspach","Hey, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Can you talk about the outlook for DTA consumption and maybe some of the levers to pull if there's continued headwinds either related to OCI or just macro environment impacts to the actual earnings?","John Gerspach","Yes, our look at holdings, if you take a look at DTA for the full year this year, consistent with what we've said, we got about $2.5 billion of DTA reduction out of our - out of our businesses. So our earnings consume $2.5 billion of the DTA.","And when we take a look at our DTA planning for a given year, we're focused first and foremost on what are we going to get out of the core businesses. So that was pretty good I thought.","And then, I can't do much to control OCI. But don't forget what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA. And so that will, you know, especially when you think about the impact on our available for sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just merely a timing difference.","The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that.","And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. Maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017.","But we also utilized a $0.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to - that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well.","And that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective, utilize FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near term expiration date.","The one thing that we never want to do is we never want to go into a year and have FTCs set to expire that year. So that's really how we think about DTA planning.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately, you mentioned about investing in high ROA businesses and obviously spent some time going through the US credit card effort. Are there other businesses that may not be as high in the pecking order or not represent as big of an investment that you had highlight?","I think there had been an article in one of the papers recently about the equities business. If that's one or if there's other areas that you had mentioned?","Michael Corbat","Yes. So Matt, you're right to call out equities. Equities is one of those places where we think we've got continued upside. We talked about wanting to get equities in that $800 million to $900 million per quarter range.","We got real close to that. We think we've got more we can do and so we're investing in there and people and research, electronic trading platforms and other things you've probably seen and read about.","Obviously our Treasury and Trade Solutions business, we think continues to be an area where we can continue to take share around our target clients. We think some of the disruptions amongst the European banks and other things out there, given people may have more balance sheet constraints than we do, that we can use our balance sheet smartly around some investments in parts of that business.","Our security services businesses, our private banks, private bank. A lot of the things where you've seen this year where we've had good growth but think there's more.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And lastly if I can squeeze in, you've obviously made a lot of progress, huge progress de-risking. A lot of progress refining the portfolio of businesses. You probably wouldn't tell us which ones they would be.","But is there another cut at looking at the geography, looking at the businesses, overlaying those and coming up with another handful of businesses or a handful of markets to reposition?","Michael Corbat","Yes. We've consistently talked about, we've got a methodology that we've applied consistently to our businesses around our invest to grow, optimize and grow, stay the course or restructure mentalities that we've applied towards businesses.","And what we've said is we need to see our businesses and our geographies on the right trajectory to be accretive to our company and to our shareholders. And we are constantly reviewing that and those buckets and businesses continue to evolve around capital and balance sheet efficiencies. And that's work I think in some ways that never ends.","So we've made progress. And as I said to our team, I'm pleased but not satisfied in terms of where we are and we've got more work to do.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","John Gerspach","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","A couple quick questions. One is on the outlook for capital excess capital and capital return. I don't think we spoke too much yet about that. And with the OneMain sale, could you speak to how much RWA you're able to move off and to the degree that you can speak to how much excess capital you think it generates that you could potentially ask for in the upcoming CCAR?","John Gerspach","Betsy, let me - this is John. Let me talk to OneMain and then Mike can talk to the capital distribution broadly. When you take a look at OneMain, we said it was about $9 billion worth of the GAAP assets.","But it was actually part therefore of the GAAP asset reduction that you saw in holdings. And in the same fashion, it was part of the roughly 30 billion - $23 billion worth of reduction in RWA that we had in holdings this quarter.","So overall Holdings came down 23, risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down $23 billion this quarter and OneMain was part of that.","So when you look, we've made continued progress in driving down holdings. We've made continued progress on the rest of the balance sheet as well and all of that leaves us to the 12% CET1 ratio that we have at the end of this year. And Mike\u2026","Michael Corbat","So Betsy, what we do know is we know our numbers, we know our ratios. You've seen our capital generating capacity net of approximately $6 billion capital return. We still generated 140 basis points of CE Tier 1 in the course of '15 and we think we continue to have significant capital generating power going forward.","So we feel like from where ratios are, we're coming into this year's exercise or this year's submission in a stronger place. We also know that we're going to be using - the industry is going to be using a Gen-4 balance sheet. We think that's for us a good balance sheet, but what we don't know is we don't know the scenarios.","And so we feel good about our drivers, but until we know the scenarios and how those impact us, it's tough to put any kind of number on that. But going back to what we've said before, we recognize our capital generating capacity and power and we've got to position the institution and affirm to continue to ramp up and more meaningfully be returning capital to our shareholders. Otherwise we're just going to be faced with a denominator problem.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, I appreciate that. And then just one clean up question on energy. Did you give a ratio of your energy reserves to your energy exposure and if you could split it between oil and gas and metals and mining, wondering if you have that handy?","John Gerspach","One, Betsy, I didn't give that ratio and I don't really intend to give that ratio. But obviously, we've taken what we think are the appropriate reserving actions for it. Metals and mining is actually outside of energy.","So metals and mining would not be specifically covered in any of the energy related comments that I gave. But consistent with the energy story, we've also taken a good look at the metals and mining.","Now don't forget, metals and mining we don't report that separately. Metals and mining is part of the larger sector that we report. But when you think about the metals and mining, our exposure overall to metals and mining is about $14 billion and that includes about $5.6 billion worth of funded loans.","And again, it's another portfolio that as you can imagine is run consistent with the overall strategy. So good investment grade rating. I think it's somewhere around over 70% in metals and mining. And there's nothing special to talk about from a reserving point of view in metals and mining this quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","John Gerspach","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Mike, can you share with us, obviously, you guys have a very strong capability of generating capital as you just explained. We don't know what the final capital ratios will be for our G-SIFIs.","But what buffer do you think you're comfortable with, maybe its 2 years from now. Again, we don't know what these final numbers will be. But how much are you going to carry in capital above whatever the final requirement is for you guys?","Michael Corbat","I think based on what we know today, we think a buffer is somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. That obviously could evolve over time, but I'd say based on what we know today, we think for a company with the construct of our balance sheet, risk profile, et cetera, that's probably the right range for now.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Thank you. And then, John, you mentioned in the Equities business, that you might be taking some market share from some of your competitors or potentials, particularly the European banks.","I saw on your slide 33 in the appendix how your local markets rates and currencies, you are doing well there. Are there any banks that you're seeing that you are able to take market share from in Europe or Asia?","Michael Corbat","Well, it's Mike, Gerard. We're not going to get specific but obviously around a number of those banks that there is questions in terms of strategy going forward. Oftentimes in those banks what you'll see is the binding constraint around leverage, and rates and currencies very often is one of the areas where leverage for obvious reasons causes some of the tougher challenges and where I think we've seen people pulling back balance sheet.","So again, around scale, around local presence, we've had the ability to take some of that share. And I think that the slide you call out on page 33 is a great illustration of one of our franchises that happens to sit in a trading business, but has tremendous stability to its revenue generating capacity and capabilities.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then you mentioned I think you're going to close 50 branches right off here, a bunch of them up in Boston. Can you guys talk to us about the success you've had in other areas where you've just shut branches down? But you talked about or touched upon the mobile channel.","How you're able to keep some of these customers because of mobile banking inroads that everybody is making. What kind of success are you seeing in keeping these customers where maybe you physically have left the market?","John Gerspach","Yes, I mean, again, and we've, as you know, exited a few markets across the country. And in general, we find that we're now able to retain slightly over 50% of the deposits from those customers even as we pull back on the branch banking in those areas.","That's one of the reasons why we're trying to make an even bigger push into digital or mobile banking. We think that that's more responsive to the way people are really going to access their bank in the future.","And so, we think that that gives us a lot of opportunity and it's something that we're spending money trying to improve our capabilities there.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just finally, I know John, you talked about the pretax contribution that your actions in Citi Holdings had in the quarter, about a $1.3 billion. What was the actual gain on the sale of OneMain? I don't think I heard you say. I don't know if you're going to disclose it.","John Gerspach","You've never heard me say it and we're not likely to disclose it. So it's in the results for holdings for the quarter. And again, we utilized a fair portion of that gain to buy back a high coupon debt that was supporting the rest of the holdings business.","So again, to us it's not whether or not we made a big gain on that. It's overall what's the cost of exiting everything that we've got in holdings.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Thank you, I appreciate it.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I think I heard the positive comments about 2015. You had an ROA of 94 basis points, an ROTCE of 9.2%, efficiency of 57% and your tangible book is up to $61. I don't think anybody cares today and that leads to my question.","John, you mentioned you're not seeing a knock on effect from what's taking place in China and commodities. At least not enough to change your reserve guidance more than you've already done.","But I just think it would be helpful to have some more data on the exposures in energy, in China and just perhaps Mike, a bigger picture perspective on what you think is taking place in the markets right now.","Michael Corbat","Sure. John, do you want to start on China and we can talk a little bit about and I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, is in some ways quite informative.","We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier and the diversifications there and the mix between North America and International. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to page 30 and actually look at the balance, look at the balance of our portfolios, the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition.","And so, when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM. We're actually over a third of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short term nature, they are largely to multinationals and the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized.","So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all of the disclosure and GIPS [ph] $1 of loan can take on or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings.","And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in corporate lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality of that books looks like.","37% or $42 billion of that is in short term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go\u2026","John Gerspach","Again Mike, to close out on Mike's thought. When we take a look - the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world.","And it's focused on those large multinationals and some very top tier large local corporate\u2019s. And the overall portfolio has got - it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio.","You mentioned China though, so let me - you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do Mike in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we put that - it's on page 91 of our September 30 10-Q and we'll update that when we file our 10-K.","And if you take a look at page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities.","And you'll see that as of September 30th, those two amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we update this page in the 10-K.","When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia.","Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high quality mortgage portfolio. Now the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia in aggregate has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus.","That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans, same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700, and very good loss performance. Then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here this portfolio has been broadly stable.","So that leaves me with the last category that we give you which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion. And the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio, as Mike talked about, the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China, more than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans which are generally short term secured financings or they are in the private bank.","So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional corporate lending book and over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state owned Chinese companies.","So as you would expect with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade.","Mike Mayo","Well that's helpful. Can we move to energy though? I don't want you being the only bank not disclosing reserves to energy, oil and gas loans. I mean, I think most others have disclosed that who have reported so far.","And I mean, your stocks down 7%, the whole market is down a whole lot. But even if it's a low number it can't hurt too much more from here. So how much in oil and gas loans do you have and what are the reserves taken against that? I know you were asked this already but I'm going back for a second try?","John Gerspach","When you take a look at the overall portfolio Mike, we've reduced the amount of exposure. Our funded exposure to energy related companies this quarter is down 4%. It's about $20.5 billion. The overall exposure also came down about 4%. The overall exposure now is about $58 billion and that includes unfunded.","When you take a look at the composition of the funded portfolio, about 68% of that portfolio would be investment grade. That's up from the 65% that we would have had at the end of the third quarter. And the unfunded book is about 87% investment grade.","So while we are taking what we believe to be the appropriate reserves for that, but I'm just not prepared to give you a specific number right now as far as the amount of reserves that we have on that particular book of business. It's just not something that we've traditionally done in the past.","Mike Mayo","Well, if I can just test your conviction. You gave guidance of $600 million in loan loss provisions for ICG for the first half of the year, and so that would be half the run rate from the fourth quarter.","So something - I guess you're feeling pretty positive contrast to the market about those expectations, unless if oil goes to $20 as you said before. What's your level of confidence in that guidance?","John Gerspach","That level - I feel very confident at that level of guidance with oil at $30 a barrel. And I feel very confident about the additional guidance that I gave you should oil fall to $25 a barrel.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow up and maybe this is back to you, Mike. One theory that was put out there is that we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity, not due to Citigroup, not due to the banks. But you have a lot of bought investors that have been burnt, whether it's junk bond or private equity or liquidity funds.","And to the extent that liquidity dries up, you could have pressure on some of your borrowers even though it's not due to you. Do you think we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity or are you seeing any evidence of that?","Michael Corbat","I think Mike, that liquidity today I would break into strata by credit segments. And I think you've seen that the bond markets throughout this, big financing done the other day, almost record setting financing in the investment grade space. So I think around investment grade credits the market's open. It will have its ups and downs but those windows will continue to largely stay open.","I think as you go down the credit spectrum and on the back of Fed, on the back of uncertainties and unevenness in the world, I think you're going to see lower segments of the credit spectrum continuing to be challenged. And that will certainly be challenged in various forms of liquidity and most notably, illiquidity in some of those instruments.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Michael Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good afternoon. Just one question, John, I believe you were talking about the still seeing that ability to grow Corp revenues this year. And I'm presuming you're talking constant dollar basis.","So I was just wondering, obviously, a lot of uncertainties that we can caveat. But as it stands now, how much do you expect rates to inform that growth and how would you break the growth potential between NII and the fee side?","John Gerspach","Well let me try to answer that in a couple different ways. One, again we're talking about low single digits and that's somewhat consistent with what we have here. There's not a heavy rate component in that guidance of 3% revenue growth.","So we've had about, we certainly have had the first 25 basis point increase and that's good and we're counting on that and that's performing pretty much the way that we would have expected as far as the impact on our businesses.","We've got a modest level of rate increases built into the tail end of the year, maybe a rate increase somewhere towards the middle of the year and one right at the very end of the year.","So again, there's not a heavy increase in rate element of that low single digit number, equivalent to effect the - we had 3% this year, we'll see what low single-digits will look like next year.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then one question on balance sheet size, still things coming out of averages after the sales this quarter, the pending sales going forward. Do you have some type of view on where average earning assets balances out, where the kind of settle out point is after you've worked through the last part or the lingering parts of what you're planning on getting rid of?","John Gerspach","You mean for the overall - for holdings or the overall firm, I just\u2026","Ken Usdin","I was thinking more overall firm because I'd presume that holdings kind of just dwindles back to the point where at some point you put it back into the overall firm. But I'm thinking more just big picture top of the house?","John Gerspach","Yes, from a top of the house, I think what you've seen is that we adjust the size of our balance sheet based upon the opportunity that we see, and more importantly, the needs that our clients have. And so neither Mike or I have ever put an absolute cap that says we will not grow the balance sheet.","Where we see that our clients have needs and we can provide solutions, we're more than happy to put our balance sheet at work. It's one of the advantages that we have given the capital level that we have and more importantly, given the supplemental leverage ratio that we have, and given the LCR that we are currently running at, which is at 112%.","So we do think that we've got a lot of capacity to put to work if and when we get faced with client need.","Ken Usdin","Right, okay. So we'll see a little bit of push up but you're not necessarily seeing a major shrinkage and you'd give yourself room for it to grow again, you're not capped out?","John Gerspach","No, but what you will consider, continue to see us do is try to make our balance sheet ever more efficient. And that means running off the low ROA assets and trying to gather more of the high ROA assets.","That's the exact theory behind and the plan behind the investments that we're currently making in the US branded cards book.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, a question for you on the Asia regional consumer and sort of your outlook there for operating leverage improvement. It looks like on a year-over-year basis you were able to generate some operating leverage with revenues down a little bit less than costs.","But I guess, I'm curious, given your comments about continued challenges on the regulatory front and the potential for slowdown in many of those economies, what's your thinking about potential operating leverage within the Asia consumer business in 2016?","John Gerspach","Yes. I'd prefer, I mean, Asia and Latin America are going to be interesting next year and from a revenue perspective they both kind of have the same story which is more of revenue stabilizing in the first half of the year.","And then as volumes grow during the balance of the year, we'll begin to see then a sequential growth in revenue, which will get us then to year-over-year revenue growth in the latter part of 2016.","And when I think about the expense story, again, I'm trying to manage, we're trying to manage the two together. And so from an international, overall international consumer point of view, I'd expect as we continue to make investments in selected growth investments, whether its technology or I mentioned digital and infrastructure, I'd say that we're going to pace the revenues against the revenue growth. And for the international GCB overall, we would look to return then to positive operating leverage in the latter half of the year.","Matt Burnell","Okay. So it sounds like that guidance really hasn't changed very much?","John Gerspach","No.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just back stateside, given your strong capital levels and where you sit relative to your minimum requirements. I guess, I'm just curious if you're thinking even more aggressively about potentially using some of that capital to focus on non-organic growth in some of your US businesses as a way of accelerating use of the DTA?","Michael Corbat","You know Matt, what we've said there is that we don't and will not look at transactions and rationalize the transaction or a purchase around DTA utilization. DTA utilization is the benefit that comes out of good transactions and that was the case in Best Buy, we believe that's the case in Costco.","And we're wide open as John said we've got the resource balance sheet capital capability around things that are accretive to our firm to step into large situations and we're open to that.","Unfortunately in this environment there's not a lot of those out there, but we'll continue to look. And again, staying true to our strategy, staying true to our target client base, if those opportunities present themselves, we'll try and take advantage of it.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Fair enough. And finally, an administrative question. John, you'd mentioned in the past when holdings was a much bigger portion of the overall balance sheet that maybe at around 5% of assets you would think about folding holdings back into at least the reporting of the company. How are you thinking about that now that you're at about 4%?","John Gerspach","Yes, and actually we've had conversations like that. The question always becomes where would we put it? And I don't want to take the assets that are in holdings and simply put them back into the businesses quote, from whence they came. Otherwise we would spend the entire call with you explaining how much of anything that happened was related to legacy assets.","The alternate construct would be just to take and put it all into Corp\/Other, but I almost get to the same point where I'd think then you'd all want to have more detail as far as what is in Corp\/Other related to those legacy assets.","So it's still something that Mike and I talk about all the time and at some point we will likely collapse it into say Corporate\/Other. But it's probably still just a little bit too big to put into Corporate\/Other just to avoid basically splitting it all out again just so that you guys will have a clearer picture of it.","So it's a bit annoying to have it out there as something separate, but we're not ready to combine it yet with Corp\/Other.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, thanks. A quick question on the Costco. Was it right that you said it was expecting, the portfolio acquisition was expected to close late in the second quarter?","John Gerspach","Yes, we said later in the second quarter.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, is there any risk though that since it's an April 1 cutoff for the contract that you've started the contract without actually acquiring the portfolio? And why did it get pushed back past the contract date?","John Gerspach","No, as you can imagine, we're involved in a rather intense discussion with both the current owner of the portfolio as well as Costco. And as we have gone down trying to figure out what is the best way to affect the handover.","What we determined in running down this process is that a date where we can get a concurrent closing of the portfolio as well as then a conversion of all of the operations is probably the simplest and most efficient solution for everybody. And it's probably the best way to ensure a seamless customer experience as well.","So then as we looked at various dates, something in June just seemed to work best as far as a date that we could point to when we could not only transfer the portfolio, but then also make sure that there's a nice clean hand off of all the operational aspects of the portfolio as well.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then just a second question. I know you laid out the macro conditions and how they are deteriorating somewhat across the globe, but I mean, doesn't that argue for a period of belt tightening as opposed to renewed investment?","I know there's attractive opportunities you're saying, but I mean, isn't there other places that should be cutting as well at the same time on expenses?","Michael Corbat","Well, as you look around the globe, we're forecasting somewhere, depending how you build China into the forecast, somewhere GDP growth, somewhere between 2.5 and 2.8. 2% out of developed markets, 4% out of developing markets. And if you look at the US, the US has a candidly, a pretty good feel to it. And so, I wouldn't argue to belt tightening there.","If we look at what's going on in Europe and we talked about what we see, not just some of the absolute, but some of the relative opportunities there, that feels pretty good. And then you start to look at pieces and parts of the rest of the franchise. A lot of these franchises on the ground are TTS franchises and different parts and pieces there.","So we're going to continue to be very mindful. You've seen us, we talked about the overall headcount reduction which is net of significant investment into controls and we're going to continue to be mindful and to make sure that we are scaling and sizing our company to what we think the opportunities are.","And I think that we've shown we haven't been afraid at the right times to make the investments and we haven't been afraid at the tougher times to pull things back, and I think that will be the case in '16.","John Gerspach","And don't forget, I mean, with the investments that we're planning, our guidance is that we intend to hold the operating efficiency ratio constant with this year. So therefore, our goal is to fund those investments through additional operational efficiencies.","As I mentioned, we're constantly looking to make the place more efficient and adjust the capacity level. So all of that will continue and all we're saying is that we're going to use those savings to fund these investment programs which we think are beneficial for the future.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes, hi. I just wanted to slip one quick question in as a follow-up to Betsy's question on CCAR. Mike, we appreciate that you're coming into this year's CCAR with strong ratios and of course, we don't have the parameters yet.","You've always talked about the progress on the qualitative side as just that, progress. And I'm wondering if you're satisfied enough with your progress in terms of your qualitative report card to feel confident about a step up in ASK [ph] this year?","Michael Corbat","Again, I think the ASK, there's a couple components there because you layout to the ASK. And one is what do your numbers tell you and second is, how do you feel from your process? We have continued [Technical Difficulty]really ever gets to an end state, we'll see.","But I feel better today than I felt a year ago given our investments about where we are qualitatively and I hope I feel better a year from today than I feel today around that. So long winded answer of saying feel better about where we are qualitatively, but more work to do.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Good afternoon.","John Gerspach","Hi, Steven.","Steven Chubak","So I have actually a follow-up to Erica's question. Just thinking about the upcoming CCAR submission, recognizing it's still early days. But within the submission itself, Mike, you mentioned that you like how the fourth quarter balance sheet looks, but does Costco and the additional receivables have to be contemplated as part of your submission?","John Gerspach","Steven, we'll assume in CCAR that we go ahead with the Costco acquisition. We think that that is responsive to the rules as they currently exist. But again, the acquisition date will be somewhat later in June.","And so we'll have to see what stress tests look like as far as what the condition of the portfolio would be in when we acquire it in June.","Steven Chubak","Understood. And just switching over to the risk-weighted asset size within capital. I appreciate a lot of the guidance that you've given in terms of the holdings trajectory and the reduction that we're expecting on the coming year.","But it appears as though that benefit is now going to be exhausted or largely exhausted in terms of RWA shrinkage and yet you're going to be continuing to grow Citicorp on a core basis.","And just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the RWA trajectory for 2016 given all of those moving parts?","John Gerspach","Yes, we rarely give guidance on the RWA. But again, there is several things that would go on there. One, as you mentioned, we will continue to wind down holdings and we will continue to get some benefit there.","Currently, we would look to see that, that should more or less give us some ability then to manage growth in the rest of Citicorp with the exception of course of the addition of the Costco portfolio.","But then you've got on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet. So I think you might see some increase in RWA coming into 2016, but I wouldn't guide you to some huge amount of growth.","Steven Chubak","Understood. And just given the market risk proposal that came out and recognizing you've only had a mere 24 hours to digest the release from BASEL. But do you have any preliminary expectations or takeaways from what came out yesterday, and what's a reasonable expectation for even a range of potential market risk inflation?","John Gerspach","My initial impression, not that I have gone through the whole thing, but from people that I've spoken to here that actually have begun to go through it, is that they still need to do a lot more work. And so we will continue to try to pass appropriate commentary on to the right parties to see that that work is done.","But if you take a look don't forget, our risk-weighted assets coming out of market risk currently are $77 billion. It's roughly 6% of the total RWA. So while this proposal could have a significant impact on our market risk RWA, you've got to gauge it in the fact that we're talking about 6% of our total RWA.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And then just one ticky tack question on the NIM guidance. John, you mentioned that any rate benefit, which sounds like it'll be relatively modest that's contemplated within the guidance for '16, is going to be offset by a reduction in trading NII.","I just wanted to get a sense as to what's driving that? Is it a function of lower inventory levels, issuance tied to TLAC or is it something else?","John Gerspach","No, trading NIM is something that is largely variable, and only because you - the composition of your portfolios change constantly. And so this year, I would just say that we've had a larger than expected contribution to NIM coming off the trading book than we would have experienced in years past. And I haven't gotten yet to the point where I'm comfortable saying that that's the new norm.","And so, if trading NIM reverts back closer to where it was in the past, then it could offset some of the - all or some of the benefit that we expect to get out of rates. But you know, I'll certainly have more to talk to you about as we get further into '16 and we see whether or not we've actually got the trading NIM really working consistently at this point in time.","Steven Chubak","Thanks for clarifying that, John. And appreciate you taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Hey, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, how are you? Mike, I just want to bring together some of your comments to make sure I understand sort of the strategic imperatives as it comes to a lot of the repositioning that's occurred.","So on the four quadrant slide that you first introduced that seems to still describe your approach. Is the bar getting higher for the businesses that are in the upper left hand quadrant or is that more or less a static standard?","Michael Corbat","I would say at the time we introduced that, we also - at the time we introduced that firm wide was also coincided with it at the point in time we put our targets in place. So I would say that those have largely been the same or consistent over the 3 years.","Clearly, leverage has been introduced, supplemental leverage has been introduced since then. There's been the evolution of CCAR and CCAR returns. And so today, I would say that actually we're looking at it in some ways consistently, but in other ways with the additional view of some of the lenses I just mentioned.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And is anything that's going on in the broader macro economy causing some business lines or geographies to fall out of that segment and into the lower right segment?","Michael Corbat","No, I would say not right now. You'll get some things that have some aberration. So an example I would give you is we have in parts of our cards portfolio, we've got gasoline cards.","So simply spend on gasoline cards have come down by a third when volumes are the same. And so you're not necessarily going to take a short-term view and say that gee, gas cards is a bad business. It may not be what we wanted at this point of the cycle or at this inflection point in oil prices.","But again, in here, we're not taking short-term views around these. So I would say at this point not.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And John, one quick balance sheet question. You talked about the debt buyback as a consequence of the OneMain sale and the fact that you have so little non-operational deposits left.","At this stage, is there any real balance sheet optimization opportunity left to you or have those been largely exhausted?","John Gerspach","Well, I'd say there's always some opportunity. I mean, obviously, we've taken a good chunk of the opportunity so far and become more and more efficient. But there's still ways of optimizing the balance sheet.","So not necessarily making it more efficient by making it smaller, but there's still elements of balance sheet optimization such as shifting more of the balance sheet towards those higher ROA businesses.","So I'd say that maybe the word going forward will be optimization rather than making it more efficient. But in anyway it's still targeting our focus on improving the overall ROA.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. Excellent. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time.","Susan Kendall","Great. Thank you, Brent, and thank you all for spending the time with us today. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5537":["Citigroup Inc.

Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Lynn, you may begin your conference.","Elizabeth Lynn","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn you over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.9 billion for the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $2.07 were 20% higher than a year ago. Our return on tangible common equity was 12.2%, bringing our year-to-date return to 12%, which remains our target for the year.","We also had loan and deposit growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. We, again, saw a balanced underlying growth in Global Consumer Banking with a 4% increase in revenues, and EBIT growth of 17%.","In North America, growth in our branded cards business accelerated to 11% from last year. Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand and scale in credit cards to drive deeper, multiproduct relationships with our clients.","Internationally, EBIT was up 26%, excluding the gain on sale last year. In Mexico, we continue to manage through a slower growth environment through expense and credit discipline. In Asia, investor sentiment continued to improve, resulting in higher Wealth Management revenues.","Our institutional clients group also had balanced performance with solid results in both the market-sensitive and accrual-type businesses. Our share gains continued at Investment Banking, while our Markets performance showed resilience due to strong client engagement. The backbone of our global network, Treasury & Trade Solutions, had strong revenue growth of 7% in constant dollars, while the Private Bank grew as well.","In addition to achieving stronger business performance, we remain focused on improving the returns we deliver to our shareholders through our capital planning. Consistent with the commitment we made in 2017, we remain on pace to return over $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over a three-year period, which ends next year. The plan includes significant buybacks, which have lowered our common shares outstanding by 259 million shares or 11% in the last year alone. Combined with 6% growth in net income, they've helped drive our tangible book value per share up 12%.","For now, we're focused on closing out the year and planning for 2020. The environment is highly unpredictable given how much of it is at the mercy of political machinations, whether it's trade negotiations or even the elusive resolution on Brexit. We'll keep our -- we'll help keep our clients -- we will help our clients navigate these choppy waters while also being flexible and adaptable when it comes to our own resource allocation.","Despite it all, we remain committed to investing in the products in which we see the best growth opportunities as well as in our own infrastructure for the purpose of safety and soundness. We have the leading global network and we're going to maximize our competitive advantages.","I'll now turn it over to Mark and then we'd be happy to take your questions.","Mark Mason","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year, consistent with our capital plan. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses.","Expenses increased 1% year-over-year as volume growth, along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%, better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items. The discrete tax items equate to a benefit of $0.10 per share this quarter. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been roughly 22%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $692 billion, as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets and deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.","Looking at year-to-date results on slide 4. Revenues were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico. Overall, consumer revenues have grown 4%, roughly in line with our medium-term expectations.","On the institutional side, revenues are up 2% year-to-date with continued growth in our accrual businesses. Expenses declined 1% year-to-date even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by 4%. EPS grew 17%, and we generated an RoTCE of 12%, in line with our expectations for the full year.","Turning now to the businesses. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The consumer business showed continued momentum in the third quarter. Excluding the gain last year, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. And looking at year-to-date results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pretax earnings.","Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail. Third quarter revenues of $5.4 billion were up 4% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to make progress towards a more integrated client-centric relationship model. Our deposit momentum continued to improve.","Year-to-date total net deposit inflows more than tripled compared with last year with strength across both traditional and digital channels. We've seen accelerating growth in deposits raised through digital channels. We generated nearly $2 billion in digital deposit sales in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to over $4 billion.","Consistent with our strategy to drive towards national scale in retail, nearly two-thirds of these deposit sales were outside of our existing branch footprint. And of this amount, roughly half were with card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us.","Our experience to date gives us confidence in our digital capabilities and engagement model, and provides a solid foundation for deepening of these relationships over time. And while most of the products we've introduced so far have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs, you'll see us expand into more partner programs as we move forward.","Turning now to the results of the individual businesses. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 2% year-over-year, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposit growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. And looking at average deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew customer balances by 5%.","Turning to Branded Cards. Revenues of $2.3 billion grew 11% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong, with purchase sales up 7% and average loan growth improved to 3%. We continued to generate higher growth in interest earning balances this quarter, up 9%. This growth in interest-earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans to 914 basis points this quarter.","Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 1% driven by organic loan growth. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.","Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services were 312 basis points and 477 basis points, respectively, this quarter, consistently with our full year guidance.","On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Third quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%, excluding the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. On this basis, Latin America Consumer revenues grew 3%. Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.","Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 5% in the third quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 9% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.","In total, operating expenses were largely unchanged in the third quarter as efficiency savings offset investment spending and volume-driven growth. And cost of credit was down 12%, reflecting a modest LLR release relative to a build in the prior year.","Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in fixed income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets and corporate lending.","Total banking revenues of $5 billion were up 3%. Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars, as we continued to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression.","We would expect the underlying business drivers to continue to perform well in TTS, given our unique global footprint and ability to deliver integrated solutions to our multinational clients despite continued uncertainty around the macro environment.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA. Private Bank revenues of $867 million were up 2% driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression. And Corporate Lending revenues of $527 million were down 6% reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging costs.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 1% from last year. Fixed Income revenues were roughly flat, although we did see better activity with both corporate and investor clients, as well as a solid quarter in rates and currencies particularly in G10 rates.","Equity's revenues were down 4%, primarily reflecting lower client activity and lower balances in prime brokerage, partially offset by strong client activity in derivatives. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars, reflecting higher volumes from new and existing clients.","Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings. And credit quality remains strong, consistent with our target client strategy. Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in Equity Markets' revenues.","Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $402 million declined 18% from last year, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses increased 6%, reflecting higher infrastructure costs, partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets. And the pretax loss was $68 million this quarter in line with our outlook. Looking ahead, we would expect a pretax loss in the range of $100 million to $150 million in Corporate\/Other for the fourth quarter as we continued to invest in infrastructure and controls.","Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue. Split between our Markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding Markets on the top of the slide. As you can see, year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-Markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.","Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower Markets' net interest revenue. And net interest margin declined 11 basis points sequentially, also driven by the lower Markets' net interest revenue. However, it is important to note that the decline in Markets' net interest revenue is almost fully offset by higher noninterest revenue in Markets this quarter shown at the bottom of this slide.","And turning to total noninterest revenue for total Citigroup, this quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth in noninterest revenue of roughly $350 million, driven by growth across the franchise, including higher Markets' noninterest revenue even as we faced the headwind of the $250 million gain last year, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver better growth next quarter in noninterest revenue.","So, while we did see pressure in net interest revenues, driven by the dynamic seen this quarter in Markets, which could continue into the fourth quarter, in total for Citigroup, we remain comfortable in our ability to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, driven by net interest revenue growth of 2% to 3% in constant dollars for the full year below our original forecast, given the dynamic I just mentioned in Markets, but offset by higher noninterest revenue, which should be better than our original forecast of at least flat to 2018 on a full year basis. So again, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we still expect to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, but the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated.","On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 12% year-over-year to $69.03, driven by net income and the lower share count. And our CET1 ratio declined sequentially to 11.6% as net income was offset by $6.3 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends along with an increase in risk weighted assets.","Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but we are not anticipating a repeat of the challenging trading environment seen in the fourth quarter of last year. And in our accrual businesses, revenues should benefit from continued strong client engagement and higher volumes.","However, we would expect this to be somewhat offset by spread compression given the lower interest rate environment. In consumer, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in all regions, driven by continued loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads.","For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially, cost of credit should continue to grow modestly, and importantly we expect solid pre-tax earnings growth year-over-year. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, absent any discrete tax items.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Glenn Schorr","I wonder if I could just get a follow-up on Branded Cards, the 11% growth in the quarter. Can you talk about -- or give us a breakdown of where that's being derived, what you're doing to incent that growth? I think I heard your comment about where part of the relationship is coming in, and how you're growing in the bank on non-bank customers through the card portfolio, but just focus specifically around the 11% growth in Branded Cards, talk about balance transfer and how the box you're writing to? Thank you. Sorry about that jumbled question.","Mark Mason","That's okay. Thank you. So I guess what I would point you on Branded Cards is a couple of things. One, we're seeing, as we've mentioned on a number of quarters now, the conversion from promotional-type offerings that we've made and balances to average interest earning balances. And so this is a continuation of customers that we have that we brought on a couple of years ago through promotional offerings who weren't paying any interest to now converting to interest earning balances. And that's fueling part of the growth.","You'll see purchase sales are up 7% in the quarter. You'll see the loan volumes are up as well. And so we're getting continued use of the card, top of wallet use, as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest earning balances for us.","And that should -- that's been the case for the past number of quarters. We'd expect that to continue to play out in the fourth quarter and continue to get some spread benefits. But likely going forward well into 2020, the benefits will continue to play out from a volume point of view. So volume growth will continue to be an important factor as well.","Glenn Schorr","And what you're doing on the promotional balances offers? I've just noted some long 21-month type offers out there. I just don't know if that's a growing percentage of the book or just tweaking at the margin?","Mark Mason","We've now -- we've kind of reached the mix, our desired mix of promotional balances that we're looking to have in the portfolio. Now what you would imagine is once you strike that balance between promotional and the interest earnings, you've got to maintain that balance, which means we'll continue to do promotional offerings going forward at the pace we've been running at in order to maintain that mix. And as those promotional balances mature, they ultimately convert into interest earning. And so they fuel kind of a go-forward growth and they're important parts of -- or I'd say important part of our investment strategy as we execute on the Branded Cards strategy.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. And then maybe a last follow-up on that, the flip side of that is, I know, that desire to deepen existing card relationships and convert card customers that don't have other banking relationships with you. What exactly are you doing to penetrate that? It sounds like it's starting to work.","Mark Mason","Yes. So, it is starting to work. I think I referenced earlier the growth in digital deposit sales and referenced that. In fact, a good portion of that is coming from card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us. We are, yeah, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open-up a retail banking account with us.","So for example, we know which of our card customers enjoy and prefer our ThankYou rewards programs and which of our card customers respond to many of the other programs that we offer from a rewards point of view. And so we're able to create packages for them that reward them with benefits they respond to like ThankYou points, if they're willing to open a retail banking account with us digitally, and clients are responding. And so our ability to mine that data, to create value propositions around things that our clients are motivated to has \u2013 or motivated with has resulted in the growth that we're speaking to now.","Mike Corbat","And I think the other piece of that, Glenn, is so far we have done that exclusively with our own proprietary products. But in the not-too-distant future, we'll be rolling that out to some of our co-brand as well as some of our retail partners. So I think we've got the ability to continue to expand on that.","Mark Mason","Yes.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks so much.","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the RoTCE targets. Mark, just want to confirm, for 2019, still feeling good about 12% or a darn close to 12% for this year given your fourth quarter outlook. And then for next year, obviously for both of you, the environments gotten tougher we all know that and 13.5%, your prior target for RoTCE, feels ambitious in this environment. Mark, you acknowledged that at the Barclays conference. But how are you guys going to think about it as you go through your planning? And what's the target for kind of 2020 as your balance wanting to show improvement on RoTCE versus what might be a more difficult environment?","Mark Mason","Sure. So, first thing, your first point, John, the 12% remains our target. As you pointed out, we are \u2013 we did 12.2% RoTCE this quarter, and we're at 12% year-to-date. And so that remains the target, and we feel as though we'll get to that number or darn close, as I've said now and you've said as well. In terms of the 13.5% for 2020, I've said it at the Barclays, and I'll say it again and Mike alluded to it. It's a very different environment than I think we expected kind of coming into the year.","There's a fair amount of uncertainty that remains. 13.5% remains the target, but we are now in the midst of our budgeting process. And we need to factor in the uncertainty that's in the environment, what that's likely to look like, or how that's likely to play out, what the impact \u2013 the full year impact in 2020 of the rate reductions might be, what we think client demand is going to look like. And there are puts and takes there in parts of the business.","There'll be pressure from some of these uncertainty and parts of the business like Markets, there could be some positives as we see volatility persist. And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that top line is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress, and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets.","Mike Corbat","And I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that I very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things. Not just \u2013 I think as you probably heard more broadly this morning in terms of the U.S., but when you globally look at the consumer, consumer's in fine shape. We saw the IMF come out this morning and revise growth downward. I would describe that probably more as a catch-up to where many of us have been than necessarily any new information, i.e. 3% global growth. So not as high as we'd like it to be, but 3% global growth is still growth.","And so I think a lot of it really depends of how our clients see themselves positioning in terms of CapEx, in terms of investment spend, in terms of hiring. And I don't think we want to be premature in any way in either direction of reading too much into that. And so we want to get our businesses in a room. We want to continue to gain information from our clients, not just here in the U.S., but around the world in terms of how they're thinking about things.","And I think as the past several years have shown, last year is a great example. The closer we can get to the year as opposed to kind of prejudging this early before we declare anything, I think, the better and more informed we'll be able to come back.","John McDonald","And I guess just to push you guys a little bit. The absolute level of RoTCE is quite a bit below peers. And I think, what most people would think, your franchise should be able to do on paper. With that in mind, even in this environment, Mike, do you hope to push to do better than you do in 2019? Like is that as a -- as a goal that you think is definitely reachable to do better next year than this year?","Mike Corbat","Absolutely. I think we've got to continue to show progress and we've got to continue to narrow that gap.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning guys. Just maybe first on ICG a little bit. I was a little surprised; expenses were up quarter-over-quarter, despite revenues being down. It was -- I know you had taken some severance in the first quarter, and I thought the messaging was that you'd start to see those expenses come out in the back half of the year. Was it just volume; was it investment or any other severance in there? How do we think about the trajectory in ICG expenses?","Mark Mason","Sure. So yes, the expenses were up 4%. There are investments that we're making in the ICG, particularly in our TTS business and how we improve the client experience and deepen some of those client relationships and those investments obviously are critically important.","There are some volume-driven growth tied to it, largely around transactional expenses. And then there are some compensation costs as well. So there's the higher performance from a base compensation point of view. There's some strategic hires that we've made in parts of the franchise.","And then lastly and you alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter as well, as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets, and as we've thought about kind of the long-term -- or longer-term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments. And those capacity adjustments obviously come with a cost. And so that is part of the -- what you see in the quarter as well in that 4% increase.","Jim Mitchell","So you feel that even in a lower growth, that negative growth, lower growth environment, you can still get the operating leverage over the intermediate term?","Mark Mason","So we think we -- look, I mean obviously in adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020. What will matter obviously is the topline and how wallets continue to evolve and how much share we're able to continue to capture. But we think we will continue to be able to run the business efficiently and perform accordingly.","Jim Mitchell","Right, fair enough. And then maybe just on deposits. Really strong growth on a period end basis particularly on ICG. Is that sort of end of quarter balance sheet positioning by some of your clients and that's rolling off? Or do you think that's sort of some sustainable growth? And if so, what's driving that?","Mark Mason","We actually -- you're right. We did see strong growth in deposits across the board in TTS specifically as well. It's across all regions in TTS. Frankly, it's with both new and existing clients. The majority of the deposit growth consisted of operating deposits, which is good.","And frankly, about a 1\/4 of the growth in operating deposits were from new or renewed clients. And so we're actively engaged with our clients. We're seeing opportunities to roll out our broad solution with them and we think that is likely to continue.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Mike Corbat","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo","First, look, you're running revenues faster than expenses. This was the 12th quarter in a row that you didn't call it out that what I think, I estimate you made it year-over-year by one-fifth of 1% of revenues, revenues grew faster than expenses. So you made it. But -- so the question is, growing revenue's faster than expenses, when you look back a bit ago, you were kind of doing it by like a touchdown or 2. And then it went down to a couple of field goals. Now it seems like you're exceeding it by an extra point to push the analogy. So the question is, how confident are you to continue that strength of revenues growing faster than expenses year-over-year? And what is the role of technology in helping you do so?","Mark Mason","I'll take the first one?","Mike Corbat","Yeah, okay.","Mark Mason","So look, you're right, we have reflected positive operating margin. We expect that to continue for the full year of 2019. And as we've talked about when we described both 2019 and 2020, we've talked about plus or minus GDP growth on the top line, roughly flat expenses. And we expect to deliver that for 2019. So yes, positive operating leverage and operating margin is what we're expecting to deliver. Mike, you want to take the technology?","Mike Corbat","Sure. Well, I think there's a couple of pieces I'd add to it. So one here, Mike, I think is if you go and you look at the numbers, I would say, relatively, quietly, as Mark alluded to over the past year, our head count was down by about 7,000, so somewhere between 3% and 4%. That has been almost exclusively focused on capacity at the front end. It hasn't really been focused or aimed at infrastructure.","And so when we came into the year, what we told you was we would be going at every lever and looking at all the things that we could do. And I think this year, we've done that. I think clearly, technology, when you go back to slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think, very nicely in the right direction. And those continue to give us that only cost benefits, but as or more importantly, service benefits in terms of the reactions to those.","So, I'm guessing, Mike, that given what's out there, that 2020 will continue to be a year where everything's on the table. We're going to kind of look at the multitude of those levers and we're going to kind of pull at those as we see fit, but at the same time not sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages in the U.S. and around the world.","Mark Mason","The only thing I'd add to that is -- so if you think about technology and its benefits and how they manifest themselves, one, as it relates to the offerings that we're able to create for our clients, so our ability to create solutions around our clients' problems. You think about TTS as a good example. And as we deal with clients, and for example, they tried to match invoices with payments, we've been able to use technology in partnership with companies like HighRadius to create capabilities surround that. So technology helps with our offerings.","Technology helps with the client experience, as Mike suggested in terms of the lower costs to serve, but also improving the way and the experience that our clients have with us. And then finally, technology helps with the efficiency of how we run our operations. So expanding our cloud infrastructure, removing legacy data centers and physical service, using automation, for example. So a number of different buckets are impacted by the technology spend that we make, and we'll continue to make that spend in light of those benefits.","Mike Mayo","And then just one follow-up, as it relates to -- and I know John asked the question about your RoTCE target. I mean, I guess I'll ask -- I'll make it easier and harder for you. I guess, the easier thing is look, under you, Mike Corbat, the RoTCE really has gone up quite a bit, 7%, 8%, up to 12% over a few years. So that's tremendous progress, but you still lag peers. And I don't think consensus expects you to get your 13.5% target. I think you're kind of -- what I'm hearing you say today is everything's on the table, but let's look at it in light of the new environment. So assume it might not be 13.5%. So I guess we'll have to wait till the fourth quarter unless you just want to confirm that now.","But look, as long as it's getting better, you're moving the right direction, that's good. I guess what irks me though is, this year's target of 12%, when you say we'll get darn close. And I know you're competitive, both of you are, your whole firm's competitive. But to be darn close, I mean, let's just get the target. Everything that you can possibly do, everyone at the firm should know that 12% RoTCE is what you're striving for. It's just that sense of intensity, even if you have it internally, it's just -- I'm not feeling it on this side of the perspective. So if you could just give us a sense of the degree of that intensity?","And I guess, lastly, I mean two years ago, you said our restructuring is over. So if you have a worst-in-class RoTCE versus your U.S. peers, either the issue is management or model. So it's either management intensity needs to pick up or maybe you need to retract the statement that a restructuring is over and take out a new fresh look? So that's my last question.","Mike Corbat","Okay. So what I would say, Mike, is that you're right, Mark and I are competitive. We are intense people. The firm is completely focused on this. But just like last year's fourth quarter, when I know you were disappointed, what I don't want to commit to is in some environment, having to do things that don't make sense for the long-term.","As an example, could we have cut and slashed and gotten our way last year to our efficiency target? Yes, we could have. In light of the rebound we saw this year, would those have been the right decisions? I don't believe that at all to be the case. And so we are committed to the 12% within the realm of what makes sense for our firm, and in particular, for our shareholders over the intermediate to longer term. And I think you've seen again in this quarter, we're pulling every lever we need to get there, but we're trying to do it smart. And you have my commitment, Mark's commitment, we're going to continue to do that to -- everything we can to deliver that 12%.","Mark Mason","I completely agree with that. I guess though, the one thing I\u2019d add just to highlight the point is that we're, obviously, trying to run this firm for its long-term sustainability and for the shareholder value that we can create. And that means making the smart decisions through the quarter around how we spend money and around how we evolve that model.","So, what I mean by that is if you think about what we talked about in the way of capacity adjustments that we've had to make and the repositioning around that, those are increased expenses that we're having to take in the quarter and through the year.","A short-minded view of that would be that that is against the 12% target that we're trying to deliver. When you're trying to run a firm for the long-term sustainability, you take those decisions because they're the right decisions to do and you realize that over time, they will pay dividends and benefits to the franchise. And so, yes, without a doubt, 12% is our target. People know that up and down in this firm. But we're going to run the firm responsibly. So hopefully that makes sense, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Yes, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Saul, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi. This is Saul Martinez. So I wanted to also ask about 2020. I realize there's a high level of uncertainty in the macro outlook. You're going through your budgeting process currently. But given what you know about your current rate sensitivity, what the forward curve is telling you right now where long rates are at, what you're seeing in the economy, how confident are you that some revenue is still the base case for 2020 -- some revenue growth target is still the base case for next year?","Mark Mason","Yes, Saul. Thank you. We're -- like you said, we're pulling that together as part of the budget process. We do know, as you suggested that there will be a full year impact to the rate reductions that we've have seen thus far through the year and any additional rate reductions that we see in the balance of the year, and so that's going to be a headwind that we got to face off.","That said, there is certainty around that direction that we've seen play out. There's been FX volatility through the year that has caused a markets reaction in terms of that volatility, generating client activity. And I bring that up because there are puts and takes that play out across our businesses as the market evolves. And there's still uncertainty around trade and how much progress we continue to make through the year on that topic. There's still uncertainty around Brexit and what happens there. And so, as those things get hopefully finalized or additional decisions get made, those will be factors that we've got to consider as we look at 2020 and pull that plan together and before we're able to speak to what that target is from an RoTCE point of view or what levers we can pull to get to that target. And so, it is still in progress, I guess is how I'd have to respond to that Saul.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No I get that and I wasn't too much asking specifically about RoTCE, but just the topline and whether the degree of confidence that there could actually be some growth because that would -- that obviously -- in this environment the fact that you are less rate sensitive than a lot of your peers does differentiate you. But okay...","Mark Mason","And I do -- I mean I do -- we do expect to see continued growth in our cards business. We do expect to see continued growth in our global consumer franchise. So, as we reference kind of those core components to the franchise if you will into our network businesses, we do expect continued momentum there, but we do have to factor in some of these headwinds and unknowns.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Let me change gears a little bit and ask you about CECL and not the day one impact. I know you guys for some time have given the estimated day one impact of CECL and a range there. But how should we think about the day two impact on loan loss provisioning going forward? Credit losses are credit losses over the life of the loan. They will be the same regardless of the accounting framework, but there are a lot of puts and takes. Your starting point, ALLL ratio will be higher, but given level of charge-offs will mean more provisioning and mix plays an important role. And it seems like, you are growing in higher loss content lending in the U.S. But have you thought about how CECL in an environment where maybe things don't really deteriorate much where we don't have a big change of the macro backdrop towards the team, how CECL impacts your ongoing level of provisioning going forward and so just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that?","Mark Mason","Yes. So we haven't given any guidance on day two as you said. Obviously, the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be. We obviously have a mix of both consumer loans and corporate loans and so, all of those factors will come into play. I guess, what I would say is, as we thought about our forecast and we factored in what the longer-term impact would be of CECL, but we haven't given any particular guidance and I can't really speak to it any more specifically than that.","Saul Martinez","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much guys.","Mark Mason","Thank you. Operator, who is next?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven, your line is open.","Steven Chubak","Thanks very much. So, wanted to start off with a question on NII. Mark, I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that pressured the markets related to NII specifically. As I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding costs were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability-sensitive trading book. Now with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down and I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side. Why the book isn't acting a little bit more liability sensitive? And should we see any funding benefit over time as the Fed continues easing?","Mark Mason","Yes. So, I think -- look I think it's -- if you turn the page that page 11 kind of highlighted the mix that -- the dynamic that you're referencing and that I spoke to which is that, we're obviously seeing lower NIR on our -- from our Markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset in markets non-NIR. And while you're right, that we have talked about funding costs and its impact and there is a funding cost benefit that plays through as rates come down, the dynamic around the markets revenues is overshadowing that, if you will. So, this mix impact is more significant than the funding cost\/benefit that we're seeing. So, an example of this, the first thing I'd say is that as you would imagine, we manage our Markets business not for NIR and non-NIR but for total revenues and so that composition and that mix can and has varied.","The NIR component is a function of the client demand and how traders manage the risk and fund positions, and so that is essentially what we're seeing play out here. So, one example of that is we could be long in asset that generates interest revenue, long for example because we have an -- we have inventory in place to facilitate that client activity. We could hedge that position with a derivative, and that impact of that hedge was hidden on NIR in principal transactions. And so it's that type of positioning that is impacting the mix and this mix is overshadowing the funding cost\/benefit.","Steven Chubak","Got it. But I guess thinking -- even taking a more holistic view, looking at principal transactions plus NII as the key trading proxy, it sounds like you should still see some benefit on the funding side over time as rates do come down. But the geography, I'd assume, may be different.","Mark Mason","The geography may be different. Again, we are seeing a funding benefit. It's just being overshadowed.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Okay. And just one more follow-up from me. On the retail bank strategy, you highlight some of the progress growing deposits through the legacy card channel and digital sales. You also alluded to the possibility of maybe forging new partnerships to build further scale and I was hoping if you could speak to maybe what some of those partnerships might look like.","And then just bigger picture, as you think about the need to add scale to the U.S. retail franchise, whether it might make more sense to grow inorganically, and is that even a viable option given your current size or the current share of industry liabilities that you currently retain?","Mike Corbat","Sure. I'm not, on this call, going to speak to specific names, but in the not-too-distant future, you will see us coming out. And you know our portfolio of world-class partners in our co-brands and in our Retail Services businesses and we've been working with a number of them on new value propositions around those offerings. Again, very similar to the ways that we've rolled out our own propriety products and so in the not-too-distant future, you'll hear more coming on that.","Steven Chubak","And then bigger picture, just the retail bank strategy and appetites maybe growing organically.","Mike Corbat","It depends on your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find, as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns, wide open to it.","In terms of being out there buying a national consumer bank, I don't see that today but -- in particular, given where some valuations are and I think given what's at stake on the digital side of things but -- again, never dismiss it. But we're very focused on the things that we can do organically, our investment in digital.","And again, I think you've seen what we've done there in terms of on the consumer side, the institutional side, using the digital strategy to not just reinforce but continue to grow our franchise.","Steven Chubak","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika, please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Just a few follow-up questions. On Chubak's questions with regard to net interest revenue, could you remind us on -- clearly, there's been a lot of volatility in terms of yield curve expectations? And could you remind us in terms of how your balance sheet is positioned today, what the sensitivity is to 25 basis points of rate cuts?","Mark Mason","Sure. So, we've talked about this in the past in terms of if you look at the IRE that we have in the -- in our 10-Qs. For the third quarter, you'll see that, that won't have materially changed. So, the simple math is that a 25-basis-point cut would result in a reduction of $50 million.","Now, that is the simple math. And the impact is, in fact, greater than what that math would imply. And it's greater because the IRE analysis is based on a parallel shift and we've certainly seen flattening of the curve as well as the pace of the cuts is faster. And the impact on deposit pricing sensitivity obviously is an important factor. So, we got a curve that's flatter and lower than expected. And the impact of the future cuts will kind of depend on the pace and the shape of the curve and the competitive environment. So those are all factors that influence that simple math, but the simple math has not changed.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up to Glenn's question earlier, year-over-year growth in Branded Card revenues of 11%, you noted, Mark, that you're sort of at the right shift in terms of the mix in that portfolio. And as we think about 2020, should growth in Branded Cards revenue more reflect the sort of mid-single-digit loan growth that you've been showing?","Mark Mason","Yes, we would expect that volume at that pace would be the major driver. There still be \u2013 there may still be a little bit of spread, but it will be mostly volume at the pace you've seen taking off at this stage or picking up at this stage.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt, please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","You're obviously one of the most global banks, and given all the trade uncertainty, there is naturally a perception that you're impacted by all this more than others. And was wondering, one, if you could just talk about that in terms of what areas you think it is maybe dragging down some of the business. And then, two, I think in the past, you talked about there are some puts and takes. So if you do less trade with one country, there are some offsets with some others. So just try to elaborate on some of those circumspect?","Mike Corbat","Sure. I think that without a doubt, and this was reinforced, Matt, a few weeks ago when I was in China, that in certain economies around the world, tariffs, trade tensions have certainly impacted trade. It's impacted in two ways. One, from a volume perspective, I think we see less trade in movement today. And I think the second way, which you alluded to, is that we've also seen the rerouting of trade. And the example, we gave is today, China is not necessarily consuming less soy. It's just getting its soy from different places in the world.","And so I think our ability as a global bank to move with our clients on both sides in terms of the importer and exporter and to be helping them rethink what those trade routes and what that supply chain looks like, I think we've been very effective at. And I think the other piece that, I don't think any of us can escape is that at least for right now with some of these uncertainties it has caused a slowdown in terms of trade. I think our businesses have shown a good resiliency. And again, our trade is included as part of our TTS numbers.","But to Mark's earlier point, if we can start to get some clarity on some of these things where I think businesses can have a little bit more surety of \u2013 in terms of the future, I think our trade business would definitely benefit from that.","Matt O'Connor","And do you think \u2013 obviously, this could to be a directional negative, I think, on the revenue in the near-term here. But do you think it kind of increased the relationship you have with all your global corporates, right? Because you're one of the few banks out there that can kind of shift to some of the trade mix and just let's you kind of flex maybe more of your muscles than if trade wasn't so complicated?","Mike Corbat","I think that's right. Our ability to be in the room not just trade, but more broadly define supply chain management, really what that means in terms of a lot of companies today that operate in kind of this just-in-time inventory is critical. And as an example, what we've seen out of the China mix is trade routes with Vietnam and India being a couple of the beneficiaries of that. And I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means has us pretty well positioned out there and it something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and is part of.","Mark Mason","And I think we're uniquely positioned to be part of that dialogue, just given the globality in our presence in over 98 countries, et cetera so.","Matt O'Connor","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy, please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions, one just wanted to understand how you're thinking about GSIB surcharge size. Because I think you're a little bit above where you were in December. Does that matter to you? Not sure if it does.","Mark Mason","Sure. So we are obviously -- in December, we were at a 3%. We are targeting being at a 3% again for 2019. Where we're at in that bucket does matter as capital implications if you think about how it fits into our TCE requirement. So it absolutely matters and we're targeting being at a 3% by the end of the year.","Betsy Graseck","And is there anything in particular that you have to do to get there? Or is it just normal course?","Mark Mason","Well, I mean we obviously we\u2019ll look at client demand that we have. We'll look at returns for the use of the balance sheet that we have. And our primary objective obviously would be to meet client demand where we can grow and do so with returns that make sense for the franchise, and so that's kind of a primary objective.","We think we can do that through the balance of this year and deliver as a 3% GSIB bank. If we start to see in the future growth that takes us beyond that, we want to be thoughtful and responsible about, how we capture that and ensure that we're getting the commensurate returns that make sense.","But we're actively managing how we're using the balance sheet, how we're engaged with our clients. And where it makes sense to put on higher returning assets, we're doing so. And where it makes sense to reduce those that are lower returning, we're doing so. And it's that dynamic that we'll manage to get to where we need to be for the end of the year.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay, thanks Mark. So Mike, question just on the consumer business, a little bit broader. You're a nationwide business in card, and you are a little bit more targeted -- well, you used to be nationwide in mortgage. Now you're more targeted around your customer set.","I know you're looking to move into different geographies. You have the deposit and you've got some wealth. And I'm just trying to understand how you think about that footprint and that collection of businesses. And is -- maybe give us -- help us understand the strategic angle and where you're taking the U.S. business, where you want to take the U.S. business over in the next, say, three years or so.","Does deposit lead first into new geographies and then you fill them with other products? Or is -- maybe you can loop in some of the inorganic discussion that you have before?","Mike Corbat","Well I would say, today, it is primarily organic than it is fundamentally technology-driven. So using some of the things you cited that you saw, one, today from a physical presence, we've got 6 large presences across the United States.","But as you referenced, we've got truly a national cards franchise. And depending whether you cut the line at our proprietary network or you go to some of our co-brand and retail partners, we're touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States, virtually in every state.","And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experiments that we've doing on the deposit site, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, 2\/3 of those brought in outside of those six markets.","Of those deposits that were brought in; over 50% of those deposits were brought in by people who do not have the relationship -- the depository relationship with the bank. And so, I think our ability to continue to build on that will be smart around the advantage we have, and that is that we know these people.","When you think about proprietary perspective or you think about the length of some of our co-brand relationships and what we know, we know where you live, we know what you spend, we know how much you earn. And by the way, we know who your bank is and we can be targeting people around that.","So we think there's a real opportunity in many ways. We think it's very much a unique opportunity because there's really no bank out there that has the same national presence that we have from our cards portfolio. So again, not just from a proprietary perspective, but how do we engage with our partners and how do we create the right value propositions in each direction. And I think we've got a good plan against that, and you're going to be seeing more of that in the not-too-distant future.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Because it does feel like great brand value, maybe a little bit underlevered in the revenue line here; and so, I'm just wondering, do you build on that with incremental products like mortgage across these different geographies, kind of going back to where you were pre-crisis where you were much more nationwide and a much broader set of products?","Mike Corbat","And again, I wouldn't rule out \u2013 and we've been asked, Betsy, I wouldn't rule out branch openings and changing that number from six to something higher. But first, it's going to come through digital engagement. And from that digital engagement, you'll likely see us start or build on that relationship off of the card through a deposit relationship. And then like most people that are in the digital space, you continue to add on to that. And so for us, let's make sure the value proposition works. I think we're seeing that. Let's build on that. And then as we have success, open to building more branches and areas where that makes sense and certainly open to adding more products.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks Mike.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty, please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I have two questions. One is we looked at the \u2013 going back to the financial markets, kind of in an odd number. Isn't it also that as the inversion of the yield curve when long rates come down, the assets that are in the inventory are tied to the longer part of the curve, and the funding is tied to the shorter end of the curve. So, the inversion really does have a pretty meaningful impact on your mix revenue in that particular segment. And that also makes a difference because as the Fed catches up with the long end of the curve, that part of your NII can actually see a benefit going forward, which will be different than what you'll see in a normal kind of retail bank.","Mark Mason","There are some impact there, but I think less so relative to the mix dynamic that I was describing. So \u2013 but you're right, there is some impact that flows through because of that dynamic.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then kind of looking at the bigger picture not \u2013 in other words, I've been on your side and haven't hit a target, and you have to put a target. And yet when you say the word target, it is a target, right, it is the direction you're going in, which I think is much more important than if I'm 11.9 or 12.1. It's the direction of improvement that you're kind of continuing to be able to go through that path. And if you look at this, and I look at this particular story and investment, creating a tangible book value as a big piece of what I think we hadn't talked about is that tangible book value is up 12% over the last year. So if your tangible book value is growing double digits, you got a 3% dividend that I'd love to know your opinion on whether or not that's defensible through the downturn in the cycle, but I think we set up CCAR to make it defensible So if you have a sustainable dividend, you're growing your tangible book value and you're progression in returns is on the upward trend, then I think trading at tangible book value is a pretty good bargain. So, just wanted to kind of think about those three avenues or those metrics.","Mike Corbat","Sure. Mark, why don't we tag team? So one, Marty, I would say that from a dividend perspective, when you look at that, roughly 3% dividend yield, $2.04 a share, a little over two billion shares outstanding, so somewhere slightly north of $4 billion on a net income base in the high-teens. So I think clear sustainability of dividend, and in any reasonable environment, I think ample headroom to continue to take that up.","The other piece obviously is the flexibility we have in terms of buyback and the amount that we have there. And we've talked about the components of the combination of earnings, of goodwill, intangible DTA-type usage in there that gives us a bit more capacity, and so again, I think ample flexibility.","And as you've said in here, it's not just hitting any particular target, but in and around. And obviously, our primary focus here, which I think we try to use other things as proxies for, is to \u2013 some of the earlier conversations is continuing to on both end, absolute and relative basis, continue to grow our return on tangible common equity, so continue to take that up in any reasonable environment and also continue to close the gap to peers as part of that.","Mark Mason","I think that's spot on, Mike. The only thing I'd add to your point around continued progress is if you look back to 2018 and we had a target of a 10.5% RoTCE, we were able to deliver on the 10.9%. We talked about a 12% for this year. We're on track year-to-date to do that. We've talked about returning capital over the three CCAR cycles at $60 billion-plus. We're at $60 billion-plus. And so we are continually trying to demonstrate progress on those very important metrics, not the least of which is this RoTCE, and we plan to continue to do so.","Marty Mosby","Yes, and I think the progress and sustainability are the two key words that you talked about there. Continued progress and sustainability of what you've already achieved through any reasonable outcomes is the things that I would \u2013 I just wanted to confirm. So thanks for that.","Mark Mason","Agreed. Agreed. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick ones. It was good to see the overall deposit cost start to turn down this quarter. Can you just talk about deposit strategies from here? And how do you expect the betas to act, especially you're still \u2013 you are putting out that national rate? How are you trying to match off against the lower rate side on the asset side with the deposit cost? Thanks.","Mark Mason","Yes. Our consumer deposits, while we did get growth in volume there, we did see pressure from a spread point of view. Keep in mind, our U.S. consumer deposit is about $150 billion, and the betas are generally low as it relates to those consumer deposits. And so as \u2013 we're not \u2013 as we saw the rate environment increasing a year or so ago, we didn't see the benefits of that.","And so similarly, and we didn't see the impact of that. And so similarly, as we see rate cuts play out, we're not going to see that play through either. And so we kind of low betas on the consumer side likely to continue there.","As it relates to pricing, for the high yield savings accounts, for example, which has been part of our growth strategy, just part, we have adjusted pricing for those and for money market accounts. And we've been doing that over the past quarter or so as we've seen interest rates come down, and you should expect that we'll continue to do that to be aligned with the market.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And follow-up on the capital side. So you're at 11.6% on CET1. You talked about 11.5% year-end. Rates have obviously been a helper, and the capital return continues underneath. Can you talk about just like what happens post 2019 in terms of your willingness to let the CET1 ratio continue to come down in the context of still seeing a big capital return number and given what the outlook is for earnings underneath? Thanks.","Mark Mason","Sure. So you're right, we did see kind of CET1 come down from second quarter to third quarter. We also saw that last year as well second to third quarter as we start to execute on the capital return that's approved as part of the CCAR cycle. There's somewhat of a natural dip there, but there's also the planning that we've talked to around getting down to what we thought \u2013 what we think is a prudent level of a capital hole, which is about 11.5%.","So we are in line, I would say, with our expectations to be roughly at 11.5% by the end of the year. You'll recall that, that 11.5% has a management buffer in it. That buffer is meant to account for some of the uncertainty and volatility and some of the proposals that are still outstanding that could have an impact on capital requirements.","But at this stage, without complete clarity on how some of those things change, we feel like 11.5% is still the prudent level at which to run the firm. That means then going into 2020, we will first have to think about client demand and growth juxtaposed against what we're able to generate in the way of net income that will be available to common shareholders and the DTA that we're able to reduce.","And based on that reduction of a disallowed DTA, we will be able to determine how much capital we can in fact return to shareholders. And so that's how we'll think about capital return going forward. But the CET1 target at this stage remains at the 11.6% level.","Ken Usdin","Thanks Mark.","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, thanks. Yes, I just have two quick questions on expenses here. It sounds like on Mexico, you were kind of managing the efficiency ratio and trying to get that lower. I mean does that mean you've officially decided not to do that last piece of investment? I think you outlined it was $500 million opportunity to pull back on?","Mark Mason","Yes. So we \u2013 you're right. We have been managing Mexico very thoughtfully and trying to ensure that we continue to demonstrate EBIT growth there in light of the environment that's there and softer revenues that we've been seeing.","The expense management that we're seeing there is in part a byproduct of the investments that we made in the prior year. And so some of those investments were in building out the efficiencies around our operations and so we're starting to see some of those cost saves play out in 2019 and so that is a good thing.","We obviously will look at the balance of the investments that are to be made as part of our Mexico strategy and determine how we want to prioritize those and how we want to pace those in light of the environment that we're in. But the cost savings that we're seeing at this stage are really a byproduct of the return on the early investments we made to improve productivity and thoughtful pacing around what's left.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then just a separate one on -- you mentioned there's a continuing investment in Controls and Risk, in Corporate and Other. Are you close to a point where you've reached the peak on that? Would you expect that to trend down over time or is it still feeling that's increasing? Thanks.","Mark Mason","Sure. We do we actually do expect I think I've mentioned the outlook for Corporate\/Other being slightly higher going into the fourth quarter as a result of continued infrastructure costs. We think that's important to make as a franchise. That includes things like enhancing our data capabilities. It includes things like cybersecurity capabilities, improving our compliance and risk and finance infrastructure.","So, all of those things that we think are critical to not only running a safe and sound organization, but in many ways, to helping to drive better business operations as well. And so yes, we expect to continue to make investments in that area.","Mike Corbat","And I would say, Mark, within all of that, we -- it's not just the investment and the safety and soundness, but there's paybacks in and around on that in terms of being able to replace manual processes and other things.","Mark Mason","Absolutely. Between the automation opportunities that are there, the straight-through processing opportunities that are there, that's what I was alluding to when I said the opportunity to improve business operations. So, it's safety and soundness and those efficiencies that we'll get as an organization. So, they are investments in fact in many instances and do have paybacks associated with them.","Operator","Okay. Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard, please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Mark, good morning Mike.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us -- you identified that you had some strong performance in M&A this quarter, particularly in EMEA. Was it due to hiring people that you're having the success in M&A or is it taking market share from some of the competitors, particularly over in Europe, some of them are struggling?","Mike Corbat","I think it's both. I think when you go back and look, this isn't just a third quarter of 2019 phenomenon, but I think something we've spoken to. And I think you've seen over the last three or four years, some pretty consistent market share gains for us there. And it hasn't just been EMEA, but EMEA, I think, has been one of the top performers for us.","And so I think it's really been both, client engagement, but also, as you know, in the business of making sure you have the right people in the right seats. And again, as you've seen publicly, we've been making those investments.","Mark Mason","Yes, we've seen increases in -- when you think about share, in technology, in healthcare, in consumer. And so we've seen it across a number of sectors. As Mike said, it's a byproduct of having made those investments and being positioned to serve our clients well.","Gerard Cassidy","And then in the Markets business, obviously, we've all seen on the retail side that the trading commissions have been dropped to 0 and many of the discount brokers like the Charles Schwab or Fidelity.","In cash equities in the institutional business, we all know that the cents per trade has steadily declined. Electronic trading has reduced revenues. Is there a day that we're actually going to see zero commissions possibly in cash equities following the retail side?","Mike Corbat","We could. We could. I don't think we're right there. But again, I think a lot of it, in my mind, will have to do with information and our ability to use that information and how GDPR rolls out in the U.S. and more broadly and what we're actually permitted to do with that information. I think that's a topic for another day.","But I think that you could theoretically see certain people willing to pay for that information. I think point two is that when you actually look at with the indexation, the other thing that's going on is that the economics in terms of derivatives, the economics in terms of front brokerage, the economics in terms of custody and clearing, all areas that we've been heavily investing in.","So to the extent that the cash equity trade underlies several of those activities supported by free trade around research and other pieces, I think there's more to play out in that as well.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just lastly, you talked about the success of gathering deposits digitally, and I may have missed this, and you pointed to your high-yield savings account.","To win those deposit customers are you doing it with the high-yield savings account? Or is there a cash bonus if they open up the account online, they get an extra $100 or something like that?","Mark Mason","So we are -- so first of all, we're growing deposits more broadly than just the high-yield savings account and frankly, more broadly than just the digital. We're growing through traditional channels as well.","We do have -- broke in the high-yield savings account specifically too, and that is through an offer of higher rate. But that said, what you also heard us reference was creating value propositions as well as incentives for clients to open deposit accounts with us, i.e., offering ThankYou points, offering Double Cashback, those types of incentives that are aligned with the card as incentive for those customers to open a retail banking account with us; in this case, online or digitally.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. So you're not sending them toasters though, right?","Mark Mason","We're not. We're not. We're out of the toaster sending business at this stage.","Gerard Cassidy","All right, thank you.","Mark Mason","You bet.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. We are not getting response from Vivek Juneja. ","Mike Corbat","He may be asking his question elsewhere, operator. So with that, Liz, back to you.","Elizabeth Lynn","Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to us in Investor Relations, and have a good day.","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's call be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Mr. Kapp, you may begin.","Peter Kapp","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation which is available for download on our website, Citigroup.com. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on Management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.","Actual results and capital and other financial condition, may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to John.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Peter and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this quarter. I'd like to begin by highlighting some key points from our second quarter 2015 results, on slide 2.","Last week, we reported a strong quarter, earning $4.7 billion while making continued progress on our execution priorities. We saw balanced performance across our institutional and consumer segments.","We grew revenues and achieved positive operating leverage in Citicorp. And Citi Holdings was again profitable during the quarter. Holdings assets are down 22% over the past year, to $116 billion and we have signed agreements to sell an additional $32 billion of these assets, virtually all of which we expect to close by year end. For the first half of the year, Citigroup's efficiency ratio was 56%, our ROA was 103 basis points and we generated a return on tangible common equity of 10.5%.","We utilized $1.5 billion of deferred tax assets through the first half of 2015, contributing to continued strong capital generation. We have continued to maintain an efficient balance sheet, growing loans and deposits in Citicorp and generating a net interest margin of 295 basis points for the quarter. Credit quality remains strong across our consumer and corporate loan portfolios.","We maintained a strong funding profile, as our deposit quality continues to improve and we executed against our debt issuance plans. And our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios remained strong, as we generated $3.5 billion of CET1 capital during the quarter.","On slide 3, we show total Citigroup results, adjusted for the items noted on the slide. As I noted earlier, during the quarter, we earned $4.7 billion. Net income grew by over $700 million year over year, driven by core improvement in Citicorp.","Revenues declined on a reported basis, to $19.2 billion, but increased 3% year over year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 7% year over year and 1% in constant dollars, mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges. Our second-quarter results provide a solid start to 2015, better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations.","Turning to slide 4, we show trends in our balance sheet. Our discipline in maintaining total assets at approximately $1.8 trillion over the past year and our efforts to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet, help us prepare for regulatory requirements and achieve our return targets.","On a reported basis, our total assets declined by over $80 billion in the past year, largely as a result of the dollar's appreciation against foreign currencies, especially the euro, Mexican peso and yen. To provide more meaningful insights into our underlying business trends, we presented this slide and several others in today's presentation, on a constant dollar basis.","On this basis, net loans and deposits in Citicorp grew 4% and 3%, respectively, year over year across our businesses, offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings. We have maintained a liquid balance sheet, with 27% of our assets in cash and investments and approximately half of our balance sheet funded by deposits.","We were able to further reduce short-term borrowings by $13 billion in the quarter and $32 billion from last year, as a result of growth in high quality deposits, as we managed our liquidity profile.","Slide 5 shows the trends in our loan portfolio. In constant dollars, total Citigroup loans decreased 1% year over year, as 4% growth in Citicorp was offset by continued significant reductions in Citi Holdings. Consumer loans grew 1% year over year, with broad-based growth driving a 3% increase in international consumer loans. Corporate loans grew 6% year over year. Our corporate lending portfolio increased 10%, with growth in North America and EMEA, as we continued to support our target clients.","Private bank volumes increased, particularly in North America and TTS loans declined 11%, as we have maintained our return profile by reducing our balances of trade finance receivables in response to spread compression in certain markets, especially China. Citi Holdings loans decreased 33% year over year, driven by a $16 billion reduction in North America mortgages, as well as the impact of our previously announced agreements to sell OneMain and the Japan credit card business.","On slide 6, we show continued stability in our consumer and corporate credit trends. In the second quarter, consumer credit remained favorable, with a net credit loss rate of 224 basis points. In North America and Asia, trends remained broadly stable. And in Latin America, the NCO rate decreased somewhat from last quarter, consistent with delinquency trends.","Our corporate portfolio also continues to see favorable credit performance. Nonaccrual loans remained stable, at 38 basis points of corporate loans. Latin America declined, as we sold the nonaccrual loans. And North America increased, primarily driven by downgrades in our energy portfolio.","We built reserves against our energy exposures by approximately $43 million in the quarter, mainly related to our North America E&P exposures. We again realized virtually no NCL's against the energy sector during the quarter. While we are building reserves, we continue to believe that the risk is well contained and we expect any losses we incur to be manageable.","Turning to slide 7, we show our deposit composition. Citicorp deposits grew 3% in constant dollars, with continued high quality deposits flows across our franchise. Consumer deposits increased 3%, with 4% growth in international markets.","Corporate deposits increased 8% year over year, with a continued focus on growing high quality deposits and limiting lower quality deposits, such as non-operating deposits of financial institutions. Citi Holdings and other deposits declined significantly year over year, driven by the impact of our agreement to sell the Japan retail business which resulted in the reclassification of $21 billion of deposits to held for sale last year, as well as the continued transfer of MSSB deposits to Morgan Stanley which has now been completed.","Slide 8 demonstrates the diversity and stability of our deposit franchise. Over 55% of our deposits are outside the U.S., providing local funding for our overseas operations. We run these operations with balance sheets that are largely matched by currency and liquidity characteristics. ","Overall, Citigroup's deposits have a 74% liquidity value under the LCR, up 100 basis points from last quarter. We expect deposit quality to remain relatively stable at this level, based on our current business mix. Each 100 basis point improvement in liquidity value reduces our HQLA requirement by approximately $9 billion.","In our consumer business, our deposits have an 87% LCR liquidity value. Our efforts to deepen our relationships with retail customers, including increasing the penetration of direct deposit and bill pay, as well as other products like mortgages and credit card, have also served to increase the stickiness of our deposits.","And in the corporate business, we have increased the liquidity value of deposits to approximately 68%. We have reduced non-operating deposits with 100% runoff to $56 billion currently, down by about one-third over the past year. And we continue to work with clients to grow operating accounts, while reducing lower LCR liquidity value deposits.","On slide 9, we update our regulatory liquidity metrics. Our LCR, under the U.S. rules, is 111%, in excess of the 100% minimum requirement and consistent with the levels we have maintained over the past year. Over time, we would expect to manage our LCR in the range of 105% to 110%, based on current regulatory requirements.","As of June 30, our HQLA was $386 billion, down $15 billion from the prior quarter. Our estimated net outflows under the LCR declined by $14 billion during the quarter, reflecting the improvement in the LCR liquidity value of our deposits, as well as the continued reduction of our short-term borrowings. Continued discipline around our funding structure will allow us to maintain an efficient level of liquidity.","On the right side, you can see the composition of our HQLA as of the end of the quarter, over 80% of which is in cash and sovereign debt. We continue to expect the U.S. regulators to propose a U.S. version of the net stable funding ratio sometime during 2015. We believe that our NSFR is in excess of 100% under the international version of the NSFR rule.","On slide 10, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin. Our net interest margin increased sequentially, to 295 basis points, driven by a higher-than-expected contribution from trading NIM which can fluctuate quarter to quarter.","Excluding this impact, our net interest margin would have been closer to 291 basis points and we expect to maintain roughly this level for the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results will depend in part on the timing of a number of upcoming actions, including the completion of our OneMain and Japan retail business sales and our planned debt buybacks. ","And as you can see on slide 29 in the appendix, we continue to expect a NIM benefit from a rising rate environment, consistent with recent quarters. Our estimate of the net interest revenue benefit and a 100 basis point instantaneous rate shock scenario, increased modestly to $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion reflects the impact of U.S. rates. In managing our interest rate risk, we routinely consider the impact of many scenarios, including a range of market and macro-economic conditions, as well as the expected behavior of our clients.","On slide 11, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the quarter, our long-term debt increased slightly, to $212 billion. Bank-issued debt declined $2 billion, as we reduced our reliance on credit cards securitizations, in anticipation of the potential impact of TLAC. Parent company debt increased by $3 billion during the quarter, to $155 billion.","We currently expect to end the year with total Parent company long-term debt of roughly $160 billion. Our weighted average maturity fell to 6.7 years, due in part to the repurchase of some longer-dated securities during the quarter. Over time, we intend to maintain our WAM at around seven years. And our total preferred stock stands at $14 billion, providing nearly 110 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital.","On slide 12, we update our issuance and redemption expectations for long-term debt in 2015. For the full year 2015, we expect to issue approximately $25 billion of benchmark debt. We issued nearly $16 billion of senior and subordinated debt during the first half of the year, including offerings in dollars, euros and Canadian dollars.","For the remainder of the year, we expect to issue approximately $10 billion of benchmark debt. Year to date, in addition to $10 billion of maturities, we have reduced long-term debt by an additional $11 billion, including $6 billion of buybacks. For the balance of the year, we expect additional repurchases of $4 billion to $5 billion of benchmark debt.","As previously indicated, we expect to buy back some of our higher-cost debt in connection with the completion of our sell of OneMain. Consistent with our prior debt buybacks, these will be NPV positive and will help us lower our cost of funds.","In the first half of 2015, we issued $3.5 billion of preferred stock. We will remain opportunistic around market conditions and currently expect to issue an additional $2 billion or so of preferred in the second half of 2015, as we continue to build towards 150 basis points of additional Tier 1 capital. On slide 13, we update our estimates of our total loss absorbing capacity, based on the FSB's November 2014 consultative document and our ongoing discussions with regulators and other industry participants.","We have yet to see any formal proposals or feedback from our regulators, although we continue to expect something this year. Accordingly, consistent with our prior estimates, we include CET1 capital, preferred stock and unsecured parent-issued senior and subordinated debt with at least one year remaining until maturity, as well as a small portion of our customer-related debt, in our estimates of TLAC.","We estimate Citigroup's total loss-absorbing capacity increased to $273 billion or 21.3% of our risk-weighted assets and 11.4% of our total leverage exposure. We calibrate this 21.3% against potential requirements of 22% to 26%, depending upon the base TLAC requirement of 16% to 20% and at 3.5% GSIB surcharge.","I'll discuss the Fed's final GSIB rules more in a minute. This range translates to $282 billion to $333 billion of required TLAC or $9 billion to $60 billion more than our current TLAC estimate.","We have identified a number of sources with which to meet this incremental TLAC need, as necessary. As we have previously communicated, we already expect to issue $4 billion to $6 billion of preferred stock, as well as net issuance of $6 billion to $8 billion of subordinated debt, to meet our other existing regulatory capital requirements.","And then, to the extent additional TLAC is required, we estimate approximately $10 billion of existing principal-protected notes, within our customer related debt, may become eligible under the final rules. And an addition $10 billion of customer-related debt could possibly be included, with some structural changes to our issuance program. These sources alone total nearly $35 billion of potential TLAC-eligible funding.","Beyond that, if necessary we would look to issue incremental senior debt to replace non-TLAC eligible funding, including non-eligible customer-related debt, securitizations and repo financing. So we have multiple ways of addressing our potential TLAC requirements based on proposals to date, but we continue to await formal regulatory guidance or rules.","Turning to slide 14, let me summarize our capital position which remains among the strongest in the industry. During the quarter, our fully phased in CET1 capital ratio increased approximately 30 basis points, to 11.4%, driven by our retained earnings and DTA utilization and after returning $1.7 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and common stock dividends.","Risk-weighted assets under advanced approaches also decreased $5 billion, to $1.279 billion. Under transition agreements, our CET1 capital ratio increased by 50 basis points, to 13.8%. Our supplementary leverage ratio grew to 6.7%, driven by the strong capital generation and $2 billion of preferred stock issuance, as well as a decline in our leveraged exposure. Citibank's SLR also increased 10 basis points in the quarter, to 6.7%.","On slide 15, let me address the final U.S. GSIB surcharge rule released yesterday. Our review of the rule is ongoing. With that said, I'd like to make several observations about our current understanding. While in many ways the final rule is consistent with the December proposal, it does include several important changes.","First, the final rule determines the GSIB surcharge based on fixed aggregate measures of systemic importance, rather than the relative measures used in the proposed rule. Second, it replaces a spot FX rate with a three-year average of daily exchange rates. And third, it better recognizes the regulatory treatment of certain types of short-term wholesale funding.","Most notably, it reduces the penalty for holding non-operational deposits which have been addressed separately through the LCR. Under the original proposal, we estimated that we would be subject to a 4% GSIB surcharge. We now expect a 3.5% surcharge, based on our current interpretation of the final rule, consistent with the Fed's estimate.","While this final rule did not go as far as we would have liked, especially with respect to the treatment of deposits, it is clearly a move in the right direction. As described, this rule affirmatively allows the industry to better measure the impact of specific actions on each firm's GSIB surcharge, consistent with the Fed's policy objectives.","Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, we reported solid results in the second quarter, with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. And we utilized $1.5 billion of DTAs in the first half.","Second, we have actively managed our balance sheet, maintaining total assets around $1.8 trillion and optimizing our assets and liabilities to support client needs and improve returns. Credit trends remain favorable across both our consumer and corporate portfolios and we have maintained a stable net interest margin.","Third, our deposit base remains a key strength, as we continue to improve the liquidity value of our deposits. Our 2015 issuance plans are on track, including preparations for formal guidance related to TLAC. And lastly, we have continued to prepare our business and balance sheet for the ongoing evolution of the regulatory environment. Our capital and liquidity remains strong.","This concludes our fixed income review. I'll now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ryan O'Connell","I would like to talk about two areas and one is just to clarify some things about Holdings. You've mentioned that there are $32 billion of sales in the pipeline. I guess I'd like to know how much of that is actually reflected in the numbers already? Or let's put it another way. Once those sales are completed which I think you've indicated might be by year end, what would be, ballpark, the level of assets in Holdings?","John Gerspach","It's kind of simple. If you just did those $32 billion, the 112 billion [ph] and of all $32 billion -- if $116 billion, the $116 billion of all $32 billion closed would drop down to 84%. Now of course, we'd also have other activities during the third and the fourth quarter, but all $32 billion that I mentioned are contained in the $116 billion.","Ryan O'Connell","And then on the earnings call, I think what you said is that the target was to operate Holdings at breakeven. I wasn't sure if it was in to next year or through next year?","John Gerspach","Our goal is to operate Holdings at a breakeven through next year.","Ryan O'Connell","Secondary is on North American cards. Just if we could talk about some of the trends there? If I look at the branded cards, purchase sales are up 5%, so that is good. But if we look at the revenues, accounts, loans, they're all down about, let's say, 4% or 5%. And at least one of your competitors, JP, cards are up about 1%, sales are up about 7%. So I know you said on the call that branded cards is an area for investment. But I wondered if you could share a little bit more color on how you plan to restore growth in that business?","John Gerspach","That's exactly where the investments would be targeted, Ryan. I think that one of the things that we did coming out of the crisis -- certainly during the crisis, we had slowed down investments, as you can imagine, in virtually all of our products. Coming out of the crisis, we did ramp up marketing spend in branded cards, if you go back to 2010, 2011, but we really got substandard results from that marketing spend, simply because it was really our product array that needed work.","So we've been -- Jud Linville and his team have been hard at work, over the last couple of years, to really improve our product offerings. And I think they've done a great job, standardizing the product offering on a couple of common platforms and now that we've got the product array in place, what we believe is our next thing is, we need to get, once again then, begin to lift the level of marketing spend that we have in our cards business. So that is something that you will be seeing during the second half of this year and then clearly into 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robert Smalley","I had a couple of questions, one on metals and mining exposure and then just a couple of questions on issuance around TLAC. First, on the metals and mining, could you talk about your exposure to coal, iron ore and copper? Specifically, I'm interested in if you can provide any numbers.","But also, I know that there has been a lot of reports about regulators clamping down or criticizing more assets in oil and gas. I'm wondering if the same thing has happened in coal? And what your experience has been with the portfolio there, as we're starting to see some of these companies file or try and restructure their outstanding debt?","John Gerspach","Yes, Robert, I'm sorry. I'm not prepared to talk about anything to do with metals and mining exposure on this call, simply because, quite frankly, as we were preparing for subjects that we thought might be of interest, we didn't see anything in our portfolio that looked like it was going to draw questions.","Robert Smalley","So if we could shift over to a couple of the questions around slides 12 and 13. John, you had mentioned and I'm talking about slide 13 here. On potential TLAC requirements, two things you had mentioned potentially, $10 billion in principal protected notes that might be included and then $10 billion with some structural changes. I believe last time, you had alluded to the -- making some modifications in structured notes. But has there been any change? Or why did you identify the principal protected notes as well? Have you gotten any guidance along those lines?","John Gerspach","I think we're just using maybe slightly different words to describe what was essentially the same as last year. The only thing I think we've noted is that we do think, now, there has probably two groups of $10 billion, as opposed to one group of $10 billion. We are getting some feedback that there could be some change in the definitions of the customer-related debt that would be included.","And therefore, it is possible that roughly $10 billion of those principal protected notes might then, therefore, become TLAC eligible. And then, there's also the other $10 billion that we think we could get to TLAC eligibility with some structural change. But all of that is going to be dependent on exactly how the final rule comes out and the specifics that would be contained therein.","Robert Smalley","And then finally, on page 12, you had mentioned about $10 billion left to do in benchmark issuance this year. So far, I think you've done about $11.5 billion senior, $4 billion subordinated. Will that upcoming $10 billion be in the same proportion, senior to sub? Or have you fulfilled the sub requirement for 2015?","John Gerspach","I'm not going to address the mix that we might do towards the end of the year. But again, we are focused on doing $10 billion of the benchmark debt. But I really can't give you specific guidance as to what percentage might be or might not be, in either of those categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Knutson with Legal & General. Please go ahead.","David Knutson","A couple of questions have been answered, but I wanted to ask a broader question about your emerging market exposures. The outlook, I think you talked about Asia being optimistic or optimistic on Asia, but Latin America seems to be struggling. It's a core part of the business. How does -- how patient will the bank be with some of the franchises throughout the region, as it goes through, maybe, a cyclical or structural decline?","John Gerspach","Yes, David, interesting question. But the good thing is, what we have is really and what we've built, is truly a client-focused business. We're in these regions to support our clients. And when we take a look at whether it's some of the [indiscernible] countries that are either in Latin America or Asia or anywhere in the world, for the most part, the business that we do in those countries -- certainly on the corporate side, our institutional business -- is really focused, for the most part, on the subs of multinational clients that we bank around the world. So we feel very good about the credit quality of those relationships.","We're not in those countries competing with the local banks for local businesses. We're either serving, as I said, the subs of those multinational clients or in certain instances, we'll be serving very large local multi-nationals. But we tend to focus our business on that specific client segment.","And then to the extent we're in those countries with our consumer business, for the most part, our consumer business is really focused on what I'll call the mass affluent customer base. And again, that's largely an urban-based customer segment. And I think you've seen the results of how our credit performance has held up, over time, in the consumer business.","And clearly in Asia, even with everything that had gone on in Korea and to a certain extent still goes on within Korea -- our NCL rate in Asia has hovered somewhere between 80 and 96 or 95 basis points. So we think that we're focused on, certainly, the right customer segment for us and it's something that we are very vigilant about.","David Knutson","Your comment regarding no increase of NCLs from energy sector exposures, I appreciate. I imagine they flow in over time. Do you have an expectation of when, broadly speaking, analysts or we should start to expect to see energy companies crack? I guess people made a lot of noise when the oil price first dropped, but I imagine it takes time for companies to recognize the risk.","John Gerspach","David, if you think, on a public call, I'm going to tell you the time when -- energy companies are going to crack, come on.","David Knutson","All right, so maybe, from a different perspective I'm expecting the losses to come in over time. There shouldn't be any particular quarter. Or is there something about your energy exposures which would lump a loss recognition?","John Gerspach","I don't think that you should be looking at any lumpy loss recognition. We've built the reserves. We'd like to think that we could manage through this without taking any significant NCLs. During the quarter, as I think I mentioned on last week's call, we did increase our overall exposure to energy and energy-related businesses, by $1 billion, $1.5 billion.","But importantly, we reduced our exposure to what might be considered to be the riskiest element of that business which would be the E&P segment, that actually came down. So the E&P segment now represents, I think, something like 27% of our energy portfolio. That's down from North of 30%, where it would have been last quarter. So again, this is all part of active management of the portfolio, as you would expect us to do.","David Knutson","And the last question, it's regarding TLAC, what you laid out. And when you think about the expected timetable to comply with it, it doesn't look to be that punitive, unless all the big banks will rush to comply, like they have with some of the other rules that have come out. In my mind, this is something that doesn't prohibit capital distributions or some other thing that would encourage management teams to rush to implement it quickly. Is that the right way to think about a TLAC requirement? That the full implementation time period will be used, instead of everyone rushing over the next two, three quarters to finish it?","John Gerspach","That would certainly be my view of it. I can't speak for others, but that's clearly my view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Jiang with Prudential. Please go ahead.","David Jiang","A question about your fully implemented Basel III RWAs. How much of that is operational risk RWAs? And if you could break it down between what's in Holdings and at the core?","John Gerspach","Yes. The overall op-risk RWA that is in the $1.279 trillion -- I think I may have said billion during the call, but I should have said $1.279 trillion. There is $325 billion of op-risk RWA in the $1.279 trillion. Within the $1.279 trillion, we've got $169 billion of risk-weighted assets associated with Holdings. And then within that $169 billion, $49 billion of that is op-risk.","David Jiang","So $49 billion of the $325 billion is in Holdings?","John Gerspach","Yes, exactly.","David Jiang","How do you think about how that rolls off? Is there a way to think about, as time passes on, that the models will incorporate less of that? Or is parts of it going to go away quicker, like Citi Holdings versus Citicorp?","John Gerspach","No, I would say that, in both cases, you're looking at multiple years before you're going to see a meaningful reduction in that amount, even as we continue to sell businesses in Holdings. Just the way of the op-risk models work and certainly, the supervisory guidance that we get indicate that it is the passage of time that ultimately, passage of time and the non-occurrence of similar events, that ultimately then will allow you to begin to take down that exposure.","That's why, as we think in terms of that $169 billion of risk-weighted assets associated with Holdings, the $120 billion of that's associated with either credit or market risk, that, as we sell the assets, we'll get out of immediately, but that last $49 billion is something that is going to trail out over a number of years.","David Jiang","Second question I had was, there has been some press reports about potentially selling Banamex U.S.A. And I was wondering would that change any of the strategy for the Banamex Mexico, the core unit?","John Gerspach","One, I'm not going to make any comment on anything that could be in the papers. And certainly, we don't comment on any sales activities or purchase activities, on these types of calls, until we're ready to announce something, but Banamex U.S.A and Banamex are two separate entities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning & Company. Please go ahead.","Michael Rogers","Just a question for you on your Standard & Poor's rating. I'm just wondering, they remain out there with a negative outlook on the Holding company, as they've been for some time, seemingly awaiting clarity on the TLAC rules. Do you get any sense from them that the solid performance that you folks have certainly put on the board in recent quarters could be increasingly sufficient enough of an offset to save the A-minus Holding company rating?","John Gerspach","That's obviously something that they'll have to determine on their own. I can't speak for them. I know that they are aware of our performance and I'm sure they'll take everything into consideration.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Louise Pitt","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have a quick question with respect to the redemptions. So that number changed slightly in the slides this quarter, I think. Could you just walk us through what, if any, are your primary drivers about how you're looking at redemptions at this point? Is it currency, is it maturities, is it coupon? Is it all of the above?","John Gerspach","It's really all of that. Some of what we do is, we look at individual debt issues that could be trading at wider spreads than what our current secondary trading levels would be. So that provides an opportunity. And it's something that we look at on an issue by issue basis is about all I can tell you, Louise. We look for those inefficiencies and try to address them.","Louise Pitt","Just a follow-up question, similarly related, but can you just clarify what approvals are needed and what the process for that is, with respect to redemption of capital securities? So either Tier 1 qualifying or Tier 2 qualifying securities? Do you have to formally request that from the Fed? Or is it just a phone call that you make ahead of taking those out?","John Gerspach","No, those are all included in the capital plan that we would submit to the Fed. So that would all be part of our CCAR submission.","Louise Pitt","So that's more of a long-term planning, rather than a pure market trading level on those securities, in terms of redemption?","John Gerspach","It's something we certainly need to contemplate in advance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arnold Kakuda with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead.","Arnold Kakuda","Quick question on, you talked about the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rates and I think you mentioned that you slightly increased the sensitivity to rates this quarter? And I just wanted to contrast that with -- I think a peer talked about increase in the duration on its balance sheet. And they swapped floating-rate instruments for fixed. So I just want to see what you guys did with the balance sheet versus a peer's comments?","John Gerspach","The increase that we had, as I said, was fairly slight. I think it went from $1.9 billion to $2 billion. So it doesn't really reflect a significant shift, nor does it reflect any sort of significant change in our overall balance sheet management approach.","Arnold Kakuda","And then on the GSIB surcharge, clearly, a 3.5% surcharge, better than the 4% that you expected, but how sticky is that 3.5%? Are there certain things that you can do to mitigate it down to maybe potentially a 3% bucket? And I guess, with some of the wind-downs in Citi Holdings for the rest of this year, would that incrementally potentially move you from a 3.5% bucket down to a lower one?","John Gerspach","Even within these buckets, don't forget there are ranges. And so when you look at the buckets, the range, at least in the buckets that we'd be looking at, basically, it's about 100 points that are in there. So the Fed, I think, published that we had a score of 714. Our own calculations came out with 715. So we're pretty close to where the Fed was.","In order to move down to the 3% bucket, we'd have to get under 630. So that would be an 85 basis point move which is not to say that it's impossible to do, but it is not necessarily something that you're going to be able to do in a short timeframe.","And we've had the final rule now for something less than 24 hours. So it's a little early for us to comment as to the feasibility or the desirability of putting together an active program to move down. The one thing you can say, that we have been saying, is we will do everything to continue to make this institution safer and stronger.","And simpler and smaller seem to be the order of the day and it's something we've been actively looking to do. So we will continue to do everything we can to drive those four things to be simpler, smaller, safer and stronger and still be able to serve our clients. And if we can do that by being in a 3% bucket, then that is exactly what we will do.","Arnold Kakuda","And then lastly, another question on ratings, but more from the Moody's side, you benefited from a notch upgrade on the methodology. But just in light of the stronger earnings that you guys have had in the past few quarters, 9% return on equity for the first half of the year, yet you're still ranked at Baa 1 on the Senior Hold Co, a notch below others at A3. So just want to see if you guys are having updated conversations with Moody's? And getting their thoughts on your fundamental improvements there?","John Gerspach","Yes, no, we have conversations with each of the rating agencies on a very regular basis. So they are fully aware of the progress that we have made and we're very hopeful that, at the appropriate time, each one of them will recognize the progress that we think is evident in not just our net income performance, but in the construct and the management of our balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning & Company. Please go ahead.","Michael Rogers","Yes, John, just to follow up. These have been awful good times in lending, for quite a period of time now. And I just wanted to get your bigger picture view, as to where you may see excesses developing in lending that Citi has or will make a conscious effort to pull back from?","John Gerspach","Again, we try to look very closely at every one of the activities that we're involved in. I think you'll note that we have been steadily moving down the league tables, when it comes to leverage finance. And so that might give you some indication of one of the areas, at least, that we would look at with somewhat less enthusiasm than others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Cavanagh with APG. Please go ahead.","Scott Cavanagh","It's clearly a star performer in the industry, on this perspective. So I just had a question on upcoming regulatory rulings or potential rulings. When we think about the single credit counterparty limit, how does this impact you? And what are you guys expecting?","John Gerspach","I'm sorry, Scott, that's one area that -- I just don't have anything prepared on that one. I haven't looked at that in the last couple of days and I'm sorry. I just can't.","Operator","Thank you, that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Kapp, do you have any closing remarks?","Peter Kapp","Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have follow-up questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us in Investor Relations. We'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"5411":["Citigroup Inc.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brian. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing.","In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a one-time gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network.","In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits.","Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex.","Turning toward our dwindling non-core assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from one year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately.","We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from one year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan.","In the past two years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from one year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns.","Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases, but the Fed has clearly been dovish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth.","John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve build this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year.","Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of one-time gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion and 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion.","On slide four, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business.","Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp\/Other.","Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region.","Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion.","Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank.","And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers.","Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.","Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter.","Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships.","Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion.","And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we\u2019ve built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly a third of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another third was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining third predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections.","In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability.","In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points.","On slide six, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a one-time gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12% respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment.","And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms.","Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time.","And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable.","On slide seven, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward.","And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period.","On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.","Slide eight shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year.","On slide nine, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year.","Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment.","In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter.","Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year.","Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed levels we saw in late 2015.","Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year.","Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves and we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations.","On slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements.","As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains.","Slide 12 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting cost related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions.","On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level.","On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding.","Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate\/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0.","Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And cost of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. First and foremost, a big-picture question. I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff. So when I look at slide 19, I want help in your words interpreting it. At Citigroup, the return on tangible is not where you want it to be, not earnings, the cost of capital. Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great.","John Gerspach ","So, I mean, Glenn, this is a perfectly fair question. What you see in Corp\/Other, I think we laid this out in some of the slides we used at the Financial Services Conference early in September. We recognized that we've got a lot of capital sitting there in Corp\/Other. Some of it is capital we're holding above what we would say is our target capital. And again, we're waiting to see where the whole CCAR process and the various rules as far as Basel III enhanced or Basel IV come out, but we recognize our debt capital there. And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom.","So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders.","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. Two small ones to follow up. Specifically, on the loan hedges in ICG, will they -- are they always going to be offsetting the positives? In other words, is that how the hedges will work? And we'll just have to deal with the negative line when things are going well? And then on securitized products that were up 40%, what specific products are there? And does it feel sustainable for now in your opinion?","John Gerspach ","Let me tackle the first question as far as -- what was the first question on the loan hedge? [indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last two years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread, larger spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last two years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future.","Mike Corbat ","And Glenn, on the spread products side of things, I think what you've seen here is the years progressed and we moved more towards a more likely shift towards higher rates. I think you've seen a relatively strong calendar on the debt issuance side, which always helps fuel secondary activity, and I think people are now focusing on positioning or repositioning their credit portfolios for an environment in the U.S. of higher rates. So again, we've beaten spread products down. There's some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers. So it's our expectation that, again, around a backdrop of a path towards slowly increasing rates and repositioning the portfolios, volumes continue to work their way back up. We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Thanks very much for that.","Mike Corbat","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. Bigger picture question on cards, guys. It's nice to see the traction on the card metrics from the investments in terms of account growth, loans and revenues. Look like they're picking up now. But as you said, you've also got this upfront investment and provisioning that you're doing. I guess, bigger picture, where are you in terms of this investment cycle in cards? And where do you see maybe an inflection point with the profits, net profits begin growing and the ROA gets closer to that targeted range that you have?","John Gerspach","Yes, it's a fair question, John. So we mentioned the fact that now we're beginning to lap some of the investment activity to grow the organic portfolio. When we brought on Costco, we said that just given the purchase accounting, Costco will not be really accretive to our earnings until sometime in the latter part of '17. It's going to take at least a full year to really get there before it gets accretive just because of the way the loan loss reserve mechanics come. So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up. I can't give you the exact timing, John, but it's sometime either in late '17 or certainly in '18. And then throughout '19, we should see a steady drive towards increased profitability coming out of the cards business.","Mike Corbat","And John, if you look at the three, in essence, things that we've been working. Again, as John mentioned, overcoming some of the regulatory headwinds that were there. We've also talked about having a number of or really all of our important renegotiations behind us, and so that's now done. And the third piece is that we've got our products in place. We've got our cash back in place. We've got our global rewards program in place, and we've built and put those out there. And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward is the increase in terms of marketing and really trying to drive volume towards and client acquisition towards those cards. And that's probably the spending that you continue to see from this point forward.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, a separate question on CCAR. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the recent proposed tweaks in CCAR. As you've discussed, John, unlocking the value trapped by DTA requires you to eventually start returning more capital than you're generating. Do you have any increased clarity or confidence after CCAR last year and then the tweaks proposed this year that you can accelerate payouts to a level of net reduction in the next year or two?","John Gerspach","So John, I'd say that everything that you saw come out from Governor Tarullo's speech, there's nothing in that speech that is inconsistent with what we want to drive towards. So we don't see any reason to think that we can't eventually get there. I think that the question is timing. And as we've said, that's something that we'll consider each year as we go through our CCAR process. You've seen us have significant increases in that capital return over the last two cycles. And that's our goal, is to continue to increase that capital return, as I think Mike said in his opening remarks.","John McDonald","Okay. But in terms of the timing, there's still some uncertainty in terms of what kind of pace that we could expect over the next year or two?","John Gerspach","Yes, I think you have to be somewhat cautious in that. We haven't seen -- we heard the speech and the tweaks. Clearly, what Governor Tarullo laid down in that speech, I would say, are manageable. There's an NPR that is going to be published early next year. I'd like to read that NPR before I made any comments, and I certainly would like to see what scenario we're going to be looking at in next year's CCAR test. So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before we gave you a specific answer on that question.","John McDonald","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe on the card business. You guys, I think, had 5% quarter-over-quarter growth in period balances. So obviously still very good momentum. Can you help us think about, was that a big flurry upfront and it's starting to slow? Or you're seeing that momentum continue? How do we think about how we think about the next quarter or two in terms of the pace of new signups?","John Gerspach","Well, when you take a look -- don't forget, there was a lot of pent-up demand in Costco as far as for new account acquisition. And clearly, with Costco not issuing cards for 6 or 7 months, we've certainly captured that. I have to admit, we've been favorably, nicely surprised by the way that the Costco portfolio has grown. We bought that -- when we took that portfolio on, it was -- it came on our books at $10.6 billion. When we reported second quarter and the first 10 days, it had grown to $11.3 billion, and now it's looking at something in excess of $14 billion. So we benefited from very strong growth in the Costco portfolio. I don't think that I'd want to say that we can expect to have that type of sequential growth out into the future, but we'd still expect that portfolio to yield very good results. And as Mike and I have both said, the portfolio performance so far, the relationship with Costco, the overall relationship is just exceeding our expectations.","Jim Mitchell","So would you say that in terms of the long-term accretion, obviously, the next few quarters, you won't see it. But long term, has it increased your expectation around accretion?","John Gerspach","I'd say that it gives us greater confidence in pointing towards that ROA target of 225-plus basis points.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Fair. And then one last question on expenses. You gave guidance for next quarter, but as we think about next year, all the puts and takes to sort of the investment spending in Mexico, continued investment spend in retail and cards, how do we think about overall? Can you still kind of get efficiency savings to kind of fund a lot of that and keep expenses reasonably flat? Or how do we think about that?","John Gerspach","Well, I don't want to commit to flat expenses yet for '17. We're going through our budget process now. I think we'll have a little bit more to say about '17 guidance when we report fourth quarter earnings. But again, we're not looking at a large-scale investment program going into next year. But there are investments that we want to make, and we think that they're important. But I -- we're not going to surprise you with some incredible amount of operating expense growth, but I'm not willing to commit to flat operating expenses at this point in time.","Jim Mitchell","That's fair. But do you think it's on the repositioning and restructuring charges, legal charges? I think we're at 500 basis points year-to-date. You guys have been targeting 200. Do we start to see some at least the repositioning stuff come down?","John Gerspach","I don't think I'm surprised that we're at -- that's not a number that --","Jim Mitchell","Maybe I'm doing the math wrong. I think that's what I calculated.","John Gerspach","Yes. I don't think so. It's in the higher 200 at this point in time. And we'll likely -- what we said that we thought that we'd be at somewhere around 200 basis points, which is kind of where we were last year. This year, given the first quarter revenues, where they were, it's likely to be a little bit higher, maybe 225. Again, I don't want to say that we're going to stay in that 200 to 225 range next year, but I certainly don't see it growing to 500 basis points, Jim. No.","Jim Mitchell","Right. I think I was doing it as a percentage of expenses. My apologies.","John Gerspach","That\u2019s okay.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good afternoon. So John, in the media call, you had indicated that the equities business could increase its ranking to number 5 or number 6 globally, which, from what I can gather, implies about $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenues versus the current run rate of about $2.8 billion. I was hoping you could speak to how you plan on closing the gap. Does it require additional investments from here as we think about the expense outlook going forward? Or can you close the gap with the current personnel and resources that you have in place right now?","Mike Corbat","Steven, it's Mike. The numbers, I would say, as we look at kind of where we are, which is in 8, 9 position going, as John described, to 5 6 is, it varies a bit by quarter and will vary a bit based on some of the volumes. We're at about $250 million of revenue per quarter, so theoretically, about $1 billion of revenue a year. We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really two key areas, one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats.","And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute. I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that in a very challenged volume market, it's tough to take share. So we're getting the right signals in terms of some of the early KPIs around broker votes, around some of the feedback of some of the services that come back and tell you your ranking. We just haven't seen that yet translating or manifesting itself into significant changes.","But I think you saw us a while back say we were going to do this in the investment bank, and we made improvements there. We said we were going to do this in the private bank, and we've made improvements there. And so this is one of those things. We're going to hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it'd probably, in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time.","Steven Chubak","Thanks, Mike. I really do appreciate all the color there. And switching gears for a moment, just moving on to the capital side. I recognize some reluctance to speak to -- speak about a proposal that is not yet official. But based on some of the guidance that have been given with this new SEB calculation, I was hoping you could clarify, based on the latest CCAR results, where you think that minimum ultimately shakes out. And then given the volatility in CCAR results year-to-year, how you're thinking about the additional cushion you might want to maintain above any designated minimum.","John Gerspach","Steven, I think that most of the analysts that published kind of captured where the SEB would turn out for us. I think most of the estimates call it less around an SEB of 270 basis points against a CCB of 250. And that's pretty much where we would put the number as well. We have not yet begun to really contemplate exactly how much cushion we need around that because, again, haven't seen the final NPR. So it's a little bit hard to talk about cushion against the speech. I'd just assume to see the rules before we actually get into public discussion about whether or not we need cushion. We also need to -- if this is the way it's going to be, you need then to also reassess just how variable those results are. So we'll look at all of those things. As I said, our initial view, based upon Governor Tarullo's speech, is that the proposal that he put forward seems to be manageable from our perspective.","Steven Chubak","All right. Thanks, John. And then just one more quick one for me on looking at the capital denominators, it looks like your leverage exposure actually increased quarter-on-quarter even as assets and RWAs are flat. And given the strength in your SLR ratios, I know you've spoken to this in the past, where you're well above designated minimums and some of your European competitors might be more constrained. Are you seeing opportunities to deploy some of that additional balance sheet towards SLR-intensive opportunities maybe on the derivatives side specifically?","John Gerspach","Yes, I wouldn't say it's focused so much on the derivatives side, but obviously, we've put some of our balance sheet capacity to work in areas like prime brokerage just to build it right back into your initial question as far as equities, where we're clearly putting more balance sheet to work there. And in this quarter, we had a little bit more, I think, increase in some of the off-balance sheet things, a few more commitments, et cetera, et cetera, but nothing staggering. And again, at 7 4, I think the word robust might even be an understatement. So --","Steven Chubak","I would agree, John. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.","John Gerspach","Not a problem, Steven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I have two questions that relate to the trade-off between results today and results in the future. And the first relates to operating leverage, which this year is negative 400 basis points according to your slide three. That would be for both Citigroup and Citicorp. On the other hand, the linked quarter progress is decent. So I'm trying to figure out how you manage that trade-off between maybe a little less investment spend a day for better earnings versus you want it to protect the future. And I think, what I heard you say is you're in the late innings for the card investments but in the early innings for additional Mexican investments.","John Gerspach","Yes, Mike, that is clearly a trade-off that we're constantly balancing. And we said going into the year that this year, because of the cards investment and the fact that the cards investments impact us both on a revenue as well as expense line, it was going to be particularly challenging this year from an operating leverage point of view. We're now -- you're now seeing the momentum come through. And again, we believe that we're going to continue to be able to share that momentum in the cards business. We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business. And even though, certainly, in Mexico, this is two quarters in a row now of positive operating leverage.","We've said that we intend to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in the fourth quarter. And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years. Now I can only say that on an annual basis, I don't think anybody commit to quarterly operating leverage. There's always one or two things that happen. But our target next year is to produce positive operating leverage for the full year in Mexico.","Mike Corbat","And Mike, on each of those, I would add to what John said. We talked about it in cards. We haven't necessary talked about it the same way in Mexico, but it holds true, that a lot of the cards spend we needed to do was catch-up, that we were in a position or weren't in a position through the crisis to be making those investments that we probably wanted to or need to, to be competitive in the U.S. And you've seen us do that. Now I would say the same largely holds true for Mexico. If you look at some of our Mexican competitors, whether they're Mexican-owned or owned by other national banks, nationalistic banks, I would argue that we've under invested in that franchise, and some of this is really catch-up. And to the latter part of your question or statement, I don't think we're necessarily forecasting that there's a lot more that we need to do from here. We think that the $1 billion over the next four years, primarily focused on technology, branches, ATMs, puts us back in a competitive position.","Mike Mayo","So do you think that Citigroup will show positive operating leverage in 2017?","John Gerspach","Mike, let us work through the budget, and then we'll talk to you when we announce fourth quarter earnings.","Mike Mayo","And then the second question relating to the trade-off between today and the future. I know you don't like having a 7.8% ROTCE or 9.2% as you show on slide 19. What about accelerating the realization of some of those disallowed DTAs by selling appreciated assets such as Mexico? I mean, one choice is to invest in Mexico. Another choice is to sell Mexico, get the gain, redeploy the proceeds and the buyback, get the certain benefit today as opposed to less certain benefit down the road.","John Gerspach","I think you framed it well in terms of today versus the future, and we remain consistently constructive in terms of Mexico at the broad level as well as our franchise in Mexico. And in a world, certainly, for my opinion, that we're growth in topline growth is going to remain tough, positions like that are to be treated well. And so we look at the intermediate to longer term prospects of our earnings and capital generation capacity or capability in Mexico as being very accretive to our shareholders. And as you've seen, we've got plenty of opportunity through our earnings and through the other things we're doing DTA and other to generate significant amounts of capital and to continue to address the denominator problem that we have in terms of continuing to take share count out.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Good morning. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just walk us through a little bit of just kind of your underlying outlook for credit outside of the comments you've made about the card normalization and just the ratios that are going to move upward as the book start to season. Can you just give us some color just maybe North America versus rest of the world? Any signals whatsoever of credit normalization? Any pockets of weakness? You did mention some GDP strengthening in a couple of specific markets. But just how does credit feel to you as you look forward?","Mike Corbat","Right now, credit feels pretty good, I have to admit. We don't see -- again, we think that rates may inch up a little bit next year, but again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest some change in the cycle at this point in time. Part of that is, again, we're focused on a very specific target client, and so we don't exactly have this broad mass-market approach in most of our businesses, which might insulate us a little bit. But at this point in time, with the underwriting practices we have in place, we feel really good about credit in North America, in Latin America, in Asia.","Ken Usdin","Okay, great. And then just on the ICG side, as far as just the business growth, loans have been certainly growing. A couple of peers are growing faster, but you have that non-U.S. business. So can you just talk about demand for credit and where you sit in terms of willingness to continue to push that directionally as well as you continue to grow treasury and trade and the other parts of ICG?","John Gerspach","Yes. I think the way, Ken, that you characterized it there is probably appropriate in that loan demand is reasonable. But again, as we think about the extension of loans, we're facilitating a client relationship with the extension of that loan. And so as our clients need to expand and grow around the world, we're there to support them. And so as you look at a business model that supports largely Fortune 500, Fortune 5000 types of companies, and you look at global growth rates in the world, I think that the growth rates we're posting there make sense. And I think within the scheme of the environments are prudent and reasonable. And I would expect to continue to see, all things considered, similar types of growth rates into next year. If you look at the world next year, growth rates globally coming up a bit with probably parts of the emerging markets rebounding better or faster than parts of the developed economies. And I would expect loan growth to largely mimic that.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Got it. Thank you, Mike","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Just a follow-up for me. John, you mentioned in the last call that the restriction in terms of taking market share or the capital restriction that we should think about is the GSIB surcharge. And in light of the continued market share opportunities and your efforts in the equities business, is there natural RWA roll-off that can continue to fund balance sheet allocation higher in ICG rather than taking it from something else that's revenue generating? I don't know if I quite articulated that question well.","John Gerspach","Well, I -- the way I'm interpreting the question is does our focus on managing to a 3% GSIB surcharge, is that going to impact our ability to seize opportunities?","Erika Najarian","Correct.","John Gerspach","Yes, and it may, and quite frankly, in some cases, if the only thing that you view is being growth is growing revenues. Again, we're focused on improving our returns, returns on assets and specifically, return on ROTCE. And so as we look about where we're going to employ capital or where we're looking at growth opportunities, we do that with a focus on improvement in each of those areas. And so far, we haven't seen anything that would indicate that we need to step outside that 3% GSIB category right now in order to seize opportunities that are accretive to our ROA and our ROTCE. So maybe we've had to reapportion capital from something that is less -- produces lower ROA or lower ROTCE in order to move it into a higher ROA or ROTCE. But we think that's the right way to manage resources.","Erika Najarian","Okay, great. And just a follow-up. I just wanted to make sure I understood your response to John's question correctly when he was asking about card. Just taking a step back, as we think about operating leverage in the North American consumer bank overall, should we interpret your answer as operating leverage is likely going to be more achievable in 2018, given the investment cycle?","John Gerspach","Yes, and I'm trying to avoid getting specific in years and everything else. We're working through a lot of that right now. But in very broad terms, yes, it will be more likely to be in '18 than it will be in '17, just given everything else. But again, I'm not able to give specifics on any year at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning. Hey, just a couple of questions. One is just to follow up a little bit on the investment spend in Mexico. I just -- I know I heard you indicate the branches and ATMs, et cetera. Is that getting it up to speed with what you've been doing globally? Or is there something else? I know that's moving it forward. Is that going to be at the cutting-edge of what you're doing globally? Maybe you could speak to also how you're tying together the network between the U.S. and Mexico as well.","Mike Corbat","Sure, I'll start. So if you look at our footprint in Mexico, we've got about 1,500 branches in Mexico today, and I'd say a lot of that investment spend, if you went down there and looked, Betsy, is getting these branches up to where they should be from an appearance, from a technology perspective. The other piece is today, we\u2019ve got about 7,500 ATMs in Mexico. We want to do two things. We not only want to move towards smart ATMs as Mexico and Mexico banking move more towards digital. We also want to increase the number of ATMs. And what we've talked about is going from 7,500 to 10,000.","And at the same time, going to the earlier part of your question, you'll see us continuing to employ our strategy around branch optimization. And the introduction of smart branches gives us that flexibility that you've seen us using in Asia, in the U.S. and other parts of the world around that. And so it's kind of a combination of those. And the other piece we talked about is the technology piece, and that technology piece really serves our ability to continue to bring the platforms of the historic Citi together with Banamex, now Citibanamex, and trying to make sure we're offering the best of each to each.","Betsy Graseck","And that's within Mexico, the Citibanamex, the Citi piece in Mexico and the Banamex piece in Mexico coming together, not Citi U.S. linked up with Mexico Banamex?","Mike Corbat","No.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then Mexico's had real-time banking for a while. I know that here in the U.S., we're beginning to launch that. I know you -- there's a press release I saw that you were going to be joining Clear Exchange. So maybe if you could speak a little bit to what your goals are there for real-time banking. And is there anything on money transfer in general between the two countries as well?","John Gerspach","Well, starting at one, I don't have the statistics in front of me. But when you look at branch transactions in Mexico and the way our customers like to bank, they're very, I guess, for lack of a better term, branch-dependent or they really favor coming into the branches. And so the move towards digital is occurring certainly slower than the U.S. or parts of Asia. But we want to make sure we're there on the forefront in terms of having that technology in place and having to have the ability to convert as people care to do that. And we think that'll continue to happen over time, although, for right now, it feels like it's certainly occurring at a slower pace than the rest of the world.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just on, like, is there anything there with money transfer between the two countries or not really?","John Gerspach","Well, of course, there's money transfer between the two countries. I don't know of anything and Clear Ex [ph] that necessarily promotes that. And obviously, around money-management across that border, you got to be smart about knowing your customer and your systems you have in place around KYC AML. And clearly, we continue to make investments on that front. And as part of not just Mexico but who we are, we are a large mover of money around the world, and certainly, Mexico's one of those places where it's the same.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","I'm actually all set. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of quickies, perhaps. John, how are you all thinking about the potential for capital markets disruption from the beginning of the Brexit negotiations? There's been a lot of commentary about potential costs, but I guess I'm just curious on the revenue side, how you are thinking about -- how that might play out over the next couple of quarters.","Mike Corbat","Matt, it's Mike. From -- we don't have a lot of answers right now. And as the Prime Minister came out, I guess, it was last week or 1.5 weeks ago, Article 50 won't be invoked until March of next year. That then starts to clock on a 2-year window. And I think it's our own belief, based on a series of elections in Europe, the combination of France and Germany, that information is probably going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded. And so what we've been working for is making sure, as that information comes out, we're in a position to continue to service our clients really no matter what. And when you think about our franchise, we not only have a sizable franchise in U.K., we also operate in 20 of the 27 EU countries.","And so we've got flexibility. We've got our passport bank already established in Ireland. We've got the pipes connected, to, certainly, the larger countries within the EU. So we've got flexibility around that. And what we've said in the meetings that I've had with both U.K. and other European officials, we're going to watch and see this unfold, but our primary goal here is to make sure that in an undisrupted way, we can continue to serve our clients. And we think our structure today gives us time and flexibility. And when the time is right, we'll make a decision of ultimately what we're going to do. But we'd like to benefit as much information as possible before we make that decision, and we just don't have it today.","Matt Burnell","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just, John, just a question on the card business and the investments you're making there. There have obviously been a couple of new products that have been either introduced or revamped in the U.S. market over the last quarter or so. I guess, I'm curious how you're thinking about the competitive landscape. And does that potentially put some greater pressure on you to increase investment relative to rewards in the card space? And does that have an effect on potential returns on that business over the next couple of years?","John Gerspach","Yes, the cards business has always been competitive. So people introducing new products is nothing new. One of the new products that got introduced appears to be an answer -- an attempt to answer how our Prestige product, which has been out there now for maybe 5 years or so, and we still think that the Prestige card that we have is a mentally strong offering and should withstand the test. So we don't see anything there in some of these new issuance, these new introductions that would cause us to change our view as to where we can drive the cards business over time.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally for me, in terms of the net interest margin, you expect that to be stable in the fourth quarter? Last quarter, you had anticipated that Costco might have a modest benefit to the margin. Where is the change in the outlook there? Is it just cash balances or is it something else?","John Gerspach","Yes, you hit it, you hit it. When we -- on the second quarter NIM, as you remember, was 286 basis points. And the guidance we put out suggested that we thought third quarter NIM could grow to 290 basis points. And as we said, embedded in this assumption was that we'd get about a 3 basis point lift from Costco. And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances. And we knew that we had a 2 basis point drag coming from the increase at a higher FDIC assessment that all the large banks got. So that's sort of how we got to the 290.","So then you ask, okay, so what actually happened? Well, we got the 3 basis points from Costco. As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too. But as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking from lowering the average cash or HQLA. And then finally, we had a 2 basis point hit with the lower NIM on our trading book. And the trading book NIM is always difficult to forecast. So 4 basis points up on loans, 2 basis points down on trading, 2 basis points down from FDIC, flat.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi. Good afternoon. I have a quick question on the Costco. You mentioned the new account openings. But can you give some color on the progression of those new account openings? Like, are you at a run rate right now where you can say this is about, on average, what we're opening per week or per month?","John Gerspach","No, I think we're still in the early days of this. Obviously, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, Costco had not been able to issue cards for 7 months or so. So there's been a large pent-up demand for these cards. So I certainly would have want to put the first 3.5 months and generating 800,000 new accounts as a new run rate. But it is -- it still is generating new accounts at a faster rate than we thought it was going to. And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more and be able to give you a better sense as to sustained run rates of growth, et cetera, over the course of the next two to three quarters. It's 1.5 quarters, not even a quarter, it's 4 months today, just about since we took over the book. And it takes a while to get into the normal rhythm so you can actually have an understanding as to the way the portfolio is going to operate. And as we develop that level of comfort and understanding, we'll be happy to provide you with more color.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then I had just one -- a different question on the -- you mentioned that there was an improvement in the yield in Asia. Can you maybe give some background on what's allowing you to have improved deal? Is it a change in geographies? Or is it just new loans coming out at higher yields?","John Gerspach","Well, again, we've been in the process of repositioning the cards portfolio in Asia. We got a lower amount of promotional balances now. So that's enabled us to -- some of that is because the promotional balances have run off, but a lot of that is because these promotional balances now have converted into full rate loans. And that is really, I'd say, the lion\u2019s share of the yield improvement that we're seeing in that portfolio.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Can you give what percentage is promotional over remaining balance?","John Gerspach","No, I can't go that deep right now. I'm sorry.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Hi. I was checking in on the DTA. It didn't seem like we get much of a pull-down in that this quarter and just was curious why not.","John Gerspach","The underlying business has used about $300 million of DTA. And then given the movement in OCI, as we saw a little bit of the impact of slightly higher rates but more important, and equally as important, the strengthening of the dollar against certain key currencies, that wiped out the -- essentially wiped out the improvement that we got in DTA from the earnings. But again, I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're doing okay and we're in line with where we said we were going to be. And don't forget, when it comes to utilizing the DTA, for us, it's really being focused on utilizing the FTCs, and we remain on track to utilizing substantial portion of the FTC this year.","Marty Mosby","CET1 kind of growth in the ratio, to kind of roll back 18 months, you were kind of increasing about 30 basis points per quarter. Last year, it was really down to about 20 basis points per quarter. And then this quarter, with the accelerated repurchase, you're down to about 10 basis points per quarter. Is that just kind of a normal progression? And as you kind of think about that, you kind of round out at around 13% and then you start to kind of stabilize. And is that just kind of a maybe just a top looking down kind of approach of kind of how you kind of seeing yourself kind of landing in that ratio?","John Gerspach","Yes, I'd say, Marty, that what you're seeing is exactly what we want to achieve over time, which is to be able to return the capital that we're generating to our shareholders. And so over time, we'd like to be able to continue to see that, again, that CET1 ratio, either staying where it is or perhaps as we get more insight into some of the CCAR rules and some of the scenarios, even have a somewhat lower CET1 ratio. I think that's consistent with our view towards increasing the amount of capital return.","Marty Mosby","And then just lastly, real quick question, on the loan loss build, loan loss reserve build in the consumer bank, you allocate most of that to Costco and to the regulatory guideline change. Could you give us a more specific number just for that? Because that really is kind of a setup in a sense of a change or unusual build that wouldn't recur as you move forward.","John Gerspach","Yes, I'd say we kind of -- we try to break that 450 build in cards out into thirds. One third was Costco. Another third was seasoning and volume growth. And then the last third was predominantly due to the impact of those regulatory guidelines. So it's something less than the 150 of the other third. If you want to think about that as being something in the 120, 110 [ph] rage, I'm not going to argue with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you guys share with us -- clearly, the oil markets have stabilized dramatically from the first quarter. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to grow the energy business at this point? Or how do you feel about your energy business, understanding that the credit has stabilized and is trying to improve in many areas?","Mike Corbat","Gerard, I'd say that, yeah, we do see some opportunities. Clearly, as oil has stabilized and stabilized somewhere around the $50 area, we've seen the combination of M&A conversations to combination of financing, refinancing conversations and overall activity and people starting to engage coming back. Again, as we've described, our customer or client base remains consistent to. We are largely a multinational, global-type client energy player throughout the vertical. And we're going to remain consistent to that. We think there's some opportunity for us to go back and you look historically, we've had a strong energy franchise.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then onto deposits. You guys saw some very good deposit growth in the ICG business in the quarter on a sequential basis. Did the change in the money market mutual funds have any impact on that growth?","Mike Corbat","Not that we can see.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then finally, John, you pointed out that the trading markets, of course, are seasonal in the fourth quarter. Last year, I think, for you, folks, it was down about just under 20%. The year before that, those numbers declined 30% sequentially. Do you have any sense on what this year is shaping up? Well, you recognize they will be down, but any magnitude?","Mike Corbat","No. I think if you look historically, you run the last two years, you'd be looking at something in the low 20% range as being kind of the norm as to whether or not this year, we're going to get that type of reduction. I don't know. But December usually is a pretty light month, and there's certainly nothing to indicate right now that, that's going to change. So I still think that you need to expect some seasonal reduction in fourth quarter trading revenues.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Appreciate the help. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I was just looking for a clarification. You had mentioned there wouldn't be positive operating leverage until 2018, but I think you're referring to a specific area as opposed to the firm.","Mike Corbat","Mike, that's exactly right. The question was had to do with North America consumer and whether or not it was more likely that we'd have positive operating leverage in '18 versus '17, okay?","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, we have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Susan Kendall","Great.

As you know, we reported earnings of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding DVA and our repositioning charge, net income was $2.2 billion, or $0.69 per share. ","These earnings were below expectations, reflecting the high level of legacy costs, most notably in legal and related expenses. We also had a reserve release which was significantly smaller than in previous quarters as our credit trends are normalizing and we\u2019ve not yet begun to release mortgage reserves.","To be clear, we\u2019re not satisfied with these bottom line earnings, and our focus is not only on putting the drag of legacy issues behind us, but also on optimizing the efficiency and returns of our business as a whole.","Despite the disappointing bottom line, our businesses generally performed well during the quarter. Investment banking increased its wallet share, loans grew in our core businesses, such as Latin American consumer, where we saw double digit growth. In addition, we decreased Citi Holdings assets by 9% during the quarter for a 31% reduction for the year. Our capital strength improved during the quarter, with the tier 1 common ratio increasing to an estimated 8.7% on a Basel III basis. ","Although the environment has shown signs of improvement, we believe it\u2019s likely to remain challenging, with continued spread compression, the introduction and implementation of new or evolving regulation, as well as the costs associated with putting legacy issues behind us. This puts even greater importance on getting our operating efficiency to a level we\u2019re satisfied with, and on allocating our resources to opportunities with the greatest risk-adjusted return. ","Regardless of the environment, Citi needs to be recognized globally as an indisputably strong and stable bank. We believe the proper essentials are the combination of a strong balance sheet, made up of high-quality assets, supported by the appropriate levels of capital and liquidity. ","Along with our risk profile, our necessary levels of capital and liquidity are a function of the consistency of the quantity and quality of our earnings, and as a company, we need to deliver on our commitments. ","When I became CEO in October, I stated three main objectives to accomplish by early in the New Year. First, conduct business reviews and prepare the 2013 budget, which drove our repositioning charge in the fourth quarter. Second was to structure my management team, which was announced on January 7, and third was to finalize and submit our CCAR, which was submitted on the same day.","Throughout this period, I spent a good amount of time meeting with stakeholders, our clients, investors, regulators, and of course our people. Let me make a few points based on those conversations. First, our strategy is to focus on our core banking businesses by trying to provide best in class products and services to people and institutions leveraging our global footprint, which includes the world\u2019s growing fastest markets and cities. We believe our strategy is aligned with the dominant secular trends.Second, we\u2019ll continue to seek ways to refine and optimize the execution of our strategy and focus on operating efficiency. As a company, we need to show expense discipline and we can be smart allocators of our resources, driving them where they can catalyze strong, risk-adjusted returns.For example, the $900 million in expense reductions we expect to realize in 2013 from the repositioning actions we announced in December, was driven by a bottoms-up review of where and how we\u2019re going to allocate our expense dollars. That said, improving our operating efficiency needs to be BAU, not just an annual event.Third, we\u2019re very focused on Citi Holdings, considering the disproportionate  drag at places on net income and returns. In 2002, we reduced the size of Citi Holdings by 31% and it now makes up 8% of our balance sheet. That being said, there is no silver bullet which will immediately resolve Holdings.We\u2019ll continue to manage these assets and our associated expenses in an economically rational way while taking advantage of any reasonable opportunities to reduce them more expeditiously.And as you know, our North American mortgage portfolio makes up the majority of Holdings\u2019 assets. Trends in that portfolio were favorable in the recent quarter and we continue to watch the US economy and housing market very closely.But before I turn it over to John, I\u2019d like to emphasize that we recognize our net income today doesn\u2019t yet reflect either the amount or caliber of earnings our shareholders expect and that our franchise is capable of. It\u2019ll take some time to work through the challenges of the current environment to realize the potential.Improving our operating efficiency, returns on assets and tangible equity in a risk-balanced manner and returning capital to our shareholders are critical goals going forward.I\u2019m a believer in you are what you measure and I intend to set clear goals and hold my management team accountable for them. Similarly, we\u2019ll share key metrics with you in the coming months so you can hold me accountable as well.Now, John will go over the slides and then we\u2019d be happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you.John GerspachThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First CVA and DVA were negative $485 million pre-tax and $301 million after tax in the fourth quarter for a negative impact on EPS of $0.10.In addition, as previously announced, we recorded a $1 billion pre-tax repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, or $653 million after tax, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.21.For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter of 2011, CVA and DVA had a minimal impact at negative $40 million pre-tax and repositioning costs were $428 million pre-tax or $275 million after tax for a total negative impact of $0.10 per share.Adjusting for these items we earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 or $0.69 per share as compared to $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our result excluding both CVA and DVA as well as the higher than normal repositioning costs in the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2012 to provide comparability to prior periods.I will also discuss prior quarters excluding the impact of gains and losses on minority investments as well as the tax benefit in the third quarter of 2012. A full schedule of repositioning charges by business is included in the appendix.In addition, as shown on Slide 4, there are a few other significant items which are included in our results.First, operating expenses in the fourth quarter included legal and related costs of nearly $1.3 billion compared to $529 million last quarter and $832 million in the prior year. Legal and related costs in Citicorp including Corp other, increased significantly from prior periods to $735 million driven primarily by U.S. consumer-related matters. And, Citi Holdings legal expenses were roughly $550 million, including the previously announced $305 million charge related to the foreclosure review settlement. Second, the net loan loss reserve release of $86 million this quarter, was significantly lower than prior periods. ","Year over year, about half of the decline in the reserve release was driven by Citicorp, mostly in North America cards, and about half was driven by Citi Holdings, reflecting declining loan and reserve balances versus last year. In Citi Holdings, we recorded a net reserve build in the fourth quarter as a significantly lower net reserve release was more than offset by the impact of losses on loan sales. This compared to a reserve release of $663 million last year.","On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $18.7 billion were up 8% from last year, while operating expenses of $12.8 billion were roughly flat as higher legal and related costs were offset by a 3% decline in core operating expenses.","Credit costs of $3.2 billion increased 11% versus last year. Net credit losses of $3.1 billion declined by 25%. However, as I just discussed, the net reserve release of $86 million was down significantly from $1.5 billion last year.","We earned $2.2 billion of net income in the fourth quarter, or $0.69 per share, up from $0.41 per share last year on a comparable basis. This was driven by loan growth, lower core operating expenses, and lower net credit losses, partially offset by the increase in legal and related expenses and a lower net loan loss reserve release.","Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year over year to $655 billion, as loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind-down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 7% to $931 billion. We saw an expected decline in deposits during the fourth quarter, reflecting the runoff of episodic deposits which came in at the end of the third quarter, as well as the expiration of the transaction account guarantee, or TAG program. This decline was partially offset by continued growth in core operating account balances.","On slide six, we show full year results, including the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing Citicorp results including our operating businesses: Global Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking, and Transaction Services, as well as the Corporate Other segment.","Full year 2012 revenues for Citigroup were $77 billion, up slightly from 2011, with less than 5% of revenues coming from Citi Holdings. Operating expenses were down 2% and credit costs also declined as a significant reduction in net credit losses was offset by a smaller loan loss reserve release in 2012 versus the prior year.","For the full year, Citigroup earned nearly $12 billion in net income, up 18% from last year. On slide 7, we show quarterly results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated fourth quarter revenues of $17.6 billion and net income of $3.2 billion. ","Year over year, revenues grew 9% and expenses were up 3% as higher legal and related costs were partially offset by a 2% decline in core operating expenses. And, for the eighth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year over year in every business in Citicorp. Total Citicorp loans grew 7%, with consumer loans up 3% and corporate loans up 11%.","Citi Holdings had revenues of $1 billion, and a net loss of $1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $156 billion of assets, down 15% during the quarter and $69 billion, or 31%, year over year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for 8% of total Citigroup assets. ","On slide eight, we show a nine-quarter trend for Citicorp\u2019s results. As I noted, Citicorp\u2019s revenues of $17.6 billion were 9% higher year over year, and down 4% sequentially, mostly reflecting seasonally lower capital markets revenues.","Expenses of $11.3 billion were up 3% from last year and 2% sequentially due to the higher legal and related costs.Citicorp\u2019s net credit losses of $2.1 billion continued to decline in the fourth quarter, down 19% from last year, driven by improvement in North America cards and the net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was $137 million, down significantly from the prior quarter and prior year, mostly reflecting a decline in the net reserve release in North America cards. Year-over-year, we grew Citicorp\u2019s earnings in every quarter of 2012.On Slide 9, we show Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings by business excluding the impact of loan loss reserves. For the full year 2012, earnings grew to just over $20 billion, up 40% from 2011, driven by consumer banking and securities and banking.Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues of $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up 3% year-over-year, largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in cards revenues. Total card revenues were down 3% from last year as lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads.Lower retail services revenues also reflected improving credit and its impact on contractual partner payments. Total operating expenses of $2.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year primarily due to efficiency savings.On a sequential basis, the increase in expenses was primarily driven by higher legal and related costs. Credit costs of $1.1 billion increased 10% year-over-year and were up 25% sequentially.Net credit losses declined by 27% year-over-year to $1.3 billion driven by improvement in cars. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower than prior periods at $215 million this quarter compared to $784 million in the prior year and $518 million last quarter.Looking ahead to 2013, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment here in the US, we expect the average quarterly net reserve releases in cards to roughly approximately the fourth quarter level.Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, nearly doubled from last year to $1.5 billion. Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the seventh consecutive quarter, up 9% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balances.In branded cards, accounts also grew for the seventh consecutive quarter, up 3% year-over-year and for both card portfolios, net credit margins continued to expand year-over-year.On Slide 11, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis, both revenues and expenses grew 4% year-over-year. In Latin America, both revenues and expenses grew 7% from last year and in AMEA, we generated positive operating leverage with revenue growth of 11% and expense growth of 5% year-over-year.In Asia, revenues were down 2% from last year while expenses were up 1%. However, on a sequential basis, revenues were flat as we began to move past the headwinds in both Korea and Japan. I\u2019ll talk more about Asia in a minute.Most drivers for international consumer banking continued to grow in the fourth quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 10% and investment sales grew 36% year-over-year.Credit costs of $869 million in the fourth quarter were up 12% from last year, driven by a 12% growth in net credit losses due mostly to loan growth as well as some specific commercial loan charge-offs in Latin American.On Slide 12, we show our Asian consumer results in a bit more detail. Total revenues remained under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the continued low rate environment and the impact of regulatory headwinds in certain markets, most notably, Korea.Our underlying business volumes, however, reflected continued franchise strength and importantly, credit performance remained very good, reflecting the high quality of our portfolio. We also maintained expense discipline across the region, while still investing in important markets such as China.","Looking first at the cards business, revenues grew 2% year over year with significant growth in card purchases. In total, purchase sales grew 8% from last year and, excluding Korea, purchase sales were up 9% versus prior periods. ","Investment sales revenue showed strong performance, up 14% year over year and down moderately from a particularly good third quarter, as retail investor sentiment improved, and we continued to attract high-quality customers. ","Revenue pressure was most evident in our retail lending and deposit businesses, down 10% year over year as spread compression offset volume growth. Volumes were muted in Korea in particular. Excluding this market, average retail loans grew 8% year over year.","Our overall outlook for Asia remains positive, and we continue to believe we can grow 2013 revenues at an annual rate of 4-6% from current levels. We also believe that longer-term, as customers become less risk-averse and interest rates normalize, revenue growth in Asia will converge with the existing driver growth and that should feed through the earnings, given our efficiency, portfolio quality, and strong market position.","Slide 13 shows our international consumer credit trends. Credit quality in our international consumer portfolio remains strong in the fourth quarter. For total international consumer banking, the NCL rate increased 17 basis points from last quarter to 215 basis points, driven by Latin America, while 90-plus day delinquencies were fairly stable at just above 90 basis points.","In Latin America, the increase in the NCL rate reflected a $50 million sequential increase in retail net credit losses. Roughly a third of this increase was related to two specific commercial loan charge offs in Mexico and the remainder primarily reflected seasoning of the portfolio, mainly personal loans in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil.","In Latin America, we expect retail banking NCL rates should normalize in the range of 2.5% by the second half of 2013. The card NCL rate in Latin America remains stable in the fourth quarter at 7.7%. However, we would expect this portfolio to normalize to a level of around 8.5% in 2013 as the portfolio seasons. ","On a combined basis, therefore, we expect the NCL rate in Latin America to normalize in the range of 4.5% by the second half of 2013, based on what we see today. In Asia, both the NCL and delinquency rates remained fairly stable at 1% and 50 basis points, respectively. ","Slide 14 shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $4.8 billion grew 47% from last year, and were down 14% from the prior quarter, on seasonally lower capital markets revenues. Investment banking revenues of $996 million grew 56% from the prior year and 8% sequentially, with higher revenues in all major products.","Overall, our wallet share in investment banking improved this year in most products and regions. Equity market revenues of $455 million nearly doubled from last year, driven by improved derivatives performance as well as the absence of the prior period\u2019s proprietary trading losses. However, sequentially, equity market revenues were down 11% on lower derivatives revenues.","Fixed income market revenues of $2.7 billion grew 58% from last year, driven by significant improvement in credit and securitized products as well as higher revenues in rates and currencies. Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 27% from a strong third quarter.","Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $397 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% from last year, on higher loan balances and improved spreads, and down 11% sequentially on loan sale activity.","Total operating expenses of of $3.4 billion were down 2% from last year driven by efficiency savings.Credit costs were $78 million in the fourth quarter and net income grew substantially year-over-year to $1.1 billion.Moving now to transaction services on Slide 15, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year. Treasury and trade solutions was up 1% year-over-year driven by continued growth in deposits and trade loans partially offset by ongoing spread compression and securities and fund services revenues were flat to last year as growth in fee revenues was also offset by continued spread compression.The drivers for transaction services continued to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up 24% from the prior year. Average deposits were up 16% and assets under custody grew by 10%.Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 2% from last year due mostly to higher legal and related costs as well as certain episodic items, which also drove part of the increase from the prior quarter.We experienced negative operating leverage in transaction services in the fourth quarter, reflecting both spread compression in revenues and the increase in expenses. While we currently expect client volumes to continue to grow, revenue pressure from spread compression is likely to persist in the near term.Quarterly expenses, however, should be somewhat lower than fourth quarter 2012 levels as we go forward. As such, we expect to return to positive operating leverage in transaction services on a full-year basis in 2013.Slide 16 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues of negative $76 million were down from the prior year driven by the absence of last year\u2019s hedging gains and lower investment yields.Expenses of $805 million were significantly higher versus last year, mainly due to higher legal and related expenses. Assets of $249 billion included approximately $46 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $144 billion of liquid available for sale securities.Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings\u2019 assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $156 billion in Citi Holdings or roughly 8% of total Citigroup assets. The $15 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales, $10 billion of net paydowns and roughly $1 billion of cost of credit.On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings\u2019 financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1 billion were down 2% year-over-year, as declines in local consumer lending were largely offset by higher revenues in the special asset pool reflecting an improvement in asset marks.Citi Holdings\u2019 expenses were down 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion mostly due to the reduction in assets and on a sequential basis the increase mostly reflects the $305 million charge related to the foreclosure review settlement.Credit costs increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Total net credit losses of $972 million were down 36% year-over-year. However, we recorded a net loan loss reserve build in the fourth quarter as a significantly lower net reserve release was more than offset by the impact of losses on loans sets. This compared to a net reserve release of $663 million last year.Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings\u2019 results on Slide 19, rep and warranty reserve builds, legal and related costs and repositioning charges continued to weigh on Citi Holdings in the fourth quarter.On an operating basis, however, excluding these items, we maintained a modest positive operating margin again in the fourth quarter and our goal is to continue to generate positive margins, although there may be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations arising from periodic gains or losses as we continue to wind down the assets.Credit trends remain favorable this quarter with North America mortgages comprising 75% of total net credit losses. We ended the quarter with $8.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings, or 33 months of loss coverage. On slide 20, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 27%, driven by $19 billion of paydowns, $6 billion of asset sales, and $9 billion of net losses.","In the recent fourth quarter, we sold nearly $600 million of delinquent loans. We have also significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 40% since the fourth quarter of 2010 to $762 million, even while roughly $60 million of losses were accelerated into the recent quarter as a result of the continued actions we are taking to fulfill our commitments under the National Mortgage Settlement, or NMS. We currently expect NMS to continue to have an impact on net credit losses through the second quarter of 2013. ","Delinquency trends improved as well through the fourth quarter, in both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Assuming the continuation of the current economic environment here in the U.S., the net credit losses on these portfolios should generally decline over time, as the portfolio continues to shrink.","On slide 21, we show our net interest margin and revenue trends. Our net interest margin expanded in the fourth quarter by 7 basis points to 2.93%, with about half of the improvement driven by our trading book and the remainder reflecting lower funding costs, partially offset by lower loan yields. Net interest revenue also increased from last quarter, as growth in Citicorp net interest revenue offset the ongoing wind-down of Citi Holdings. ","On a full year basis, our net interest margin remained relatively stable versus last year at 288 basis points. And, we currently believe we can maintain our net interest margin at roughly this level for 2013, with some quarterly fluctuations.","Turning to total Citigroup expenses, on slide 22, while reported operating expenses of $13.8 billion in the fourth quarter were 5% higher than last year, core operating expenses, excluding legal and related costs and repositioning charges, declined 3% in constant dollars to $11.5 billion.","We currently believe $11.5 billion is an indicative base for quarterly operating expenses going into 2013. From this level, Citi Holdings expenses should decline over time with the ongoing reduction in assets. We will continue to pursue ongoing reengineering opportunities and we continue to expect to achieve $900 million of expense savings in 2013, related to our announced repositioning actions, with full year expense savings of $1.2 billion beginning in 2014.","These total expense savings will likely be offset in part by volume-related costs, particularly as we seek to grow client volumes in the low interest rate environment. Overall, however, we expect core operating expenses in 2013 to be lower than full year 2012. Of course, legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile, although we would not expect our fourth quarter levels to be the new norm.","On slide 23, we show our key capital metrics through the fourth quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier 1 common ratio increased to 8.7% versus 8.6% in the third quarter. And, our Basel I tier 1 common ratio remained flat at 12.7%. Adjusting for the final market risk rules that became effective this month, our Basel I tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 11.2%. ","In summary, our results in the fourth quarter reflected the challenging operating environment as we faced elevated legal and related costs and continued spread compression, particularly in the U.S. and Asia. In consumer banking, we continued to see strong loan growth in Latin America, and in Asia we began to move past some of the regulatory headwinds which slowed volumes in the second half of the year.","Importantly, the credit trends in our global consumer portfolio remained favorable with net credit losses and delinquencies at historically low levels. In securities and banking, we demonstrated our ability to grow revenues while maintaining expense disciplines and our investment banking franchise showed good progress.And finally, in transaction services, we faced a continued low interest rate environment in many local markets but we showed positive operating leverage for the year as higher volumes offset spread compression.We continued to reduce Citi Holdings, which represented only 8% of total assets at year-end. We also ended the year with demonstrated strength in both capital and liquidity.As we go into 2013, we are keenly aware of the challenging rate environment but remain positive in our ability to grow volumes to offset this headwind given our unique global footprint.We are also highly focused on efficiency and optimizing our core businesses in order to drive improved returns. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.Question-and-Answer Session","Operator[Operator instructions] \u00a0Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.Glenn Schorr \u2013 NomuraI guess, John, you gave some good detail on some of the improving credit trends in Holdings and the mortgage portfolio. I guess the blunt question \u2013 I know we\u2019ve asked it in the past \u2013 is what more do you need to see to start freeing up the reserves? \u00a0It\u2019s $8.4 billion, you have 33 months now. It\u2019s a big difference because it goes hand in hand with the question of how do we get that P&L impact of Holdings lower. So just curious on your thoughts there.John GerspachGlenn, your observations are absolutely right as far as \u2013 and we\u2019ve pointed this out before - as far as being able to begin charging those [NCLs] [ph] against the reserve is one way of driving Holdings towards breakeven.But as we\u2019ve said last quarter, we want to make sure that those trends \u2013 and we do see some strong positive trends in the housing market. We want to make sure that they are sustainable.And at the end of last quarter, we pointed out to we wanted to see the US get past the whole fiscal cliff issue. Well, unfortunately at the end of the year, the resolution of the fiscal cliff was basically kicking the can down the road. So I think that what we would like to see now is how the US deals with the ongoing debt ceiling debate and the upcoming sequester on expense reductions.We get through that, and we see how the economy performs, we see whether or not the trends that we see now are sustainable and then we\u2019ve got decisions to make.Glenn Schorr - NomuraCrystal ball, that\u2019s a 2013 event though?John GerspachYou tell me how we\u2019re going to come through the debt ceiling\u2026Glenn Schorr - NomuraThey\u2019re going to put another band aid on it.John GerspachWe\u2019ll take a look.Glenn Schorr - NomuraThe $10 billion in paydowns this quarter that you mentioned, is that \u2013 are there specifics to the portfolio that would make fourth quarter more or less or is $10 billion a quarter fair enough to think about?John GerspachGlenn, I just want to make sure that we\u2019re focused on the same items. When we were talking about that net pay downs, that\u2019s not the overall in the mortgage portfolio. I don\u2019t know if you\u2026Glenn Schorr - NomuraI\u2019m with you, correct, but it\u2019s inside Holdings\u2019 assets, correct?John GerspachYes, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. Look, we\u2019ve guided you for some time now that the pace of reduction in Holdings is going to slow and it won\u2019t necessarily be smooth quarter-after-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t look at that $10 billion of net paydowns necessarily as being indicative. But we don\u2019t anticipate that it should drop off dramatically in the next quarter or two.Glenn Schorr - NomuraIn the back end \u2013 in Slide 26 in the appendix, you gave us the Basel I to Basel III walkthrough and I guess there\u2019s a 24% increase when you go from one to the other. And that\u2019s been consistent.What we\u2019ve seen at some of the competitors is as portfolios have reduced and as credit has continued to get better, some changes to the models and therefore Basel III assets go down, therefore your Basel III cap ratio goes up. Curious on what would be different on Citi\u2019s portfolio that we wouldn\u2019t see something similar.","John Gerspach","Assuming that we continue to reduce the risk in the portfolio, and if there\u2019s an improving environment that is the way the model should work. ","Glenn Schorr - NomuraSo, bottom line, is at year end you didn\u2019t make big changes to the models for what you\u2019ve seen on credit, and so therefore no big reduction of Basel III. ","John Gerspach","No, no. The reductions that you see in Basel III primarily reflect, again, movement in the actual books themselves.","Glenn Schorr - NomuraI appreciate that. One last quickie is you mentioned on the $1.3 billion of legal costs this quarter related to some consumer matters. I wouldn\u2019t mind just a little bit more color there. This way we can make our own decisions on whether or not we think that\u2019s the appropriate run rate or if fourth quarter was unusually high. ","John Gerspach","We don\u2019t go into detail on specific reserving actions unless it\u2019s in connection with a settlement that we\u2019re announcing. But look, many different aspects of U.S. consumer-related products and offerings are the focus of reviews across the industry, including by several of our regulators. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret that the CFPB has been reviewing various consumer products, and in fact they\u2019re currently reviewing us. But I\u2019m really not going to say anything more about individual regulator discussions.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, John, a couple of clarifying questions about your outlook comments. You indicated that you hope to keep the net interest margin stable. Would that imply that you expect to have some expansion of net interest income dollars given that the balance sheet is growing?","John Gerspach","The answer to that is it somewhat depends. I\u2019m going to have fudge this a little bit, only because of the impact of the trading book, and how that impacts net interest. So when you look at our core banking operation, we should have some improvement in net interest revenue. The difficult thing to project, always though, is the exact movements of net interest revenue, and therefore NIM, on the trading book. In this quarter, for instance, I mentioned roughly half, 4 basis points, of the 7 basis point improvement came about as a result of the trading portfolio. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And then on the expense outlook, you said core operating expenses should be trending at the $11.5 billion per quarter? Right? ","John Gerspach","I said that that\u2019s a good base on which to start to think about it. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And for the year, you expect that core operating expense to be lower in 2013 versus \u201912. What\u2019s the amount in \u201912 you are looking at when you say it will be below that? ","John Gerspach","Take a look at the full year reported operating expenses for Citigroup. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Do you have the number that you\u2019re looking at? ","John Gerspach","I think there\u2019s a slide in the appendix. How about 29? So it\u2019s 46.3. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","So you expect the core operating expense to come in below that in \u201913. That\u2019s what you\u2019re shooting foreign. And that\u2019s before the $900 million in repositioning saves? ","John Gerspach","I rolled it all together. I\u2019m trying to stay away from giving you a specific number. But think in terms of the 11.5, as I said, as being an indicative base for moving forward. Off that 11.5 base, we\u2019re going to deliver the $900 million of expense saves coming off of the repositioning. ","We\u2019re going to drive down expenses in Citi Holdings. We\u2019re going to have to spend some amount of money off of those two reductions in order to fuel volume growth that we\u2019ll see in the business, but we\u2019re also anticipating continuing our reengineering program and therefore driving up more expenses on top of the $900 million. ","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And then finally, we heard you say legal and related costs a lot today as you went through your remarks. And just a little bit of color on what\u2019s included in that type of category, because there was a lot of expense increase in this quarter attributed to legal and related. And what are your thoughts as we go through? It\u2019s obviously tough to predict this stuff, but do you expect to make some improvement on that front in \u201913?Mike CorbatWell, as I said, we don\u2019t \u2013 legal and related \u2013 let\u2019s see, what does this include? \u00a0Let me get to one of your specific questions.It certainly includes the results of announced settlements. We can call that out for you just as we did with the $305 million settlement that we reached in connection with the foreclosure review, so, right. It would include other reserves that we take in relation to ongoing legal and regulatory matters for which we don\u2019t comment because there just \u2013 we\u2019re not going to comment on publicly until they become a fact.So given that, those are the types of items that you look at and given the environment that we\u2019re in, that\u2019s why we would expect legal and related expenses to remain somewhat elevated as we move forward.Legal and related for this year ran about $2 billion plus and closer to $3 billion, $2.9 billion. It\u2019s a $600 million or $700 million increase off of where we were last year. I think you\u2019re going to be looking at those types of levels going \u2013 at least in the near term.John McDonald - Sanford BernsteinAnd one final specific question, can you tell us how much you had in expenses related to mortgage look backs and that might be ending with the independent foreclosure review settlement?Mike CorbatYes, one of the good things coming out of that settlement is that we can stop incurring those expenses. Those expenses were running us just south of $200 million a year.John McDonald - Sanford BernsteinAnd were they disproportionately in Holdings?Mike CorbatThey were all in Holdings.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham ResearchCan I ask about the LCR? \u00a0You guys have disclosed in the past that you, even under the more stringent criteria, you had I think in the third quarter, 116% LCR. With the new changes, have you had a chance to look at that and the way you might be in it? \u00a0Does that give you an opportunity to free up some cash?John GerspachThat\u2019s a very timely question. Actually, during the quarter, we actually did reduce the amount of excess cash that we were carrying towards the end of the quarter.Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham ResearchYes, that was my next question, thanks.John GerspachSo whereas we were running levels of a little bit north of $400 million, we\u2019re currently at about a $350 billion level on the excess cash. But even at that reduced level, under the new rules, we\u2019re running an LCR ratio of something to the tune of \u2013 it\u2019s either 116% or 118%. So we still think that we are certainly in compliance with the new rules as fully rolled out as we understand them.Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham ResearchAnd so when we look at your balance sheet down \u2013 on a period-end basis, down $70 billion, is that a function of the fact that you used a lot of that cash to pay down debt? \u00a0Obviously you did have some decline in City Holdings as well but was a good chunk of that used to pay down debt?John GerspachYes, a fair chunk of that went to pay down debt. We also had, as we said, some deposit runoff, largely the runoff of those episodic deposits that we talked about coming in to us at the end of the third quarter.And then we also made some additional investments available for sales securities. So I\u2019d say roughly on the $60 billion it\u2019s probably 50% going towards long-term debt, 25% is the deposit rundown and 25% or thereabouts on the growth in AFS securities.Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham ResearchThen maybe the last one I guess I\u2019ll take a shot at capital return. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of chatter. You can\u2019t really say exactly but can you maybe discuss maybe a just broader view of how you think about the (C-card)?Mike CorbatThe way we approached (C-card) was probably not surprising to most. It\u2019s really job one or mission one really to put a submission in there where we could get approval. And so we\u2019re obviously focused on doing that. I think second thing we were focused on is in 2013 giving ourselves the goals of getting to and breaking a 9.5% Basel III tier common ratio.And so I think those two things were the guiding principles of our submission and I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","It sounds like you\u2019re not ready to comment on future cost saves, although there was a comment earlier that some additional efficiencies should be coming. So I do want to just prod a little bit there. As we think about the $1 billion or so of savings that you disclosed last month, is that kind of a downpayment on something that\u2019s going to be pretty big? Or is this a pretty big chunk of what the overall pie might be? ","Mike Corbat","Matt, I think that what you described as the downpayment was as I described the results of our budget process, and I think as we went through the budget, we came to some conclusions that we had expenses, people, businesses in places that we didn\u2019t think we were going to be able to earn the requisite returns on those businesses over the intermediate period, and chose and made decisions to exit, downsize, rescale those activities.","I think as an institution, and you heard me mention it, that from an operating efficiency perspective our businesses and geographies need to be focused, really BAU, on the way they think about and run their businesses. ","And so we\u2019re trying to drive, as we come out of this budget process, a mentality that rather than having one-off events or annual events around repositioning charges, people need to have specific metrics by which they\u2019re going to be held accountable for delivering against their businesses and that they need to make real-time decisions in terms of how they choose to make that happen. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And in terms of the timing of some of the metrics that you\u2019ll provide us and I guess just kind of the overall strategy review -- I can appreciate you\u2019re a couple of, or a few, months into this -- what\u2019s the timing of that in terms of when you\u2019ll communicate to investors and the Street? ","Mike Corbat","You know, we\u2019re working through it, and I think over the next coming months we\u2019re going to come out with that. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And I realize it\u2019s still being formed, but as we think about which metrics are important to you, I\u2019m not going to pin you to the level, but in terms of whether it\u2019s the ROA, the ROE, the efficiency, or all of them, are there a couple of key ratios that you think about?  ","Mike Corbat","Yeah, in my opening remarks I mentioned a few that I think are critical and my guess is as we refine this we\u2019ll speak to\u2026 In no particular order, I\u2019ve mentioned operating efficiency. I think ROA is one of those things I think that return on tangible common equity is a ratio that we should probably be out speaking and measuring ourselves to. ","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And then just lastly, maybe a question for John. If we look at some of the capital markets revenues and I guess specifically [thick], I think last quarter you had a very good quarter and maybe the first three quarters you gained a lot of share. And it seems like at least so far, as we have seen report this quarter, you might have given back a little bit this quarter. Is there something different in your mix, because it\u2019s more global, or just a product set, that maybe explains some of the relative weakness in 4Q?","John Gerspach","I wouldn\u2019t call it a weakness in the fourth quarter at all. I actually think we had a very good fourth quarter in our [thick] business. And I think that for the full year, you\u2019ve got [thick] revenues up 28%. That\u2019s good performance. And I think that that ongoing performance, you know, reflects a lot of the repositioning that we did in the business in 2011. ","So, relatively speaking, we probably had more of an outperformer in the third quarter and therefore it makes the fourth quarter -- you know, when you\u2019re doing quarterly sequential comparisons -- look a little small therefore. But I think that if you judge the year in its entirety, that\u2019s really the way to look at the business. And I think the business had an excellent 2012.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Just wanted to follow up first on something Glenn hit on, the reserves and holdings. And I just want to make really clear, there\u2019s nothing that you\u2019re seeing there in the data -- given your comments, John, I wouldn\u2019t assume so, but just want to make sure here -- that would be preventing you from releasing any reserves there?","John Gerspach","I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we feel pretty good about the underlying credit data in that mortgage book. Delinquencies continue to improve, the NCLs, as you can see, continue to go down. We put up some data for you at the financial services conference I spoke about in December, that point to some of the improvements that we see in the portfolio related to the dollars and the percentage of the portfolio, FICO scores over 660 and the amount of loans that had either FICO scores less than 580 or an LTV over 100%. And all of those trends are showing favorable movement. So the book looks pretty good.Brennan Hawken - UBSYes, agreed. It just seems \u2013 and then you combine that with the home price improvements that we\u2019ve seen now over the last three quarters. It just seems really odd that we would get some reserve release.Dysfunction in Washington is something that we\u2019re probably going to be able to count on until we normally would have been able to like Social Security. God knows whether that will happen.So it\u2019s just \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s really preventing the releases there, especially giving the ETA.Mike CorbatIf we end up with a sustainable stalemate that then produces a sustainable trend, maybe that\u2019ll give us the basis then to make some other decisions.Brennan Hawken - UBSAnd then could you quantify the impact that the loan sale had on the Holding reserve bill this quarter? \u00a0It sounds like there was a little bit of noise there.Mike CorbatYes, it was a little over $100 million worth of losses that we took, net losses that we took on loan sales in the quarter and that flows into that LLR line.Brennan Hawken - UBSThen also on reserve, in Asia, we switched to a build there. Are we seeing a cyclical \u2013 any reason to believe that that\u2019s now a cyclical shift where there will be some build for a while or is that more one-time in nature.Mike CorbatI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one-time but I think if you look at Asia over the last three or four quarters, we\u2019re bouncing around a level of reserves. I think we had a reserve build in Asia. I can\u2019t remember if it was the first quarter or the second quarter.Then we had some small releases. Now we\u2019ve got a small build. So I would just look at it as fine tuning the reserve levels.Brennan Hawken - UBSThen just a couple quick ones on cap markets. You guys don\u2019t provide comp ratios in securities and banking but when you look at the expense ratio delta, it didn\u2019t show the improvement there that some of the peers, particularly those reporting yesterday, showed.Could you give some color on what\u2019s going on? \u00a0Is there any reason why those would diverge or is there any noise that might imply the actual trends didn\u2019t diverge as much as the reported numbers would imply?John GerspachI think what you have \u2013 when you take a look at the business, you have to take a look at the full-year results in order to really get a true measure of performance and I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t have the full-year securities and banking numbers in front of me, ex-CVA and everything else.But I believe that we did show improvement in the efficiency ratio in securities and banking during the course of the year and I think even now, if you just take a look at securities and banking, our efficiency ratio compares pretty well with the efficiency ratios of some of our peers.Having said that, and as Mike indicated in his opening remarks, we\u2019re still not satisfied with where we are and we intend to drive for improvements in efficiency ratios in all of our businesses.Brennan Hawken - UBSThen last one, the DCM pipeline, can you maybe give some color on where that stands for you guys? \u00a0We had a pretty terrific end of the year. Are we going to be looking at a typical sequential uptick here as we head into the typically seasonally strong 1Q?John GerspachI really can\u2019t comment on the pipeline at this point in time. I\u2019m sorry.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan StanleyA couple of questions \u2013 one, at a recent conference I think you mentioned a mid-term goal on ROTCE of about 10% and I was wondering if you could give us some color, clarity behind timing on that and how much the announced changes that you\u2019ve made get you to that goal?John GerspachI think that we would wrap up the timing on \u2013 more specific timing on that - in Mike\u2019s opening comments were, over the next coming months, we\u2019ll get you more specifics on that goal as well as improvements in ROA and operating efficiencies.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then on the comments around investing to get the revenue share that you\u2019re looking for, how do you think through the timing? Just as you go throughout the year in 2013, you generate the expense saves and the $900 million that you discussed, and then you\u2019re investing that along the way or are you needing to see some revenue improvement first to have business units self-invest?  ","Mike Corbat","I think when we talk about operating efficiency, Betsy, it\u2019s the want to have the balance between a strong focus on expenses but understanding that you can\u2019t cut yourself to where you need to be, and that we have businesses we need to make investments in, but understanding that expenses are the things that you can control. So we\u2019re going to be looking across the company in terms of where and how we make those investments, and we\u2019re going to have a set of parameters and an understanding around those investments as they come for people to make them. But we need to be in a position to be able to make those on a regular basis and drive that in a BAU way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America. ","Erika Penala - Bank of America ","My first question is actually a follow up to Matt and Betsy\u2019s questions. Mike, specifically regarding GCB in Asia and Lat-Am, we appreciated John\u2019s comments with regards to revenue growth potentially starting to converge into earnings growth in Asia. And now we have a public comparable in terms of looking at credit growth trends in Mexico now that Santander is public. I guess I\u2019m wondering, have you gotten a chance to evaluate whether or not the infrastructure in those two regions are right-sized to potentially reap the revenue acceleration? Or is it still sort of unwieldy relative to the secular changes of retail banking generally? And tell me if you need clarity on the last part of the question. ","Mike Corbat","I think if I understand your question right, I think Erika it\u2019s important to understand the way we think about, and the way we\u2019ve asked Manuel to drive our consumer business, and that is that we operate a consumer business in roughly 40 countries around the world, and that we recognize that aside from a few individual countries, our scale is not going to come from any one particular country, that our scale has got to be driven on a global basis. ","So as we think about our lending platforms, our card platforms, the mundane things of account openings, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the systems and the way we approach things allows us to recognize that scale on a global basis. So I don\u2019t think of our consumer business as being constrained in the intermediate term in terms of any individual geographies but it\u2019s making sure that we have this drive to come in on our platform so that that can occur. I\u2019m not sure if that answers your question. ","Erika Penala - Bank of America ","I guess, just to be clear, there are not any additional investments that you would have to make in specific countries in those regions. I know you\u2019re focusing on China, but in Mexico, for example, to reap sort of the credit growth and the revenue growth, if the Mexican economy is picking up as much as folks down there are saying. There\u2019s no additional reinvestment coming? ","Mike Corbat","We\u2019ve been making investments. You know, we started making reasonable investments into Asia last year, and around the world -- Asia, Mexico, and other places. We\u2019ve continued to invest and I expect we\u2019ll continue to invest in some of those higher-growth areas into the future. ","Erika Penala - Bank of America ","Okay. And just a quick one that\u2019s not on Holdings reserves. If I look at the provision levels in GCB North America, it was up quarter over quarter, but flattish year over year. Is the bump up just simply seasonal as the volume spend is higher in the fourth quarter, and could potentially come down on a dollar level in the first quarter?  ","John Gerspach","You\u2019re talking about the overall provision, or just the NCL rate, I just want to make sure\u2026? ","Erika Penala - Bank of America ","The overall provision in GCB North America. ","John Gerspach","Yeah, see when you get into the overall provision, then you get a little bit into loan loss reserve releases. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about the credit losses, separate from loan loss reserve releases. Because I think we\u2019ve given you the guidance on the loan loss reserve releases that specifically in cards going forward, we would expect the loan loss reserve releases to be roughly at the level where we are in the fourth quarter, at least into 2013.When you take a look at the NCL rates, though, the net credit losses have been improving, the net credit loss rate has been improving in both our branded and our retail services portfolios throughout the year.We\u2019ve now got \u2013 I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me \u2013 but we\u2019ve got a 3.92, or something like that, NCL rate in branded cards. That\u2019s pretty low. I would anticipate that you\u2019ll see some increase in that rate during 2013 just because it\u2019s at a historically low level.I think even in 2013 you\u2019re looking at a level that\u2019s going to be in the low fours. So we\u2019re not looking for some change in the underlying credit dynamics of either of our card portfolios.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA.Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSAJohn, if you could just clarify, what was the return on tangible equity for Citigroup, however you look at it, excluding all the noise? \u00a0What was ROTE for last year or the fourth quarter or both?John GerspachWell, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have that number, Mike. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s somewhere in the 5% range, I believe, for the full firm, for the full year. I just don\u2019t have the specifics.Mike Mayo - CLSAAnd assume it\u2019s 5% for the whole firm, what would it be just for Citicorp?John GerspachWe don\u2019t break out TC. We don\u2019t apportion the TCE as you know to the various operating segments.Mike Mayo - CLSAAnd John, just in very simple terms, maybe as a summary comment, your reserve release declined from around $900 million down to $100 million or $0.19 down to $0.02. Why was reserve release so much less?John GerspachUnfortunately, Mike, it\u2019s not going to be a very simple comment. But I guess if I was going to break it down, it would be that there were some episodic releases in the third quarter which did not repeat. Don\u2019t forget in the third quarter we called out that we had a $600 million reserve release in that third quarter specifically related to increased net credit losses that we were \u2013 that the rest of the industry was forced to incur by some new guidance issued by the OCC.The loan loss reserve release associated with cards has been tracking down, as we talked about. I think if you take a look at the cards book, we released about $800 million of reserves in the second quarter, about $550 million in the third quarter and now we\u2019re down in that $200 million to $300 million range in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s where we think we\u2019re going to be going forward.So we reached where we\u2019re going to be in cards. The rest of it is just a lot of individual noise around the portfolio. Take a look at international consumer. Our international consumer, we had a $100 million net reserve build in that business in the quarter. That\u2019s due to the growth in those portfolios.So unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a one sentence answer that I can give you on that. It\u2019s just a collection of how we take a look at \u2013 it\u2019s a collective view and an individual view of each portfolio.Mike Mayo - CLSAAnd then for Mike, I asked this question when you first got the CEO job. If in five years from now you were to look back at your performance, what would you want to see to show that you were successful?Mike CorbatI think probably going back to your first line of questioning, we\u2019ve got to get to a point where we stop destroying our shareholders\u2019 capital. I would say that would certainly be at the top of the list, that we run a smart and efficient business that\u2019s good at its allocation of its resources around its customer and client segments, that it\u2019s continued to have the ability to lead in a company those clients around the world, that it served the social purpose. There\u2019s several things in there.Mike Mayo - CLSAAnd then for us, the investors, I guess that, in turn, would lead to a higher stock price. Is that I guess a secondary focus to do everything else right?Mike Corbat","I wouldn\u2019t call it a secondary focus. We understand why we come to work, and it\u2019s a primary focus.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","The reason I ask, I mean as a new CEO, you have so many options of what you could do with the stock price. You could have all the directors take a lot of stock, and you\u2019ve had some CEOs take their personal net worth and buy extra stock, and as investors I think that\u2019s a huge focus. I guess whenever you\u2019ve done your review, perhaps we\u2019d hear more about what you might do along those lines. Is that a safe assumption? ","Mike Corbat","Yes. ","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay. And would you ever consider having a target of where you\u2019d want the stock price to be? In other words, if you\u2019re looking for higher returns on equity, and you get the business mix that you ultimately want, and the efficiency and the capital allocation, would you have a target in mind? Or is that just left up to the stock market to kind of let the valuation fall wherever it will? ","Mike Corbat","I think we need to look at all the metrics that are out there. You talked to one of the challenges of that particular metric in terms of how the market is approaching certain things, but it\u2019s obviously something we need to keep in mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Can you share with us on the sale of the assets out of Citi Holdings the pricing trends that you\u2019re seeing compared to the sales of the delinquent mortgage sales, for example, that you\u2019ve sold in the past? I think through the third quarter it was over $14 billion. Are you seeing better pricing now that the markets have improved a bit? ","Mike Corbat","Pricing did improve slightly in the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll tell you that. I wouldn\u2019t say that it went up by leaps and bounds, but it definitely improved over the levels, certainly, that we saw at the beginning of the third quarter. I\u2019d say the pricing on some of those asset sales improved toward the end of the third, and then held up in the fourth, is the way that I would characterize it. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Okay, and did you finance any of the sales of the assets in the quarter? ","Mike Corbat","No. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Would that be a consideration of yours on a go-forward basis, to help accelerate the disposition of some of those assets? ","Mike Corbat","Actually we\u2019ve done that in the past, if you look at some of the deals that we\u2019ve announced. We\u2019ve actually taken on those financings, in certain amounts, in order to make sure that the deals would go. So that is not something that we would shy away from. Again, it\u2019s a matter of being the right deal, the right price. Think in terms of what we always say, economically rational. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Sure. Shifting away for a moment to the net interest margin, your interest-bearing liability cost in the quarter, when we look at it with and without the FDIC insurance, is higher than some of your competitors. Is there an opportunity to bring those costs down, or is it just because of your global footprint, you just need to pay higher costs in markets outside the U.S.? ","Mike Corbat","I think that we, especially on the international deposits, I still think that we\u2019ve got some opportunity. We\u2019ve probably got some more opportunity on the international deposits to bring some pricing down than we do on the domestic deposits. As long as we stay in low interest rate environments in those countries, I do think that we\u2019ve still got some opportunities. We continue to reposition those books away from time deposits. ","So if you take a look at what goes on in Asia in particular, or specifically, even what we would consider to be normal checking accounts here in the States, which don\u2019t bear interest, a lot of the checking accounts in foreign countries do bear interest. So as you start to grow those checking balances, you\u2019re going to, even though they\u2019re operating accounts, see an increase in your interest bearing. ","The trick is to make sure that you\u2019re growing the real operating accounts and shifting the mix away from time deposits, which have much higher rates than just the base checking account. So even within something that gets reported as interest bearing deposits, there\u2019s a mix shift that you can still work on, and we\u2019re certainly in the process of doing that. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","And one last question on the balance sheet. What\u2019s the duration now of the securities portfolio, in years? ","Mike Corbat","I\u2019ll focus on the AFS portfolio that we sort of use for the excess liquidity. I think we used to say it was slightly under two years. Now I would characterize  it as being slightly over two years but it\u2019s still roughly in that two-year tenor.Gerard Cassidy - RBCThen one final question for Mike, in looking at over the next two to three, maybe even five years, when you look to increase shareholders\u2019 wealth, is there \u2013 would you consider every spinning off or selling parts of some of your assets such as your bank in Mexico, for example.We all know how well Mexico\u2019s doing and it doesn\u2019t seem like Citigroup is getting enough credit for its position down there. How do you try to capture those assets that might not be recognized today by the market?Mike CorbatI think when you look at the way we come to work, we think our strength comes from our global network and the interconnectivity of our network and our ability, as we\u2019ve described it, to lead in a company our clients and customers around the world and that\u2019s products, that\u2019s businesses. And we think that the value lies in that, point one.Point two, I\u2019d say that in many ways, our model is becoming more unique and has the ability to even become more valued over time. So if you look at where I just came from in Europe to deleveragings, regulation in many cases are \u2013 in some cases are forcing some firms to abandon global strategies, in some cases to abandon regional strategies.And I think that the importance of a bank that can do the things that we do for its global clients is only becoming more valuable and we think that the future lies in that. So we\u2019re committed to that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to invest in.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim.Marty Mosby \u2013 GuggenheimI wanted to ask you a couple specific questions and then ask Mike a very broad, strategic question. If you look at the $1.3 billion of expenses related to the litigation and foreclosure settlement, can you break that out between Citi Holdings and what was in Citicorp?John GerspachI think that\u2019s already broken out for you on one of the first slides that we got in the presentation package. I think if you look at Slide 4 \u2026Marty Mosby - GuggenheimI\u2019m sorry. I got that. If you look at the loss improvement that you saw in Citi Holdings, we talked a lot about release of allowance but when you\u2019re starting to look at the actual charges and the losses coming down, can you give us a little bit more color about what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable this new low level of losses would be?John GerspachWhen you\u2019re talking about the low level of losses, Marty, I assume you\u2019re referring to the net credit losses that we \u2026Marty Mosby - GuggenheimThat\u2019s correct, yes, and about a 46% drop that we saw there this quarter.John GerspachYes, and as we said, we try to give you a little bit more color on that on the following slide, Slide 20, where we break out the net credit losses on mortgages which constitute the \u2013 certainly the vast majority of the NCLs in that business.Mortgages basically constitute three-quarters of the NCLs that we have in Holdings and I think you see a fairly clear trend on that page.Now, we certainly \u2013 again, given the current environment and where we see things today, we would anticipate some continued improvement in those trends.Marty Mosby - GuggenheimAnd then lastly, the strategic question is as we\u2019ve structured the management team, it\u2019s kind of a traditional consumer versus business type of structure. How do you foresee driving the businesses such that you can make sure the focus in those two units and the cost sale and the relationship building continues to move forward and maybe evolve as a culture that is a little bit more traditional banking in nature as you continue to build out the new direction?Mike CorbatSo if you look, Marty, what we announced is we announced co-presidents of the company, Jamie and Manuel each running in essence global products and coverage organizations, Manuel on the consumer side, Jamie on the institutional side.And in those roles, they\u2019ve got all of the products reporting into them. So you can then go to the next level and, look, we did what we did as part of the reconstructive operations in technology. Obviously operations in technology are critical parts of the operating businesses that we\u2019re in.So in 2008 and 2009, we actually pulled operations back from being embedded in the businesses, I think to reset the functions around the controls we saw necessary going into the more challenged environment, as well as to be mindful around costs and bloat that we thought had existed. ","I think we\u2019re at a point today, after making what I would characterize as good progress against those, whereas we look at business decisions that need to be made and where we want to make investment, and how we\u2019re going to spend those dollars, I think those become not just operations technology, safety, and soundness decisions, but they become more broadly business decisions, and I want Jamie and Manuel thinking about that. ","So in my earlier comment that Manuel has got to take our consumer business to scale around a drive toward common in our consumer franchise, and that Jamie\u2019s got to continue to wring the synergies of what I call adjacencies amongst our businesses, our client sets, out, and to make sure that we can provide the things we need, we can develop the things we need, but we can do them in an efficient way. And so I think the part of the organization attempts to dictate and drive that.","From a geographical perspective, I had the four large region heads reporting to me as well, and when you think about the balance in an organization, you want the balance between your products and your geographies, and obviously the third piece around your clients. And you\u2019re just going to make better decisions. ","When I can look at what\u2019s going on in the products, and I can measure what\u2019s going on in the geographies, and I can see what our clients, and in particular our global clients, are doing around the world, we can just make better decisions about where we want to be, how we want to be there, and where we want to use our resources. ","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","And would you say profitability, as we manage or monitor that, being focused on those two big pieces primarily, meaning consumer and commercial? Or still kind of a matrix approach across all of the different geographies, products, and all that? Or are those two business units really, with what you\u2019re breaking out, going to drive the profitability overall? ","Mike Corbat","No, I think as a company that comes to work in a hundred companies around the world every day, we\u2019ve got to have a balance between geography and product. Our products are global, many of them are world-class. We\u2019ve got to make sure that that gets celebrated and used in the right way. ","And I\u2019ll go back to the example I\u2019ve used before, that when we think of EMEA, where I came from, we operate in 55 countries, and we come to work very differently in most of those countries. And so if you\u2019re going to make sure you get the most out of your franchise, you\u2019ve got to be mindful of that, and make sure that you\u2019re driving the metrics and holding people accountable for the things that you need to do. ","If not, what you tend to see is you tend to see style drift, or you tend to see the business start to veer into activities that really aren\u2019t core to its overall mission and principles. And having spent three or four years trying to clean that up, I\u2019m not anxious or willing to go back there. ","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","And then lastly, and thanks for your time here, when you look at just the business lines and segments that are reported, do you see any changes related to that in relation to the changes that you made here in management? ","Mike Corbat","I think right now we\u2019re focused on the metrics that really drive these businesses. I think over time, as always, we need to make sure that our reporting structure matches our management structure, and I think today it does. So I\u2019m comfortable with it, but over time we\u2019ll continue to reassess that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. ","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Just on the lines of some of those questions that you\u2019ve been getting, are there significant businesses that you think you would consider exiting? And as you think about savings, do you see them more U.S. or non-U.S. following this down payment that you talk about? ","Mike Corbat","You characterize it as a down payment. I didn\u2019t. I think that we went through an extensive, exhaustive amount of work around the work for the 2013 budget. And again, I think we made a number of decisions in terms of what it was we felt we needed to do, and what were the right choices around those things. ","Again, I think as we go forward, I don\u2019t want to be in a position, or the company to be in a position, where we do these in one-offs. It\u2019s got to be BAU, we\u2019ve got to continually be assessing how, and where, and with whom, and in what ways we\u2019re using our resources. And that\u2019s got to be driven and compared at the business level, and I think that\u2019s got to be something that\u2019s ongoing rather than either being done on an occasional basis or in a step function basis. ","Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganWhen you talk about individual country \u2013 when you talk about having all these metrics that you\u2019re going to put out, are you going to vary them by country because obviously individual country dynamics vary a lot, your market position varies a lot.So some countries, even on that \u2013 based on that, you\u2019re not going to be able to have the same efficiency ratio as the most efficient bank. So are you going to be customizing it that way or are you going to drive more top of the house and, if so, what level do you intend to share with us when you do?Mike CorbatWell, I think that we need to \u2013 and we\u2019ve already started the work around the country strategies and, again, we come to work as you described, in many places in very different ways and, therefore, the things that we want to hold people accountable for and the things we want to measure need to vary and that\u2019s the direction that we\u2019re taking the firm.I think in terms of sharing those metrics at a granular basis I don\u2019t \u2013 being in a 100 countries, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that we would care to do or probably in some ways you would find worthwhile.But certainly at the top of the house, which will be a roll up rather than drive down. We\u2019ll be choosing those metrics that we want to share with you.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganMaybe at a continent level like you do right now, like Asia, Latin America, that kind of?Mike CorbatAgain, we\u2019re working on metrics and over the next couple of months we\u2019ll be out with some things.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganJohn, a couple of questions for you. When you look at your Basel III capital ratio, your assets seem to have come down more than RWA. Did something change to cause the fact that the RWA didn\u2019t come down as much, especially given that you reduced assets in Citi Holdings which should actually have a higher risk rate associated with them?John GerspachExcept, Vivek, it\u2019s not every asset in Citi Holdings is weighted the exact same. So I would say that for this quarter, when you take a look at the total amount, the $15 billion that came down, some of it was in lower risk weighted assets or more favorably risk weighted assets than at the higher end. And it\u2019s just simply that. It\u2019s just a matter of mix.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganBut on top of that, you came down 50 plus (inaudible) in Citicorp, so I would have thought that at the very least you would have come down by \u2013 I guess what you\u2019re saying is what you\u2019re coming down is much lower risk weighted even in Citicorp, that\u2019s why your RWA is not coming down that much.John GerspachThink about the reductions that we made in cash. It took $60 billion, so.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganDTA, the disallowed amount, John, went up by $2 billion. What did the total amount of DTA do?John GerspachTotal amount of DTA in the quarter increased by about $2 billion.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganAnd now what? \u00a0$56 million?John GerspachI\u2019m sorry, sir.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganIs that about $56 million?John GerspachAbout $55.3 million I think will be the number that will be in the K.Vivek Juneja \u2013 JPMorganAnd lastly, just a clarification on a comment you made earlier, so you expect legal related charges to continue at a $600 million to $700 million rate going forward? \u00a0Did I hear that correctly?John GerspachNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you heard at all, Vivek. What I said was that the legal and related expenses are going to stay elevated and somewhat volatile but that we certainly didn\u2019t expect the $1.3 billion of expense that we had in the fourth quarter to represent a new norm.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust.Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrustJohn, just \u2013 this is just more of a structural question but if I did my numbers correctly in each of the major business lines within Citicorp, generated between let\u2019s call it 1% and 9% in positive operating leverage year-over-year. Do those figures sound about correct to you?John GerspachYes, yes, roughly. I don\u2019t have it in my head, so each one was positive.Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrustSo I guess my real question is this. And those numbers, the only adjustment I made was to exclude CVA and DBA but nothing else about what you might consider non-recurring or otherwise diminishing environmental expenses.John GerspachSo the only difference between the way that I would have explained it and probably the way I would think of it is I would also adjust for the fourth quarter repositioning which ran $1 billion or so in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $400 million. But if that the only adjustment that we\u2019re differing on? We\u2019re not going to get that wide of a gap.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrustSo the heart of my question is this, since we generally agree on that point: It would seem, then, that given what you\u2019ve articulated with respect to additional expense initiatives and some of the benefits of the repositioning action and some of the things that are being undertaken in Asia, etc., even in the context of a difficult rate environment, doesn\u2019t it then suggest that we\u2019re going to see continued operating leverage across these business lines over \u201913 in let\u2019s call it a static environment?","John Gerspach","The answer to that is, I\u2019m not going to say in business by business, because spread compression is going to hit you differently in different businesses, and I think we\u2019ve seen that. Certainly in Transaction Services, if you\u2019re not able to offset spread compression, but the volume, you can have the impact of spread compression, you know, it will take away revenues without impacting your level of volume. ","And so therefore, you\u2019re really running the same stuff through your shop. So your ability to take expense out is then just limited to your ability to generate reengineering savings, which may or may not be enough to offset the impact of the spread compression.","So in general, you know, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way, but it is somewhat dependent business by business, and it\u2019s also dependent upon the magnitude of the spread compression that is impacting each business. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrustAnd then just to follow up on that, outside of spread compression, which is obviously something that you [unintelligible], what then would be, in your mind, the other big risk factors that would disrupt the realization of positive operating leverage across the various businesses? ","John Gerspach","Well, general economics. If our customers aren\u2019t growing their businesses, if our customers have a change in sentiment as far as how they view the general economy and cut back on either savings or borrowing or any of that, that certainly is a risk factor. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrustSo it sounds like outside of deterioration in the broader macro-environment, what you\u2019re suggesting is the spread issue remains a serious one to look at, but other than that, we should probably be thinking about continued low single digit operating leverage expansion. ","John Gerspach","Although I probably will be directing you to make sure that you do a thorough reading of every risk factor that we publish in the 400-page 10-K that we\u2019ll be delivering to you at some point in time in the next 45 days or so. ","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrustWell, I look forward to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners. ","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Just following on that line of questioning, on expenses, can you talk about the areas that you\u2019re most focused on investing? You talked about, obviously, cost saves and there\u2019s more to come, it sounds like, after this first cut, but the investment spend that you need to focus on to drive the volume and the revenue, can you talk a little bit about where you\u2019re most focused? ","Mike Corbat","Sure, so we\u2019re focused in a few areas. One is in the operations and technology area in terms of continuing to combine, streamline, develop, and roll out common systems around our global network. I think that would be one significant area where we\u2019ve made investment. We\u2019re going to need the continue to make investment. We\u2019re always investing in our people, in terms of wanting to continue to retain and attract talent, and in particular in our institutional parts of our business, we\u2019ll be continuing to invest in the build-out of our commodities businesses around the world. We\u2019ll continue to be investing in digital and digitization around our consumer banking. I\u2019d say those are probably a few of the more significant investments. ","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","And then regionally, if we were just to focus on the global consumer bank, it sounds like you\u2019re turning the corner in terms of revenue in Asia and Lat-Am remains very strong. How should we think about revenue in North America? ","Mike Corbat","I think from a North American \u2013 in particular, I would say US consumer perspective, I think the environment, while John spoke to some of the positive attributes, I think that needs to be balanced with some of the realities of the low interest rate environment.I think that as others have forecasted and I think that we see is a slowing in terms of the mortgage refinance boom and the economics that have been associated with that. I think those are two reasonable headwinds that we\u2019re going to have to overcome in 2013 in North America consumer.Andrew Marquardt - Evercore PartnersOutside of mortgage, can the cards business \u2013 should we think about that actually growing this year or still needed?Mike CorbatI think we\u2019ve done a lot of work. We\u2019ve made fresh and we\u2019ve stabilized the portfolio. We\u2019ve got to get growth back into it and that\u2019s going to be a focus.Andrew Marquardt - Evercore PartnersAnd then just lastly, as you\u2019re going through your ongoing business reviews and work on operational efficiencies, have you had a chance to get a sense of longer term, the all-in earnings power of the franchise? Will you also be updating us on your views on that longer term?I guess historically you guys have talked about it an ROA 125, 150. Is that still applicable or should we wait for an update?Mike CorbatI think \u2013 addressing those questions in reverse order \u2013 I think that the ROA 125 to 150 in this environment is not a practical goal to set out there in the short term. So we\u2019ll be resetting that.I think we\u2019ll be coming out over the next coming months, as I said, with some things that we\u2019re going to be measured against and we\u2019ll try and lay that out and show you best we can the path for the company going forward.OperatorAnd you have no further questions.

Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.","John Andrews","Rachel, thank you. Good morning, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. On our call today, Vikram Pandit, our CFO -- CEO, I'm sorry, will speak first; and John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions. ","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2010 Form 10-K. ","With that out of the way, let me turn it over to Vikram.","Vikram S. Pandit","John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. As you know, earlier today, we reported earnings of $1.2 billion in net income for the fourth quarter of 2011. This increased our net income for the year to $11.3 billion, up 6% from 2010. ","The fourth quarter was dominated by the macro environment, and our earnings clearly suffered as a result. Market activity was down significantly and our clients reduced their risk. Any of our businesses geared to the capital markets, such as sales and trading, Securities and Fund Services and GTS and even investment sales and consumer banking were impacted. ","Investor activity was particularly weak in December as reflected in the volumes we experienced. In light of the macro environment, we have been quite cautious. The situation in Europe is being driven by politics as much as anything else. And given its inherent unpredictability, we have prudently derisked and hedged our exposures, actions which have further impacted our revenues. ","However, our consumer and nonmarkets-related businesses continue to perform well as we executed our strategy. Throughout Citicorp, we grew our loans by 14% from 2010, including a 24% increase in corporate loans. And GTS continued to show positive momentum with the full year revenue of 5% from 2010. Revenue from International Consumer Banking grew by 6%, x FX for the year as we opened 3 million new accounts while increasing average loans and deposits on a constant dollar basis by $15 billion and $9 billion, respectively. ","During the quarter, we achieved positive operating leverage in Latin America and again in Asia during the quarter. In the U.S., customer accounts, deposits, loans and revenue each grew from the previous quarter. We continue to make progress in winding down Citi Holdings. We reduced Holdings' assets by $90 billion during the year. And after considering the impact of the transfer of Retail Partner Cards into Citicorp, Holdings comprised only 12% of Citigroup's balance sheet. ","And as I indicated in December, we took a $400 million severance charge in the fourth quarter due to the reduction of approximately 5,000 positions. There were also other macro and episodic charges that John will go over in his presentation, including FX, a Japan DTA write-down and increased legal and related expenses. We also didn't have the CVA\/DVA benefit, which had substantially increased our revenue in the third quarter. ","As we know, the situation in Europe is having a global impact. We believe it will impact U.S. GDB -- GDP by somewhere within 0.5% to 1.5%, and the emerging markets are being affected as well. The European banks have $40 trillion in total assets and they are deleveraging as a result. And from what we understand, these banks hold 65% of an emerging market debt and finance 80% of global trade finance. So the global banking system will need to step up and fill the void that comes from the deleveraging. ","As usual, the future isn't easy to predict, but we believe we are prepared. Despite the improved tone of the market so far this month and the positive signs coming from Europe, we will continue to maintain a cautious posture until the political aspects of the current situation are clear. ","In 2011, our expenses were impacted by several factors. Most significantly, a weakened dollar added $800 million in FX, while legal and related expenses were $1.3 billion higher than in 2010. These drove an increase in total expenses of just under 7%. But as you will see, our core operating expenses rose by 2.1%. This includes $3.9 billion in investments, $1.9 billion of which were funded through our ongoing expense reduction initiatives. ","The $3.9 billion in investments included approximately $1 billion to meet regulatory requirements. We also upgraded talent in both our institutional and consumer businesses. Other investments from modernizing our branches to increased marketing are necessary to attract and serve our clients better. ","A few years ago, the company had substantially reduced its spending on consumer marketing. And in 2011, we increased that spending to competitive levels. These are longer-cycle investments, but they are starting to pay off through increases in our new account acquisitions in the U.S. and the attaining of positive operating leverage in key EM consumer markets. ","That being said, I believe these increases in expense levels are behind us. We have a robust reengineering program and our goal is to self-fund new investments going forward. As a result of this and other actions, we currently expect to reduce our expenses by $2.5 billion to $3 billion in 2012 compared to the reported full year 2011 level, of course, excluding changes in FX or unanticipated legal costs or significant one-timers. We also continue to right-size our business for the opportunities we see, particularly in Securities and Banking. So we're prepared whether the current environment proves to be a result of cyclical or secular trends. ","John will now go over the slides, and I'll come back later with him and would be happy to take your questions.","John C. Gerspach","Thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 2, on a full year basis, Citigroup reported revenues of $78.4 billion in 2011. Operating expenses were $50.7 billion and credit costs were $12.8 billion, down over 50% from the prior year. Pretax income for 2011 was nearly $15 billion and net income was $11.3 billion or $3.69 per share. We earned $14.4 billion of net income in Citicorp, with earnings in Asia and Latin America contributing roughly half of the total. And we significantly narrowed the net loss in Citi Holdings to $2.4 billion from $4.3 billion in the prior year. ","Before I go into more detail, I'd like to spend a minute on significant items affecting the fourth quarter and comparable periods as shown on Slide 3. In addition to the difficult macro environment and our corresponding actions which Vikram described earlier, Citigroup's results reflect a number of firm-specific items, several of which we previewed for you in early December. First, revenue comparisons are significantly skewed by credit spread-related items. Citigroup's CVA and DVA were a negative $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a positive $1.9 billion last quarter and a negative $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in our lending business in Securities and Banking, we recorded hedge losses of nearly $300 million this quarter, driven by spread tightening in our lending portfolio compared to hedge gains of nearly $650 million last quarter. ","Second, we recorded significantly higher legal and related expenses, as well as repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2011. Legal and related expenses were over $550 million in the fourth quarter, including an increase in reserves related to interchange litigation. Severance charges were over $400 million in the fourth quarter, more than double the amount of repositioning expenses in prior periods. Finally, this quarter, we recorded a $300 million charge to write-down the value of deferred tax assets in Japan as the result of a tax rate change. In addition to these items, our reported results were affected by foreign exchange translation. As the U.S. dollar generally strengthened in the fourth quarter against local currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses and credit costs. While FX translation had no material impact on our overall earnings for the quarter, it did affect individual line items and reported business drivers, which I will discuss more as we go through the presentation. ","On Slide 4, we show fourth quarter results. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $1.2 billion or $0.38 per diluted share. Revenues of $17.2 billion were down 7% versus the prior year on a reported basis as growth in International Consumer Banking and Transaction Services was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, Securities and Banking and North America Consumer Banking. Expenses of $12.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year. Nearly 2\/3 of the increase was attributable to the combination of higher legal and related costs, as well as severance, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, expenses were up 1.5% over last year, principally due to higher investment spending, partially offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. Cost of credit continued to improve year-over-year, down 41% to $2.9 billion. Year-over-year, Citigroup end of period loans were flat on a reported basis and up 1%, excluding the impact of FX, as continued loan growth in Citicorp outpaced the wind-down of Citi Holdings. ","Turning now to Citicorp and Citi Holdings on Slide 5. Citicorp reported revenues of $14 billion and net income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Versus last year, Citicorp loans grew 14% on a reported basis, including 7% growth in consumer and 24% growth in corporate loans. We grew loans in every business in Citicorp in the fourth quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. Citi Holdings reported revenues of $2.8 billion and a net loss of $806 million. Citi Holdings ended the year with $269 billion of assets, down $20 billion during the quarter and $90 billion year-over-year. Adjusting for the first quarter transfer of Retail Partner Cards into Citicorp, Citi Holdings would have ended the year with $225 billion of assets or 12% of total Citigroup assets. ","On Slide 6, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA\/DVA, Citicorp's revenues of $14.1 billion in the fourth quarter were down 8% from the prior year and down 11% from the prior quarter, driven by lower revenues in Securities and Banking. As I discussed earlier, Securities and Banking results reflect nearly $300 million of hedge losses in our lending business in the fourth quarter compared to hedge gains of nearly $650 million last quarter. Excluding these hedge gains and losses, Citicorp revenues x CVA\/DVA were down 5% sequentially. Operating expenses of $10.2 billion were up 8% versus the prior year. Nearly half of the increase was attributable to the combination of higher legal and related costs, as well as severance, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, expenses were up 4% over last year, primarily driven by higher investment spending, mostly in consumer banking and operations and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and other expense reductions. Citicorp's net credit losses were $1.9 billion, down 29% from the prior year, driven by Citi-branded cards in North America. We released $699 million in net loan loss reserves, down from $741 million last year as higher net releases in Citi-branded cards were more than offset by lower releases in the corporate portfolio and a small net build in International Consumer Banking. Excluding CVA\/DVA, earnings before taxes of $2.7 billion were down 31% versus last year, driven by lower revenues as higher operating costs were largely offset by the lower cost of credit. ","Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Revenues of $3.5 billion were down 2% versus last year, driven by card revenues, reflecting the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and a decline in average card loans, partially offset by an increase in mortgage revenues. Expenses of $2.1 billion were up 31% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, driven in part by an increase in legal reserves related to interchange litigation. Excluding this reserve increase, expenses were up modestly versus last quarter as we continue to make investments in our North America consumer franchise. Credit costs declined 74% from last year to $372 million. Net credit losses were down 41% to $1 billion, driven by Citi-branded cards, and the net reserve release was $681 million this quarter compared to $348 million in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew by 82% year-over-year to $386 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to see signs of progress in our North America consumer business. Sequentially, for the third consecutive quarter, we grew our total revenues, card accounts and end of period card loans. Purchase sales grew 2% year-over-year and card accounts were up 4%. Average deposits were up 2% year-over-year and retail loans were up over 25%. ","Turning to our International Consumer Banking businesses on Slide 8. First, as Vikram mentioned, both Asia and Latin America achieved positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In total, International Consumer Banking revenues grew 2% versus last year, while expenses remained flat. The dollar generally appreciated in the fourth quarter, resulting in a negative impact on reported revenues. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 6% year-over-year and 2% from the third quarter, with sequential growth in both Asia and Latin America. Overall, revenue growth continued to reflect improvement in most underlying drivers, offset by spread compression. Accounts grew 4% year-over-year. And on a constant dollar basis, we grew average deposits, average loans and purchase sales in every region in the fourth quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. ","Investment sales were lower, however, reflecting weaker investor sentiment in the face of a continued challenging macroeconomic environment in the fourth quarter. Expenses of $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter were roughly flat versus last year, including a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher severance charges. Excluding these items, expenses were up roughly 3% over last year as we are now beginning to lap our higher levels of investment spending in Asia and Latin America in the second half of 2010. Credit costs were $787 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $593 million last year. While net credit losses declined 10% to $683 million, we recorded a small net reserve build of $72 million in the fourth quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. We continued to grow our international consumer loans in a disciplined manner, as we discussed in more detail on last quarter's call. We believe the underlying credit quality of the portfolio has remained stable to improving. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew 19% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. ","And on Slide 9, we show growth trends for International Consumer Banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 13% over the prior year. Average deposits were up 6% and purchase sales grew 11% in the fourth quarter. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown both net credit margin and pretax earnings, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, each quarter for over 2 years. ","Slide 10 shows our Securities and Banking business. As I mentioned earlier, revenue comparisons for Securities and Banking in the fourth quarter are difficult, given the swings in CVA and DVA and the $939 million sequential change in hedge results in our lending business. Excluding only CVA\/DVA, revenues of $3.3 billion were down by nearly 1\/3 on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. If we also exclude the sequential impact of lending hedges, revenues were down by 15% from the third quarter, with particular weakness in the last 3 weeks of December. In Investment Banking, revenues of $638 million were down 13% sequentially, driven by lower activity levels across all products. x CVA\/DVA, Equity Market revenues of $32 million were down 20% sequentially, driven by a decline in market volumes globally, which resulted in lower cash equity revenues. This was partially offset by narrowing losses in proprietary trading where the wind-down is now complete. We also continue to experience weak trading results in our equity derivatives business. Fixed Income Market revenues, x CVA\/DVA were down 24% sequentially to $1.7 billion. We continue to experience pressure in credit and securitized products in the fourth quarter. ","In rates and currencies, G10 products also declined from a strong third quarter, although this was partially offset by growth in emerging markets products. Lending revenues was $164 million, down from $1 billion last quarter, driven by the sequential change in hedge results I discussed earlier. Private Bank revenues, excluding CVA\/DVA, were down 5% sequentially to $517 million, mainly driven by lower capital markets activity. Total operating expenses of $3.7 billion were up 2% from last year and 4% sequentially, driven mainly by severance charges. Absent severance, expenses would have been down 4% versus last year, driven by lower incentive compensation and a positive impact from FX. And sequentially, expenses would have been roughly flat. Credit costs were $69 million in the fourth quarter versus a benefit of $60 million last year. ","Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 11. Revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% from the fourth quarter of last year as strong growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset a decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 7%, primarily due to higher trade revenues and increased deposits, partially offset by the continued -- by the impact of the continued low rate environment and FX. Securities and Fund Services was down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower settlement volumes, spread compression and the impact of FX. ","While lower Securities and Fund Services revenues reflected the overall capital markets environment, most underlying drivers for Transaction Services continued to show momentum. Average trade loans were up over 50% from last year. Average deposits were up 4%. And on a constant dollar basis, assets under custody were also up year-over-year, with good inflows in our custody assets. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 14% versus last year, mainly due to investment spending, as well as severance and higher legal and related costs. Sequentially, the 4% expense increase was primarily due to severance and higher legal and related costs as our level of investment spending is beginning to flatten quarter-over-quarter. ","On Slide 12, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The loss in Citi Holdings was $806 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior quarter and down from a loss of over $1 billion last year. Revenues were down 30% year-over-year to $2.8 billion due primarily to lower assets. Operating expenses of $2.2 billion were down 8% versus last year. Total credit costs were down 43% to $1.6 billion. ","Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 13. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were $43 million this quarter, down from last year due to a lower contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 13% versus last year to $3 billion, driven by declining loan balances. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues were negative $234 million in the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue was negative $94 million as interest-earning assets continue to represent a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool, while we continue to incur funding costs on the total portfolio. Noninterest revenue was negative $140 million, driven by realized net losses and other marks during the quarter as compared to net gains in the prior year. ","Operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Sequentially, expenses were up 4% due to higher legal and related costs, driven by the mortgage business, as well as an increase in interchange litigation reserves. Credit costs were down 43% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, as credit trends continued to improve in both the consumer and corporate portfolios. Total net credit losses were down 47% to $2.2 billion, and we released $767 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings. ","Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings' assets. We ended the quarter with $269 billion in Citi Holdings or 14% of total Citigroup assets. The $20 billion reduction in the fourth quarter was comprised of nearly $12 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $7 billion of net runoff and pay downs and nearly $2 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. ","Slide 15 shows the results for the Corporate\/Other segment. Revenues of $384 million were up significantly from last year, mainly driven by hedging activities partially offset by lower investment yields and lower gains on sales of AFS securities. Expenses were down by $82 million versus last year, mainly due to lower legal and related expenses. Assets of $286 billion included approximately $95 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $130 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities. ","Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 16. For full year 2011, expenses totaled $50.7 billion, up nearly 7% from $47.4 billion in 2010. In both 2010 and 2011, expenses included episodic legal and related costs, as well as repositioning charges. In order to better compare the core operating expense growth year-over-year, we have isolated these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange. In 2010, expenses of $47.4 billion included approximately $700 million of episodic legal and related costs and roughly $500 million of repositioning charges, and the year-over-year impact of foreign exchange was roughly $800 million. ","Adjusting for these items, core operating costs on a constant dollar basis were roughly $47 billion in 2010. In 2011, investment spending was roughly $3.9 billion higher for the full year, and we funded nearly half of these investments with efficiency savings of $1.9 billion. All other variances in core operating costs, including higher volume-related expenses in Citicorp, were more than offset by lower costs in Citi Holdings. Therefore, on a constant dollar basis, core operating expenses of $48 billion in 2011 were approximately $1 billion or just over 2% higher versus the prior year. ","In 2011, episodic legal and related costs were roughly $2 billion and repositioning charges were around $700 million, bringing total expenses up to $50.7 billion. While some level of episodic expenses will likely continue in 2012, we remain highly focused on managing our core operating expense trends. ","Slide 17 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the fourth quarter, down 9% sequentially to $4.1 billion, and the net LLR release was $1.5 billion, up slightly from the third quarter. We ended the quarter with $30.1 billion of total loan loss reserves and our LLR ratio was 4.7%. Consumer NCLs declined 7% sequentially to $4 billion, and we released $1.2 billion in net loan loss reserves. Corporate credit was a benefit of $158 million in the fourth quarter compared to a cost of $86 million last quarter on lower net credit losses and a higher reserve release. Total nonaccrual loans represented 1.7% of total loans at year end, down from nearly 3% at the end of 2010. ","Slide 18 shows our international consumer credit trends, which generally remained stable to improving in Citicorp in the fourth quarter as loans continued to grow. In Asia, the NCL rate remained stable in the 1% range in the fourth quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies were lower than last quarter. In Latin America, the sequential NCL rate increase reflects the impact of adjustments, primarily in cards to conform loss recognition procedures in Central America. Excluding these adjustments, the NCL rate would have been stable in the fourth quarter and delinquency rates continued to improve. In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, the sequential decline in loans and the uptick in delinquencies in the fourth quarter mainly reflect the announced sale of our retail banking business in Belgium as these loans were moved into other assets held for sale. ","On Slide 19, we show our North America card portfolios. In Citi-branded cards, the NCL rate continued to improve in the fourth quarter, down 63 basis points sequentially to 5.3%, and 90-plus day delinquencies were down to 1.3%. In Retail Partner Cards, the NCL rate improved to 7.3% this quarter, and 90-plus day delinquencies remained stable. ","On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. NCLs improved in both portfolios in the fourth quarter, although as we have previously discussed, the pace continued to moderate. In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with nearly $68 billion of loans, down 16% from 1 year ago. Net credit losses were down 6% sequentially to $412 million. As we discussed last quarter, overall delinquency trends are beginning to show the impact of re-defaults of previously modified mortgages. While, at the same time, the pace of asset sales and modifications has slowed. ","Sales of delinquent mortgages, for example, declined to nearly $300 million in the fourth quarter from roughly $500 million in the prior quarter. These converging trends drove an increase in 90-plus day delinquencies in the fourth quarter, up $260 million to $4.1 billion. Early-stage delinquencies in this portfolio, however, actually improved quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, re-default rates for HAMP and other modifications continued to track favorably versus expectations through the fourth quarter, with expectations for re-defaults and a resulting increase in net credit losses already factored into our net loan loss reserve balance. ","In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with $40 billion of loans, down 12% from a year ago. Net credit losses were down 2% sequentially to $533 million in the fourth quarter. 90-plus day delinquencies were flat versus the prior quarter at $1 billion, while early-stage delinquencies improved. Overall, the pace of improvement in our home equity NCLs and delinquencies has slowed, and we are watching these trends closely. We continue to allocate roughly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings or 31 months of coincident NCL coverage. ","Now let me close with some comments about 2012. Clearly, the operating environment continues to be extraordinarily challenging in a number of businesses, none more so than Securities and Banking. While we have seen some pickup in activity in the first weeks of January, the macro uncertainty that has dominated the securities market still remains unresolved. And that largely reflects the ongoing overhang of the Eurozone crisis. ","As Vikram noted, we reduced our risk in the fourth quarter and we saw both institutional and retail clients do likewise, which contributed to meaningfully lower levels of activity across markets and regions. While we firmly believe that Europe has the financial wherewithal to solve the sovereign crisis, any resolution will be a political process, which continues to be uncertain and unpredictable. So until the markets believe that an achievable, comprehensive resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis has been structured, the macro uncertainty that has dominated investor activity will likely remain an issue. ","Now the challenges in Europe are not all bad news for us. The significant deleveraging of the European banks is creating meaningful competitive opportunities in a number of businesses, particularly in Transaction Services, as European banks are pulling back from serving many clients in key businesses they historically dominate, like trade finance. And we are pursuing those opportunities, but doing so in a cautious manner as we continue to support our clients while maintaining a tight risk profile. ","Given the ongoing headwinds in Securities and Banking, we remain very focused on expenses and, as Vikram mentioned, also on ensuring our capacity is aligned with the opportunities that we see. For 2012, we currently expect Citigroup's full year operating expenses, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and any significant episodic items, will be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion lower than the reported 2011 expenses of $50.7 billion. ","Turning to our other businesses. In Transaction Services, we expect revenues to continue to grow at a moderate pace despite the low interest rate environment, and we are reaffirming our expectation that Transaction Services will achieve positive operating leverage by the second or third quarter of this year. ","In North America Consumer Banking, we expect consumer credit to continue improving but at a slowing pace in 2012. We are seeing positive trends in this business as we have completed much of the portfolio derisking undertaken following the crisis. We are beginning to see the benefit of our investment spending as card accounts, purchase sales and loans have all stabilized and are now beginning to grow. We believe this will drive positive operating leverage by the end of 2012. ","In International Consumer Banking, we had positive operating leverage overall this quarter as both Latin America and Asia generated positive operating leverage, building on the momentum started by Asia in the third quarter. While we are seeing some slowing in certain drivers, like investment sales in Asia, reflecting again the cautious sentiment of even retail investors, broadly speaking, we continue to see growth in loans, deposits, purchase sales and accounts in virtually every region. ","In Citi Holdings, the transfer of Retail Partner Cards business will result in approximately $45 billion of assets, including $41 billion of loans moving to Citicorp. As a result of this transfer, earnings in Citi Holdings will be lower going forward as the cards business was the single source of meaningful profitability in Local Consumer Lending segment in Citi Holdings. Nonetheless, we are reaffirming our prior guidance that existing reserves plus expected pre-provision net revenue in the Local Consumer Lending business remain sufficient to cover expected lifetime losses in the remaining LCL portfolio. ","We continue to believe mortgage-related issues are the single largest source of risk facing the U.S. banking industry. While we expect our overall delinquencies to rise slightly in coming quarters as some previously modified mortgages start re-defaulting, to date, those re-default rates remain below our expectations. Despite the expected delinquency increase, we saw some positive signs in early bucket mortgage delinquencies this quarter that we will continue to watch carefully. In the meantime, litigation and regulatory risk in the mortgage business will remain high and we continue to focus on further reducing our portfolio. ","So, in summary, the uncertain macro environment will continue to be a meaningful headwind for our Securities and Banking business, but our consumer businesses and Transaction Services should continue to exhibit growth, and we will continue to wind-down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner. ","With that, Vikram and I would be more than happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","You gave a lot of comments around expenses, so I appreciate that. When you were talking about the year-on-year potential pullback of $2.5 billion to $3 billion, can you give a thought on just, a, geography -- and I don't mean that international, I mean more by business. Meaning, it looks like you're still growing all the consumer businesses and what you want to come out in international franchise. Is there -- it leaves me thinking the IB might be one of the source of funds, so just curious there.","John C. Gerspach","Yes, I'm not going to go into individual business guidance at this point in time, Glenn, all right?","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Let's attack it maybe a little differently. In the S&B, you talked about focus on aligning capacity with the -- and the size of the opportunities. This has been obviously a tough market and there are cyclical pressures as you mentioned. But how do you get your arms around the rule changes happening and then the revenue environment falling? How do you weigh that cyclical versus secular? And what's the timing on making those decisions because it has a big impact on how you size the infrastructure?","Vikram S. Pandit","I think that's right, Glenn. And certainly, by all means try to parse out secular versus cyclical is not easy. And I think we've tried to do that this quarter, 2 different sets of actions. The cyclical aspect, obviously, we've addressed for compensation. And on the secular side, some of the restructuring reserves that we've taken and the positions we eliminated try to get at that secular aspect of the markets. Now if you kind of think about the environment, there are still some significant overhangs and that's notwithstanding the fact that the market activities this year so far have been significantly better than fourth quarter. They're still running below the first quarter of last year, but there are questions out there. Questions such as, how is the Greek situation going to be resolved and it's March 20 and that's before the fiscal compact gets signed. These are all the kind of situations that are still out there, which suggests that it's very hard to parse out exactly what part of the activity we're seeing is because of the cyclical situation versus how much of secular. Now there's no magic answer to that except, I can tell you, we are keenly watching that and we'll make whatever changes we need to make.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I guess, I'm sure you all get the same thing I get from investors and probably your board, too, of trying to understand what you have at your fingertips in the capital markets business that's fixed versus incentive comp, and I don't know if you can talk towards that. But I still want to get towards the timing because I don't have the crystal ball either, but the investor base wants to know an action plan. Can -- in 2012, do you think we'll see either an improvement in activity or something more material on the structure of the business?","Vikram S. Pandit","I think -- I hope that 2012 is the year where we get the European overhang out of here. And that would be a significant shift that would then allow one to gauge what's happening on a much more normalized basis. And with that in mind, we're certainly thinking about 2012 as the year where you won't make a lot of those decisions. Having said that, again, I want to go back to saying that the actions we've taken so far are our best view as to what reflects the secular actions we need to take. As I said again, we'll keep monitoring it and if that changes, we'll take those decisions.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just final quickie, on international consumer, I know it gets messed up a little bit with FX and what's constant dollar, but you mentioned a little bit of slowing in Asia investment sales. Is everything else on the international consumer engine still growing and headed in the right direction in your mind? A simple answer.","John C. Gerspach","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","John, could you give us a little feel for what drove the increase in legal reserves for the interchange issue?","John C. Gerspach","Well, as we take a look at what our potential exposure is under the interchange litigation, we needed to increase the level of reserve that we had.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So you're just looking ahead to the case that will come into court, I guess, in September of this year?","John C. Gerspach","I'm not quite sure of what the date is. I know it's later this year.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on net interest income and the margin, this quarter, we saw the net interest margin percentage up, but your average earning assets down. A little bit of color on what happened this quarter, and then just some thoughts on the outlook for net interest income and margin, please?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. From a NIM point of view, as you note, our net interest margin improved by about 7 basis points this quarter. But a lot of that was driven, probably about 5 basis points of the 7 basis point increase was really driven by the fact that we took down our trading assets. And trading assets have got some component of interest-earning assets in there. We tended to take down the lower -- those trading assets with the lowest-earning rate. So I would look at that as almost being a -- almost like a one-off benefit that we got this quarter, John. I would anticipate that with some modest growth again in our trading assets, we'll probably be back to a 2.85%  NIM ratio next quarter, give or take 1 or 2 basis points.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of growing net interest income, you've had some loan growth across the franchise. What will be the key to your ability to grow net interest income this year?","John C. Gerspach","Well, don't forget, you still have -- you're still fighting a couple of trends. We're able to grow loans, but we still -- in Citicorp, we still have those Citi Holdings loans coming off the books. And the Citi Holdings loans tend to have, with the exception of, say, Student Lending, those student -- those Citi Holdings loans have got some higher spreads than the loans that we're building on Citicorp. So we're still going to be -- we were having a little bit of a fight as far as just swimming upstream a little bit, working our way through the reductions in Citi Holdings and offset by Citicorp. And then you've got -- we're still existing in a very low interest rate environment. So it's hard to point right now to solid growth trends in net interest margin. I think you can say at this point in time that we feel pretty good that absent that onetime benefit that you see this quarter, that NIM should roughly stabilize.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then also, a different question on DTA. Could you update us whether you consumed or built DTA this quarter on a net basis and what your expectations might be to recapture DTA in 2012?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, fine, John. This quarter, we would have generated additional DTA. So in your parlance, we would have built DTA. I think the important thing for DTA is to look where we are on a full year basis. We started the year at about $52 billion of DTA. We'll end the year at about $51 billion. But more importantly, as we've discussed in the past, are the real components of the DTA. And you'll recall, last year -- and when -- and you'll see this laid out in more detail when we publish our K. When you looked at that portion of the DTA, that really reflected U.S. federal DTA. It had a sizable component in it about $4 billion compromising NOL carryforwards. And what we were able to do this year is we've been able to completely utilize that NOL carryforward. So that will leave us, in 2012 now, able to address the monetization of the carryforward, deferred the foreign tax credits. As you may recall, we can't begin to utilize the foreign tax credits until we worked our way through the carryforward NOL. And it's the foreign tax credits that tend to expire more near term. We have some of those coming off, expiring in '17 and '18. So it was important from our point of view to work our way through the NOL this year. And now we'll be able to address the utilization of those carryforwards foreign tax credits beginning in 2012.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So even though the total DTA only came down by $1 billion for the year, you did get that $3.5 billion or $4 billion of NOLs that you were shooting for?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. As we said, there's 2 different things to look at with DTA. One is the overall gross amount of the DTA. But more -- almost more importantly are those component pieces. And so while the gross amount only came down by that $1 billion, I think that we significantly improved the mix of the remaining DTA by removing that NOL carryforward.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And last thing from me, I know you can't get into specifics, but if you or Vikram could just talk about what your goals and hopes are for capital return this year and what you hope to be able to do after the stress test and what your goals are in terms of what the stress test will show for Citigroup?","Vikram S. Pandit","Yes. Again, lot of that we submitted early this year to the Fed. They've got our stress test under their scenarios. They've got our capital-creation projections this year. They also have our capital return requests built in there as well. And what I would say to you is that we continue to have the same goals that I mentioned before, which is that this will be the year that we'll start returning capital. We also have the same goals in terms of getting the capital above 8% by the end of the year. None of those things have changed, except that the filing's gone into the regulators. And now all of us are just going to have to wait and see exactly when the response comes back.","Operator","Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that question. The -- you've obviously targeted 8% to 9% Basel III capital ratio by the end of this year for some time. Given the uncertainty in Europe, the challenging global growth outlook that you've kind of talked about and just picking up on what you just said about above 8%, should we be assuming that your target is sort of to the low end of that 8% to 9% range right now?","Vikram S. Pandit","I, again, it's hard to -- when we say 8% to 9%, it is 8% to 9%, and that's clearly true. Obviously, we and all of us are aware of the environment we're going through, and we are still targeting in between that 8% to 9%. So it depends upon a number of other actions that we've planned as well. So it's a little early to guide you to any one particular point.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just if I can go back to the discussion of expenses. I recognize that you don't, at this point, want to be pigeonholed into where you're going to target some of these expense reductions that you're talking about. But in Citi Holdings, in the Local Consumer Lending group in particular, is it fair to say that the reduction in expenses as the assets have come down has been slower than you might have expected? And is there anything that you can do as you continue to get a reduction in the portfolio there besides the transfer of assets that we should think might accelerate the reduction in the cost that you have against those pretty unproductive assets?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, Guy, that's a great question. There's probably -- there's several things that you need to think about when it comes to the Holdings' expense levels, because you're right. Assets came down 25% in Holdings during the course of the year. Expenses came down something on the order of 8% or so. But you need to think in terms of one, we did have some increased episodic legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings this year. That probably added $0.5 billion to the expense base. So it's hard to say that we could drive expenses down and absorb those increased episodic legal expenses. The second thing is, as we -- after we made the decision to move the Retail Partner Cards business back into Citicorp, we certainly increased the level of investment spend that we were making in that business. So you'll see some adjustment in the Holding levels -- Holdings' expense levels as we move Retail Partner Cards out as well. And we'll do that on a -- well, on a full restatement basis, so that we'll take the history out so you'll get a cleaner history of Holdings. The third aspect of that is we have had some incremental level of expenses in our residential mortgage business this year as we have put on additional headcount to meet the terms of the consent order that all the banks signed with the regulators earlier this year. So that had somewhat of a modest impact on the expenses themselves. And then the last factor -- I'm sorry to drag you through every little factor, is as we sell businesses in Holdings, and that's everything from the Student Loan business and other things that we've conducted, normally there's a transition period. We did this with auto loans. We do it with student loans. There's a transition period where we continued to support the transferred business. Now we get paid for that support, but what we get paid comes in through the revenue line while the expenses remained in our expense line. So all of that tends to mask what you should really begin to see as the reduction in those Holdings expenses. I still feel very confident that after we moved out partner cards and if you can adjust for some of these things like these ongoing service levels activity, you'll see that expenses are coming down closely aligned with the reduction in assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just a quick question on the expense reductions again. Can you at least give us a sense of -- is that mostly coming from headcount reductions and other efficiency gains? Or is there some pullback on the investment spend?","John C. Gerspach","Well, I think as we've said, we're not going to be increasing investment spend at the same level that we increased it in 2011. 2011, we increased investment spend year-over-year by about $3.9 billion as we've talked about. We're not targeting a $3.9 billion increase in investment spend again next year.","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","No, but is it going up or down, I guess is the question?","John C. Gerspach","Well, the investment spend will go up slightly next year. All right? We're not going to pull back from investing in the businesses. But as we've discussed in the past, we do have an ongoing reengineering program. We, again, fully expect each one of our businesses to reduce expenses on an ongoing basis by 3% to 5% annually. This year, we took $1.9 billion out of our expense base. That's roughly 4% of last year's reported expenses. And without going into -- you're trying to forecast details, you should expect that we would be able to do roughly another 4% next year, which would take $2 billion out, which leaves us then the ability to still invest in the business and deal with some level of continuing episodic expenses and still hit the overall reduction that Vikram and I talked about.","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question maybe in terms of reserve releases. You guys were a little later to that game than some of your peers. So is it fair to assume that maybe at a declining level where we should still see, assuming the environment continues at the current rate of improvement, that we'd see some more reserve releases?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. Given the assumptions that you put out, that if things continue, the environment continues as it is. And don't forget, most of the reserve releases that we're doing now are really tied up in our 2 cards businesses. So it's really a U.S. type of view right now as far as reserve releases. But we continue to see NCL rates decline in that business. We continue to see delinquencies improving. So as long as the overall economy continues as it is now, and it continues to improve, yes, you should continue to see some level of reserve releases.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one quick question on expenses and then we can move on, I promise. Just you had said that the $2.5 billion to $3 billion decline that you expect for 2012 does not include unforeseen episodic issues. But do you bake in an elevated level of legal expense in those assumptions? Because it does seem like that's part of the environment that we're in, at least for the near term.","John C. Gerspach","Yes. I would say that the -- when we're talking about a $2.5 billion to $3 billion reduction, and that works you down to a number. You should assume that in that number, there is some level of ongoing litigation-type expenses. But we wouldn't expect it to be a repeat of 2011 where we had $2 billion worth of episodic legal and related expenses.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then digging in a little bit into the equities results, this is the second quarter where we've had some weak derivatives results weighing down that business. Could you give maybe some color on what happened there and any steps that you might be taking to prevent more of the same?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, let me just start, and then I'll kind of let Vikram maybe finish about things to come. When you look at equities, I think there's 2 things that you got to think about. Overall, for the full year, in equities, our revenues declined by about $1.3 billion. About half of that decline was tied up in the principal strategies business, that prop trading unit that we mentioned last quarter and again this quarter. And that's a unit now where we have completed the wind-down. The other half, as far as the revenue shortfall year-over-year, was really in equity derivatives. And there's certainly at least an element in equity derivatives' performance that is market related. And then there's probably some element of it also that is a bit of an underperformance on our part. But you've got to think in terms of the full year, especially the second half of the year, was definitely impacted by those losses in the principal strategies group, and now we've wound that down.","Vikram S. Pandit","I think the only thing I'd add to that is volatility, volatility was extremely high. And in addition to that, liquidity, even in some of the most liquid markets, like index options and index derivatives, dried up dramatically. And so when you're making markets for your clients, sometimes the market-making reflects -- market-making activity and market-making P&L reflects the underlying nature of liquidity in the markets and was not as good a quarter as we would've liked.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of maybe secondary questions here. But as we think about just the business activity in Securities and Banking and then your position, you did have some comments that you proactively derisked. And obviously, these hedges that you have on has some cost to it. Is there a way to quantify kind of the proactive cost of hedging and derisking? I realize some of it is opportunistic costs, but there is probably some direct costs as well?","Vikram S. Pandit","That's difficult. I mean, obviously, John Gerspach has given you one line on the CDS hedges, and that's one which was relatively difficult. But we got to the numbers to tell you exactly where they are. I think the broader issue is what you have stated. We've derisked a lot of these businesses. And when you have less risk to work, you make less money. And so the opportunity cost is an important piece, including derivatives and other books when you carry a lot of data, and you have a lot of hedges in place that can reduce the amount of revenues you generate. It's very hard to tell you that this is what it cost us because obviously, you can't run 2 businesses side-by-side, one with this and one without. And so that's a difficult exercise. We've chosen just to tell you that we actually ran our books in a very cautious way. And frankly, we thought that was exactly the right thing to do given the uncertainty that Europe represented.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, as we think about capital and the build to get to the 8% to 9% under Basel III, there's obviously the joint venture with Morgan Stanley and the brokerage business. Could you just remind us of when their call date is this year and the process at which they basically to figure out the price and what the impact would be to the capital? I think it might free up 20, 30 basis points or so, just remind us about some of those moving pieces.","John C. Gerspach","Yes, Matt. You pretty much have got it. The call date is -- it's either May 31 or June 1. I can't remember the exact date, but I believe it's May 31. And what will happen is about a month before that time, Morgan Stanley will hopefully notify us of their intent to exercise their call to buy 14% of the joint venture. So that's 14% out of the 49% that we currently own. And if we don't immediately reach agreement on a price, then we each agree on a third-party arbitrator who will come in and set a price.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Am I right that when the deal was struck, there was a deal value of 10? And I think you or at least the media was reporting that the bid-ask spread was like $1 billion or so, plus or minus?","John C. Gerspach","I don't know what the media reports.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions actually have been asked, but if you've been derisking the trading books, should we see any of that in terms of risk-weighted assets coming down?","John C. Gerspach","Chris, I think you'll see a couple of things. One, you can see, certainly in the -- just the level of assets that we've got on our balance sheet right now, balance sheet assets are down. When we publish our K, you'll see that our average VAR is down quarter-on-quarter. More importantly, and something that you won't see though, is the way that we really manage the businesses is by applying a continuous stress test on our businesses. And overall, I say that the stress losses in the second half of this year on our various trading books were reduced significantly compared to the levels that would have existed at the end of the second quarter. You're more likely to see this on a Basel II or Basel III risk-weighting assets. And so that's something that, as we get more into the later part of the year, we can probably talk about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, given that you talked about these expense reductions kind of not like contingent on the environment, I mean, this is what your plan would be kind of in normal course for 2012. And presumably, there are contingency plans above and beyond that, right? I mean, that's -- but I guess the question is, I mean, some of this must be being phased in. And what's the -- what is it going to be in terms of the run rate by the end of 2012? Will it be lower than where we're starting the year?","John C. Gerspach","Moshe, I'm not going to forecast the run rate by the end of 2012. But again, when you're talking about things being phased in, and I don't mean to continuing to beat a dead horse, but we have an ongoing cost reduction program built into each one of our businesses. And so we are continuously taking cost out of the business. Last year, we did take $1.9 billion of expense out of our businesses. Now we chose to invest $3.9 billion, an incremental $3.9 billion in the businesses, so that overwhelmed the cost reductions. But as we pare down on increasing that level of investment, the cost reductions that we've got can cover the level of investment and actually drop some cost savings to the bottom line.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Maybe just to kind of flesh that out, because I think in response to an earlier question, John, you had said that you would be increasing those investments. When you meant increasing, you meant increasing above 0 from like a 0-based budgeting-type of thing?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. If you take today as saying, okay, the level of investment spending that I've baked into the business is now my -- my now 0-based. We will be increasing that level of spend. We're going to open up more branches.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And presumably, given the fact that you've talked about kind of reaching a positive expense leverage in more -- in the entire company as opposed to just portions of the company, that $1.9 billion number should be a larger number, as well as the $3.9 billion being smaller?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg with Barclays Capital.","Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, I guess, a bit of clarification. I guess it looked like trading fell off, as you mentioned, a lot in the last 3 weeks of the year, given your comments earlier in the quarter. But was that -- I guess you mentioned principal strategies. Was that just more derisking you did in the last 3 weeks? Was that tied to the year-end kind of mark process? Or just maybe a bit more color in terms of what actually drove that?","John C. Gerspach","Well, principal strategies was a business that we were winding down throughout the second part of the year. So that in and of itself wasn't a last 3 weeks of December rush on it. So that -- you can kind of take that off the table. December was just a month that we saw as being remarkably weak. I'd characterize this December as being something beyond what we would normally expect to see in seasonality. It just -- people just sat on the sidelines, and we just didn't see a lot going on during the month of December.","Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then in your comments, you mentioned that mortgage re-default rates were coming in better than you had expected. I guess, any kind of hypothesis in terms of what's driving that?","John C. Gerspach","Well, when you get into the HAMP process, assuming you've done it correctly, you basically have reunderwritten the loan and it's actually quite an extensive process. And our re-default rates now on our HAMP modifications are running at something less than 15%. So that's clearly below certainly the expectations that us or the industry would have normally had going into the process. And then some of that carries over into just the normal modifications that we do. And I'd say that we're in an enhanced modification mode. And so even on our non-HAMP modifications, the re-default rates are running less than 25%.","Jason M. Goldberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Interesting. And then I guess, just lastly, obviously, you're moving Retail Partner Cards back into Citicorp. OneMain Financial, I guess, been a lot of discussion around that, just your thoughts around the ultimate outcome for that unit?","John C. Gerspach","Well, OneMain Financial, again, that's a unit that we'd like to find a buyer for. And I think that, that's where that's going to stay. It's a business that's a good business. You take a look at the -- some of the information we give you in the appendix slides, it's generating positive pretax income now for several quarters in a row, but it's just not a business that we see fitting with the strategy of Citicorp. So it's hard to see how we would just suddenly decide to make a transfer of that into Citicorp. That's just one that we're going to have to find the right buyer at the right time and deal with it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. John, you mentioned one of the -- what appears to be one of the major benefits of some of the deleveraging of the European banks. I'm curious outside of Transaction Services, more in the lending businesses, are you seeing obvious signs there where you're gaining market share as a result of some of the pullback of the European banks? And does that -- do you expect that to help your loan growth this year?","Vikram S. Pandit","I think the most obvious place where you see it is in Trade Finance, and that's a pretty big number in terms of increase. And I think we can continue to see good momentum there, particularly given our global network. Corporate lending is a little bit more sporadic in the sense that not every corporation needs the liquidity. Lots of corporations, even in Europe, have a lot of cash. We think that some benefit may also accrue in terms of capacity or rationalization and things like derivatives markets and those kind of places where pricing structures may change on that. And so I think the bigger impact, as I said, the European banking system has a gross number of about $40 trillion of assets. As you can guess, that's substantially larger than the U.S. It depends on how you measure it and all of that, but it is a multiple. That number is coming down. And as that number is coming down, it's going to impact a lot of different aspects and not only in terms of product lines, but also geographically. I think the emerging market businesses are ones where we are quite present. And as I said earlier, the numbers that we understand, a 65% of emerging market debt is held by the European banking system. Well, that creates certain types of opportunities there as well. So it has to play out. It's going to play out in a very steady way because we've got to underwrite everything as carefully as we underwrite anything else. But the trends are certainly in the favor of those banks that have the capacity to step in.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And if I can, just a couple of quick questions on the consumer side of things. Domestically, are you still sticking to your goal of achieving positive operating leverage in North America basically this year? And has that accelerated at all given some of the positive trends you saw this quarter?","John C. Gerspach","I'm not going to accelerate the guidance on that at this point in time, but we do -- we are reaffirming that. We expect North America Regional Consumer Banking to generate positive operating leverage by the end of this year. But I'm not going to advance that timeline just yet.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. And on EMEA consumer banking, the credit trends there look quite good in the fourth quarter, certainly relative to the last couple of quarters. I guess that surprises me a little bit given some of the concerns raised in the media about the slowdown in several of the economies in Western and Central Europe. I guess I'm just curious how you're thinking about the potential for credit trend weakening in the consumer businesses in EMEA, given all the challenges in the Eurozone?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. We actually -- as you've noted, we really haven't seen that impact on our consumer business. Now remember, even in EMEA, it's the same strategy as we have everywhere around the world where we're focused on a specific customer segment. So -- but we're -- again, EMEA is a rather smaller part of our consumer franchise, but we don't see issues right now with our book of business in EMEA.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A quick question on the lending business and the S&B. You highlighted the variances from the hedge gains and losses. Just wanted to understand what some of those big drivers are.","John C. Gerspach","I'm sorry, what are the big drivers in the hedge gains and losses?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, what's driving the variance there?","John C. Gerspach","Counterparty spreads.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So then a follow-up is just given the downgrades that happened. I mean, I know it's at a country level last week. Does that impact what kind of gains or losses you'd be expecting this coming quarter?","John C. Gerspach","No, no. I mean, I don't want to say that a lot of our book is certainly -- there's not a lot of our book that's concentrated in Western Europe, which is where I think you've seen those downgrades that you're talking about. And then there's always that question as to whether or not the country rating drives down the corporate or the financial institution of rating. So most of our CDS hedges are against either individual -- these are specific hedges against the risk in our loan portfolio. And so they're either single-name risks or something where we've been able to construct a hedge against an industry group. But it's really not tied back into what you may be thinking about, Betsy, as far as the European sovereign CDS. That's not what we're talking about.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is there anything else that the recent downgrades at the country level would impact your look forward?","John C. Gerspach","Would impact my what?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your look forward?","John C. Gerspach","Look forward? No, no. Not from where we're positioned right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Steve dialing in for Gerard. Starting Holdings, how much of the expenses -- what percentage would you say is legal in nature?","John C. Gerspach","I don't have that. I've got the growth year-on-year. But when you take a look at the episodic expenses in Holdings for this year, I'd have to guess at it, Gerard (sic) [Steve]. And so -- I'm sorry, I just don't have that in front of me.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And also, just your loan loss reserves. Recognize that they're set by classified loans. Do you see that in a normalized credit environment that you'll get it below 2% from where it is right now? I think it's at 4%?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, it's a little over that, actually. It's 4.7%. Don't forget, that's a mix of both a corporate business and consumer business. I think you're going to naturally have slightly higher reserves in your consumer business, so I don't think we would get down to having an LLR ratio of 2% for the whole business. I don't want to sit here and forecast one for you, but 2% would sound pretty aggressive to me.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And just last question, and I apologize if this has already been mentioned. What are you expecting for your tax rate in 2012 effective?","John C. Gerspach","Well, we don't talk about forecasting individual year tax rates. I'd say that as we continue to get back to a more normal operating environment, our tax rate should be something in the high 20s. In the, say, 28% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just quickly in terms of the Volcker proposal, we know the comment period ends next month in February. And assuming -- well, we don't know the rules, assuming the final rules come out later this spring for January implementation next year, how should we kind of think about the repositioning or kind of the timeline in terms of implementing that rule, so to speak? Is that kind of a second half 2012 kind of event? I mean, how should we kind of think about the residual impact of that proposal?","Vikram S. Pandit","That's a logistically difficult question obviously, because there are tremendous amount of details that yet we need to know about, and we don't know what they are. A lot of that has to do with the certifications and other things up and down the chain in terms of proprietary trading and how you approach making market. So let me answer it this way, I think the broad-based approach to Volcker, which is about prop trading, private equity, other things that we've already started making and those changes are occurring, as John said earlier, a lot of them are behind us, some more things to be done. But a lot of them are behind us. In terms of sort of the mechanics of putting in place a system we've started, obviously, as best as we can, but I can't tell you exactly when everything is going to come online yet because I don't know all the details.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess I'm more specifically talking about the fixed income component as opposed to the equities component, which is obviously more clear cut.","Vikram S. Pandit","Again, I can't tell you off the top of my head exactly when it all comes together.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just kind of a follow-up to the earlier discussion in terms -- Vikram, you mentioned Asia and your positive outlook there. Could you just -- and John perhaps, too, just give us a little bit more flavor, color in terms of just the restructuring and the repositioning that you've been doing in both EMEA and Asia. As you mentioned before kind of the secular component? But I'm just curious just kind of what -- the profitability was just less than expected this quarter in particular. I'm just wondering, again, how we should think about that business, how you're repositioning it and going forward?","Vikram S. Pandit","I mean, let me talk about it this way. The biggest broad-based repositioning is towards less resources in some of the more developed markets and more resources in the emerging markets. That's a very big, broad piece. I think that works through all our businesses, Consumer, Securities and Banking, et cetera. But that's one big piece. The second big piece of restructuring is still towards those businesses that are more services-oriented, local consumer banking, those kind of -- restructuring towards the kind of activities that allow us to serve our clients by providing them services and loans. That's the second type of restructuring. Third type of restructuring is in reaction to our view as to what volumes are going to be in the different product areas. I think it is clear to us that some of the credit markets, securitization markets, some of the other derivative markets are going to have different kind of volumes than what we've been used to. We've been restructuring towards that. We've been restructuring towards volumes that may be lower as a result of Basel III charges in certain areas as well. So that's the third big round of restructuring. And I guess, on the volumes, the last part, I would say, is our general view is that with more companies, that will over time go public and more credit markets in the emerging markets that we're skewing our resources a little bit more in that area. So that's the big picture kind of perspective which -- John, you want to add to that?","John C. Gerspach","Well, I just -- when you take a look at Asia, don't forget that in this quarter, we actually had -- that Japan DTA write-down impacted the Asia geography. So when you're taking a look at Asia's results in Citicorp, about $120 billion -- $120 million of the write-off, I think it's $122 million of the write-off, impacted that. So that's a direct impact on the bottom line. The other thing is, Asia, the consumer business we talked a little bit about having an impact on lower investment sales this quarter. So that certainly impacts both the quarter-on-quarter, as well as the year-on-year comparisons. And when you take a look at what went on in Securities and Banking, they actually had a blowout quarter in the third quarter. So you're comparing fourth quarter to a blowout third quarter, which makes any sort of comparison difficult. They are down, revenues from where they were last year, and that's got a little bit to do with the equities derivatives market where we had a bit more of that impact hit us regionally in Asia than anything else. So I think there's just a couple -- it's a couple of singular events that hit in the quarter like the DTA write-down. And then some of it is a bit of a comparability issue where they had such a strong third quarter that it's a little difficult to compare fourth to third.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, John. And so I'm just assuming again just all else being equal that, again, that the positive operating leverage kind of where we were year-over-year that, that would be the expectation for 2012 as well?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. Certainly, our Asia consumer banking business, which is the one that we were giving that guidance on, we expect that positive operating leverage. Now that they've had it 2 consecutive quarters, we expect that to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My question relates to the balance between investing for growth then shrinking for profitability. And the reason I ask that is just looking at the operating leverage. Quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, 3 years, 5 years or 10 years, it looks like you've had negative operating leverage. So the real specific questions would be, number one, are you cutting enough? With revenues down $8 billion last year, you're looking to cut $2.5 billion to $3 billion. It seems like maybe you could cut more. The second question is, are you investing too much? If you look at the gap between revenues and expense, the growth last year, I get $11 billion taking your numbers. It might be $9 billion or $10 billion, but you're still going to invest, I guess, $4 billion or more taking last year's level. And the third question is perhaps, can you reduce the number of countries where you do business?","Vikram S. Pandit","Let me start. John, you answer as well. Let's be clear. I think in any business like ours, you got a little bit of both going on. For example, we are investing against the emerging market consumer businesses because we expect them to grow. And at the same time, we've also demonstrated operating leverage which just is exactly to your point, which is having made the investments to start with. From here on, we expect them to self-fund a lot of the growth that's going to come from there. That's an example. We then go to our next business, which is the U.S. consumer business. We talked about investing in that. A lot of what we had to do is normalize some of the marketing spend in cards and as well, for that matter, in the consumer business, normalize marketing spend around the world. We've done that and we expect to see operating leverage coming out of that business as well. That's investment, but investment in a way that we think generates the operating leverage. Then you go to GTS. We've talked about that as well. There, we expect operating leverage sometime this year, middle of -- middle-ish of this year, something of that sort. And then you really get to the Securities and Banking business, which we've talked about before. That is a business which has been impacted by a combination of regulation, market uncertainty, volumes, a variety of different things. And that's a business where we are doing a little bit of both again. And by that, I mean that in certain of our local market foreign exchange businesses, local market consumer businesses -- not consumer, of trading businesses, there are some tweaking required in terms of investment. But by and large, there are large amount of businesses where we have reduced the amount of resources and hence the restructuring charge. So that's sort of the full picture of what's going on. I think John also stated that $3.9 billion may have been the investment number last year, but that's not the number next year. It's not going to be 0, but it's not going to be $3.9 billion And again, geared towards this kind of operating leverage momentum that we've started creating and plan to create going forward. Now that's to us the pattern of our investment and disinvestment, and it's consistent with where we think growth and earnings are going to come from going forward. John, you want to add to that?","John C. Gerspach","The only thing I'd say, Mike, when you take a look at the revenues and you take a look at the overall Citigroup revenues, don't forget that one of the single biggest driver of the revenue reduction year-over-year is the revenue reduction in Citi Holdings. Citi Holdings revenues are down 33% year-over-year, as you would expect, because we're driving the assets down. So maybe a better way to look at it would be just on the Citigroup -- Citicorp plus Corp\/Other. And again, there, certainly, we had revenues down year-over-year. It's 12%. And then you get into the individual business characteristics that Vikram mentioned, and that's really where we're focused. But I think we've got clean line of sight to positive operating leverage in the International Consumer Banking businesses, in North America Consumer Banking business, in GTS and the discussion keeps on coming back to what can we do to Securities and Banking, and that's a business that we are very focused on.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess, if you strip this a few ways, you can still come up with negative operating leverage even at Citicorp revenue is down over $3 billion.","John C. Gerspach","It is. It's down this year. You don't have to strip it out, it's down.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess the general question is, Vikram...","John C. Gerspach","The question is where we're going forward?","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, Vikram, are you satisfied with the operating leverage the way it is today? I guess that's the core question.","Vikram S. Pandit","We would like to see better markets and therefore, we'd like to see more revenues in Securities and Banking. That, to us, has been the biggest delta on a year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter basis. No, I'm not happy with those revenues in those businesses. A lot of that's related to the market. Some of it is related in terms of our continuing to execute in the right way. But what John said is important. The plan is -- has been to use 2011 as a year where we've made some of the catch-up investments, re-normalize some of the investments, put money to work where over the -- from 2008 through 2010, we had operated businesses very tightly, and to use 2012 as a year where we would start showing you operating leverage business by business by business.

Just are you satisfied with the expenses that are under your control, that you're doing really everything that you can?","Vikram S. Pandit","The answer to that is, yes. And not only that, I think John talked about $1.9 billion of reengineering. We have a robust reengineering plan in place. Don't forget that John also talked about a couple of billion of one timers in legal. No, I'm not happy with those, and those are not the kind of expenses we want to see recur as well. But the company and the businesses are on top of driving operating leverage and operating efficiency, and we are focused on keeping our expense base as low as possible, just as we are in this environment focused on keeping our risk under control and keeping a lot of liquidity on our balance sheet because we do continue to see a lot of issues out there, particularly in Europe, that we are all going to have to be prepared for.","Operator","Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up.

With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael L. Corbat","Thank you Susan and good morning everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the third quarter of 2015 or $1.31 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. The quarter had more than its fair share of volatility and our results speak to the resilience of our franchise globally. And despite the revenue headwinds we once again proved our ability to manage our expenses and will remain on track to deliver our full year efficiency and return on asset targets. ","I feel good about the quality and consistency of the earnings that we have demonstrated through the course of the year. We have also made strong progress against our other core priorities. We achieved both positive operating leverage and continued loan and deposit growth in our core businesses. We continued to improve the quality of our balance sheet by replacing legacy assets from Citi Holdings with high solid loans in Citicorp. ","Citi Holdings was profitable again this quarter, Holdings assets declined 20% on a year-over-year end basis and we will end at 110 billion for the quarter which represents only 6% of Citigroup's balance sheet. We expect to close an additional 31 billion of asset sales during the fourth quarter. We utilized an additional 700 million in deferred tax assets this quarter bringing the total utilization to $2.1 billion through the third quarter which has contributed $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital. In total we generated $14 billion of regulatory capital so far this year and have been able to return over 4 billion of that capital to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. ","We grew our tangible book value to over $60 per share and our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.6% on a fully implemented basis. With one quarter to go we are on track to hit our financial targets in return of assets and our efficiency ratio and we also earned a 10% return on tangible common equity so far this year. ","Turning to the results of our businesses, while the uncertain environment clearly dampened client activity in our market products, we made good progress in other areas. With revenue growth in treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank equities also grew. And while our total fixed income revenues were under pressure we saw continued strength in our emerging market franchise. We also continued to see momentum in M&A year-to-date as a result of investments we\u2019ve made in that business. ","Internationally our consumer banking business was also impacted by slowing growth and shifting consumer sentiment most notably in Asia. In the U.S. our retail franchise continued to grow revenues, loans, and deposits even as we continued to sharpen the focus of our branch footprint. And in branded cards we are seeing growth in active accounts and purchase sales although it\u2019s going to take some time for the full benefit of our investments in this business to be reflected in our results. ","As we look to the end of the year, we still don\u2019t have clarity on many important issues. Predictions on the timing of an interest rate increase seem to change every day. We don\u2019t yet know the long-term impact of recent volatility on consumer and business sentiment. And in many large markets, there are high degrees of political risk which have economic ramifications. ","I think that this quarter showed that we are well equipped to handle what the world throws our way whether it\u2019s managing our risk, our expenses, or our capital. Challenging environments have become the norm and the work we\u2019ve done to make our firm simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger has given us a resilient and sturdy platform from which to operate. John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John. ","John C. Gerspach","Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA, DVA, on our reported results. Excluding this item we earned $1.31 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. On slide 4, we show a total city group results. In the third quarter we earned $4.2 billion generating a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 8.9%. Revenues of 18.5 billion were down 8% from last year mostly reflecting an impact of foreign exchange translation. ","In constant dollars revenues declined 2% year-over-year as the slight improvement in Citicorp was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings. Expenses declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as the benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a significantly lower net loan loss reserve release. ","Turning to the first nine months of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56.5%. Net income grew about 22% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 99 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined to 1% year-over-year to 622 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued line down of Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat versus last year at 904 billion also reflecting 4% growth in Citicorp offset by a decline in Citi Holdings. ","On slide 5, we provide more detail on third quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up slightly year-over-year and Citi Holdings revenues declined by nearly 30% mostly reflecting higher gains on asset sales in the prior year including the impact of selling our consumer operations in Spain and Greece. On slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citicorp expenses were down 13% year-over-year driven by significantly lower legal and repositioning cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets. ","On slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Year-to-date Citicorp has contributed over 97% of our net income while Citi Holdings although profitable has had a limited impact on total earnings. As I just described we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with revenues up slightly and expenses down 13% in constant dollars. And for the first nine months of 2015 we achieved a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.4%. Citi Holdings remained profitable this quarter and ended the period with $110 billion of assets. ","On slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total international consumer banking revenues grew 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, excluding the gain of approximately $180 million this quarter on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression. ","Card loan balances in Mexico remained under pressure this quarter reflecting both slower economic growth and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior. However, we were able to offset this impact with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. Overall, we are maintaining a strong share of consumer loans and deposits in Mexico and importantly credit continues to perform well which I will discuss more in a moment. ","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressure in cards. We saw an industry wide slow down in activity in Asia during the quarter reflecting changes in consumer sentiment driven by slowing economic growth and the recent volatility in the capital markets. ","In retail banking we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance, and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by lower investment sales revenue. And in cards we saw a slower than expected growth in purchase sales this quarter. Card loans still grew modestly year-over-year but this growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates. And regulatory changes remained a headwind as well although we continued to believe this will abate somewhat as we go forward. ","In total, average international loans grew 3% from last year, card purchase sales grew 5%, and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses grew 1% as higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments were mostly offset by lower legal and repositioning cost as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit cost increased 7% from last year driven by our loan loss reserve build in Latin America. ","Our NCL and delinquency rates continued to improve this quarter in Latin America. However, given the macroeconomic environment we did build another loan loss reserves in particular in Brazil. We have taken a cautious approach in Brazil for several years now including the sale of our mass market credit card business, Credicard in late 2013. At less than $3 billion, the Brazil consumer portfolio now represents just 1% of our global consumer loans and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our total consumer cost of credit as we look forward. ","Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of 1.3 billion grew 3% from last year as continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads were partially offset by the impact of $15 million mortgage repurchase reserve release in the prior year. ","In branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and rewards cost as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. We feel confident that we now have the right products to drive high quality account growth. ","We expect the investments we are making today to generate higher net interest revenue overtime as growth in active accounts, better customer engagement, and higher purchase sales translated to higher full rate balances. We feel good about our progress to date of nearly 6% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 12% growth in purchase sales in our core products. Of course this has the revenue growth in cards will take some time and the full benefits of our actions may not be completely reflected in our results for perhaps another two years as we build new loans to offset the continued run off in our legacy products. In the interim we will benefit from inorganic growth next year with the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. ","Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 2% from last year reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices as well as higher contractual partner payments, as we continued to share some of the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with our retail partners. Excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, pretax income grew 7% in retail services. Total expenses of 2.3 billion in North America declined 6% as incremental investments were more than offset by lower repositioning cost and ongoing efficiency savings, as we have continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. ","Since the beginning of 2014 we have closed or sold over 200 branches and plan to exit roughly 50 more by the end of the first quarter of 2016 including our Boston area branches. With these actions we are concentrating our presence in our most productive urban markets and also adjusting our model to reflect a significant shift in transaction activity to digital channels requiring fewer branches and lower headcount per branch. This shift also improves our ability to retain customer relationships as the physical footprint changes. Even when we exit the market entirely, we have found that we are able to retain a significant portion of the consumer deposits overtime. ","Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Asia credit was stable again this quarter with a loss rate of roughly 80 basis points. The loss rate in North America continued to decline to 2.2%. And both the NCL and delinquency rates improved again this quarter in Latin America driven by favorable trends in our Mexico cards portfolio that we expect to continue. ","Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. For the first nine months of the year the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53% down from 55% last year. And we expect the ratio to be roughly 53% for the full year.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 12, revenues of 8.4 billion in the third quarter declined 3% from last year. Total banking revenues of 4 billion excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges were down 7% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting lower investment banking activity. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 1.9 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis. ","In constant dollars TTS revenues grew 7% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues of 937 million were down 25% from last year. Equity underwriting revenues were down 43% reflecting lower industry wide activity this quarter. ","Debt underwriting revenues were down 17% driven by high yield and leverage loans, products where our core clients were less active this quarter than in the prior year. And M&A revenues were down 24% compared to a very strong quarter last year. Year-to-date in 2015 we have continued to gain momentum in M&A with 16% revenue growth, sustained wallet share gains, and a strong share of announced value. Private bank revenues of 715 million grew 8% year-over-year driven by strong growth in managed investments revenue as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of 403 million were down 9% on a reported basis. ","In constant dollars lending revenues declined 4% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and the impact of loan sale activity. Total markets and securities services revenue of 4 billion declined 5% year-over-year. Fixed income revenues of 2.6 billion were down 16% as we saw lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in the recent quarter particularly in securitized products in G10 FX. The revenue impact was most significant in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by strong performance again this quarter in our emerging markets franchise where our fixed income revenues grew 4% year-over-year. Our G10 rates business as roughly flat year-over-year for the quarter but we did see significantly lower than expected revenues in the back half of September. ","Turning to equities, excluding the impact of reversing $140 million of the valuation adjustment we recognized in the second quarter, revenues increased by 12% from last year driven by growth in derivatives with particular strength in North America and Asia. And in security services revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. ","Total operating expenses of 4.7 billion decreased 4% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were 309 million up sequentially reflecting a net loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release last quarter. ","In both quarters we built reserves for energy related exposures. However the build was more than offset last quarter by reserve releases in other portfolios. In the third quarter we built energy related reserves of roughly $140 million or about half of the total ICG build. The remainder was split between other portfolios and the impact of overall volume growth. Of course we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the risk of losses actually being realized. Total net credit losses were $34 million this quarter and while corporate non-accrual loans increased during the quarter, more than two thirds of the loans we added remained performing. ","On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months our efficiency ratio was 57% including over 100 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio in the range of 55% to 56% for the full year 2015. ","Slide 14 shows the results for corporate and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year driven primarily by gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Slide 15 shows holdings assets which totaled $110 billion at quarter end, down 20% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in opening down Citi Holdings with signed agreements to selling additional $37 billion of assets, $31 billion of which we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter. By year-end we currently expect Citi Holdings assets to be somewhere in the range of $70 billion to $75 billion. ","On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.4 billion declined 32% from last year mostly reflecting lower gains on asset sales as well as divestiture activity. Expenses also declined driven mainly by the lower assets and cost of credit remains favorable driven by the North American mortgage portfolio where the total NCL rate improved to 1.2%. ","On slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 294 basis points in the third quarter, roughly in line with the prior quarter as trading NIM continued to be higher than expected. ","Looking to the fourth quarter, our net interest margin will depend on a number of factors including the level of trading them, the timing of expected divestitures in Citi Holdings, and a magnitude in timing of any debt redemption actions. Given all that we currently expect our net interest margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 285 to 290 basis points. ","On slide 18 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.6% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization even as we return $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.8% and our tangible book value grew to over $60 per share. ","In summary we continue to operate well in a challenging environment this quarter with continued cost discipline, significantly lower legal and repositioning cost, and great progress towards the wind down of Citi Holdings. Three quarters into the year we have an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 55.4%, a Citigroup ROA of 99 basis points, and we earn the return on tangible common equity of 10%. ","We continued to utilize our deferred tax assets this quarter and we ended the period with a very strong capital position. We are certainly seeing the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results, but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle. We are remaining disciplined on target client strategy and feel strongly to focusing on these higher quality and more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment. ","Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer revenues will likely be roughly flat to the third quarter and in international consumer we expect revenue to be slight to slightly higher than last year on a constant dollar basis as we expect continued modest volume growth with Asia revenues beginning to stabilize. Turning to the institutional franchise, we continue to see good momentum across treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first nine months of the year in constant dollars. ","Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise particularly in M&A. And finally in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.","In Citi Holdings there are series of transactions that will impact the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier we currently expect to close roughly $31 billion of previously announced asset sales including our retail and cards businesses in Japan and one main financial. We will continue with other ongoing portfolio of sales and we also plan to redeem high cost debt. ","As we have said previously we expect the net gain on the sale of OneMain to be roughly $1 billion including the cost of planned debt redemption actions. In addition, we expect to incur gains and losses on other sales including some that maybe recognized through the cost of credit like and we expect to see higher transaction related repositioning and other expenses as we are up. And so on a net basis including the impact of all of these other transaction related items we would not expect the full $1 billion gain on OneMain to fall through the bottom lot. ","Finally for total Citigroup we expect our cost of credit to be roughly flat to the third quarter excluding any impact from the portfolio of sales out of Citi Holdings. And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","James Mitchell","Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a model question. ","Michael L. Corbat","Good morning Jim.","James Mitchell","Hey good morning. Just the asset sales, 31 billion this quarter, potentially 37 billion in total, can you help us think about the impact on capital ratios when they are done?","John C. Gerspach","Well when you take a look at, I gave you that where I thought that Citi Holdings would end up on a total asset basis, GAAP asset basis for the end of the quarter or somewhere in that range of $70 billion to $75 billion of assets. So, we will certainly see a reduction but as we have said in the past particularly the Japan retail business is not risk asset heavy. So, associated with that is $31 billion worth of sales, you are looking at something that might be roughly half of that in risk weighted assets.","James Mitchell","Right, okay. That is helpful, and I guess as we think about even though that is not a huge impact is that, I mean your capital ratios have expanded pretty significantly over the past 12 months. I know this is not a easy question to answer but if you look at your capital return, payout ratio is still below peers with the improvement in ratios sort of now better than most with asset sales, do you think you can get closer to peer payout ratios next year in CCAR or is there anything else we should be thinking about?","Michael L. Corbat","Jim, it is Mike. I would answer that a couple of ways, one is as long as the stock continues to trade below tangible book our primary actions are going to be focused on share buyback rather than dedicating that right now towards dividend. And again we -- as our capital numbers speak, we had another strong quarter, we have had a strong year-to-date in terms of capital generation, and we have got to position the firm overtime to bring that capital back or we are simply creating our own denominator problem. So, we are focused on it. We don\u2019t know CCAR scenarios, we don\u2019t know all the processes yet but again we are very focused on it. ","James Mitchell","Okay, fair enough, I will stop there, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much.","John C. Gerspach","Hi Glenn. ","Glenn Schorr","Hello there. I guess I wanted to start with credit and energy specifically. I mean the performance overall has been great. I hear your comments, and I have heard past comments about mostly investment grade, largely large corporate. I am just, I am sitting back and I listened to some of our energy team and they talked about the death and destruction in the oil patch and I see the large numbers that large banks like yours have and I am trying to square the circle there and say why should we feel good about future reserves or current reserves on the energy books. So, I guess let's just revisit why we take comfort in your exposures and then maybe you could help with talking through what you do have reserved away exposures are, I would appreciate it, thanks?","John C. Gerspach","Alright Glenn, so again as we have said in the past, and I will give you a bit of a run down, our energy related loans, the total exposure remains about constant to where we were last year at about $60 billion worth of total energy related exposure. The funded book has actually gone down slightly to $21 billion during the quarter. And the book does remain primarily investment grade. We have had some downgrades, we have also taken on some new business which in this market you can imagine is not necessarily at the same high level. But the overall book remains two thirds investment grade, down a little bit from -- the funded book remains two thirds investment grade and the overall exposure is still about 80% investment grade. So we feel very good about the credit quality. ","Having said that we continue to work with our clients. We have been building reserves because it certainly is prudent in this environment. We told you that we took a 140 of reserves this quarter, that is roughly equal to what we took during the first half of the year. We took about 100 in the first quarter, 40 in the second. So this is something that we are looking at every day and we are adjusting the provisions accordingly. But it still remains a very high quality book and not one that is necessarily dramatically dependent on the specific price of that. ","Again our exposure, to what you would consider to be close to the well head you know still remains fairly small. Roughly confident about a funded book of about $6 billion and we\u2019ve worked our way through a lot of the reconsideration events of the taking a look at reserve levels. So again all I can say is that it is something that we are looking at and it is something that we still feel really good about. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay, that\u2019s always helpful. One other question I had is just a more high level of which ways do we see your SLR premium ratio as an advantage and there is lot of downsize in Europe, lot of people trying to optimize their own balance sheets, where can we see that playing the role as a positive to help you bring on books of business and just be like basically the high bid?","Michael L. Corbat","Well we don\u2019t always want to be the highest bid there. We like to get business at a reasonable price but you are right we do have a certain advantage with the SLR ratio and we feel that we are using that appropriately. Of course SLR is one ratio, you also take into account what we are doing on all the other ratios. But for instance the strength that we have got on our SLR ratio has enabled us to pursue a little bit more growth in the prime brokerage area and we see that as a way of getting additional penetration into some of our key investor clients. So again we are using it where appropriate but everything that we do is carefully thought out on several plains as you can imagine. ","Glenn Schorr","Yes, I appreciate that, okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matthew O'Connor","Hi, can you just elaborate a bit on why the NIM will be down 5 to 10 basis points what the assumed timing of the OneMain and balance sheet restructuring is part of that?","John C. Gerspach","Why NIM is downsided.","Matthew O'Connor","I am sorry, I think the outlook for 4Q is for the net interest margin percent to be down 5 to 10 basis points and there is obviously a lot of moving pieces that\u2019s going to impact that. But how do we think about core NIM overlaying the impact of OneMain to debt restructuring. I am trying to figure out if it is down that much because of those transactions or is that down that much kind of on a core basis?","John C. Gerspach","No, what we\u2019ve said in the past Matt is that both the Japan retail business as well as OneMain are high NIM producing businesses. So those are high NIM producing businesses and as we shed those businesses that\u2019s going to have an impact on our NIM and take it down several basis points. I can\u2019t remember the exact number that we gave you last quarter. ","Unfortunately I can\u2019t predict the timing of the sales when they will occur in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter is going to be somewhat of a transition quarter regarding NIM which is why I am giving you a range of 285 to 290. Once we cross the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be able to give you better guidance as to how NIM will progress in the future including don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll be bringing on the Costco portfolio in the second quarter of next year, so that would give us the ability to recapture a portion of that NIM that we are losing through the OneMain sale. And we will also make some of it back through debt buybacks, etc. but I apologize, the fourth quarter is going to be a little bit noisy from a NIM point of view and it is really going to be dependent upon the timing of all of those actions. ","Matthew O'Connor","So as you think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin, essentially a good kind of 1Q 2016 level, just holding rates, holding mix, and holding all that steady how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you are expecting in 4Q?","John C. Gerspach","Again I\u2019ll be in a much better position to give you that type of guidance and we will give you that type of guidance when we get finished with the fourth quarter and I know when these sales have closed and what impact they will then have on our reported NIM.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay, and then just separately the Costco deal you mentioned the portfolio coming on in the second quarter has that been finalized in terms of pricing and everything?","John C. Gerspach","No, it still hasn\u2019t been finalized yet. Obviously we are still in a process, working through a process with AMEX and with Costco and with Visa, all being guided by the terms of the contracts that exists currently between AMEX and Costco and that is really all I can say about that. ","Matthew O'Connor","Okay, alright, thank you. ","John C. Gerspach","Alright. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. ","Michael L. Corbat","Hi.","Brennan Hawken","So in the -- just following up on the Holdings questions in the sale of assets that you expect to close here in the fourth quarter, is there an updated sense about how much of the expense base of Holdings should come out on the back of this?","John C. Gerspach","We haven't given that guidance. We will give you a better sense again after these deals close. You can imagine that associated with certain of these deals there are continuing transaction service arrangements where for a period of time we will be in a position of supporting the buyer with that business which means that we will retain a certain amount of the expense base into the future for which we will be paid. So, again once we determine the timing of all of these transactions and we finalize the terms of the sale including any ongoing service arrangements, I will be in a much better position to give you guidance on the impact on the Holdings expense base. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thank you. And then thinking about another exit but more recently announced Boston, can you give some color maybe on how much you think that might impact the North American GCB efficiency ratio or any other metrics?","John C. Gerspach","Well I told you where we expect to end the year with the efficiency ratio global consumer and that's really what we are focused on. We intend to end there at 53% of that that we basically have now. And we haven\u2019t given any future guidance on operating efficiency ratios but it is safe to assume that in the current environment we are looking to maintain those efficiency ratios in the ranges that we have said that are our targets. So the exit of Boston is part of that overall consideration and so I wouldn\u2019t think about it as being any more accretive to the year-end target of 53% that I gave you earlier. ","Brennan Hawken","Sure, I wasn\u2019t referring to a go forward rather than the year end but let me try a similar idea but maybe in a broader scope, so when we think about the efficiency ratio here and if we think about a revenue environment which is clearly difficult, I know you made reference in the past to the efficiency and then the need for revenue. But if the environment remains difficult, do you have the ability to pull levers and work the efficiency ratio down further from here or are we going to be in a waiting game until the revenues can come through, just how should we think about that?","John C. Gerspach","I don\u2019t want you to feel as though you are in a waiting game but what we have said is that we intend to operate the business with an efficiency ratio. And the efficiency ratio target that we have put out for Citicorp and we have put this out more than two and half years ago now, when we were looking at what we thought would be a difficult environment in 2015 and the environment has actually proved to be even more difficult I think than we thought at that point in time when we said we can operate overall Citicorp with an efficiency ratio of in the mid 50s. And that's where we are. And given this environment we still feel, again we haven\u2019t worked our way all the way through our budget considerations and everything else but in this type of environment we think that that is a pretty good efficiency ratio to be operating under. And it takes a lot of management in this type of environment to continue to operate at that efficiency ratio and still have room to make the investments that you want us to make so that when the environment improves we can generate even higher levels of revenue growth. So, all of that is tied up in those efficiency ratio targets that we have put out there. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay, I guess last one from me then if we think about your new card offering how is it that you would recommend we measure success based upon the change, the new products that you\u2019ve put out the \u2013 the offering what metrics would you guys us to look to if some of the components of the environment for revenue remain challenging?","John C. Gerspach","The metric that will guide you to and will begin to give you more of this probably next quarter, we\u2019ll be taking a look at our active accounts. I think that is where we\u2019re seeing the big difference. I mentioned active accounts are up 6% year-over-year and that\u2019s a big change for us. As I said we were struggling before to maintain a steady state of active accounts and so to see active accounts up 6% this year now basically compared to last year, that\u2019s pretty sizeable growth for us. ","I talked about the fact that acquisitions on our core products were up 37% on a year-to-date basis. But having those acquisitions is good, having those acquisitions really transition into active accounts is where we need to be, and that\u2019s clearly where we have gotten to now and where we are going to keep on driving. So we\u2019ll give you metrics on active accounts. ","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for that John. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","John McDonald","Thank you. John, just wondering on expenses, the year-over-year constant dollar expense trends look good. You are down 13% year-over-year. It is harder for us to kind of tease out how much of that was from lower legal and repositioning to compare to core expense, could you shed any light on that on how the core expenses trend on a constant dollar basis?","John C. Gerspach","You know core expenses are up slightly and again it\u2019s in line with the plans that we had going into this year when we thought about what we needed to do in order to generate the efficiency ratios that we were targeting. So again a plus slightly but all included in the efficiency ratio target that we gave. ","John McDonald","Okay and as you look ahead to the fourth quarter any thoughts on the core expenses, we can probably be in the same neighborhood are there any puts and takes to think about?","John C. Gerspach","Well it is going to vary business by business and everything. For instance in some of the businesses where we\u2019ve seen some of the revenue challenges, for instance some of the international consumer businesses, you can imagine that we have already begun to look at the core expenses there and have begun to adjust the trajectory. So these are all things that we look at. I am not going to give you specific guidance on exactly where core expenses is going to be. But again what we\u2019re committed to is to deliver on that mid 50s of efficiency ratio for Citicorp. ","John McDonald","Okay and then this question is for Mike following up on your comments about using excess capital and trying to avoid the denominator problem. You have become more interested in trying to grow assets in organically as your capital grows and perhaps you get more comfortable with the regulatory rules and whether its card portfolios or consumer books. Is that something that you look more to in trying to grow through portfolio acquisitions? ","Michael L. Corbat","I think John we\u2019ve been open to those acquisitions whether it was best buy or whether it will be Costco. But all of those need to be in our targeted segments. You are not going to see us going out breaking into a new products or things that we don\u2019t view today as really being core who we are as a franchise and whether that\u2019s the client segment or whether that\u2019s by geography or industry or whatever it maybe. But we are wide open to those portfolio acquisitions and if they hit our ROA and our return metrics and we think risk adjusted they make sense. We\u2019ll certainly look at them but again what we have really tried to build our business model around is just really driving our own organic core growth off of our existing platforms. ","John McDonald","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Mike Mayo","Hi, when will we hear about new targets for 2016 and what -- can you give us a preview?","Michael L. Corbat","Sure, well first as you can imagine in this environment we are really focused on delivering 2015 and our targets around that. So it will be some time as we get into the new year. We haven\u2019t set a date as to when we will do that. John said we are heading into budget season and we will be looking both at 2016 and some planning beyond that. I would say that some preview around that Mike is that, as John said, that when we went into these targets two to three years ago we said it is a tough environment. It is probably stayed as tough or tougher both from an economic or regulatory just overall backdrop than we had even thought at the time. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it is going to get a whole lot better here for a period of time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect big changes to those targets. Our goal is to manage the institution well through the environment we are in and be in a position to deliver strong performance, strong operating leverage, and all the things you would expect as the environment at some point in the future starts to turn. ","Mike Mayo","So how much does getting where you want to be depend on higher U.S. interest rates?","Michael L. Corbat","Well it is certainly -- it certainly hasn\u2019t been a help in terms of where we are. And where we are as we said we would get and run the institution to the mid 50s and again I think as you look across the industry it leaves us in a reasonable position. We have talked about changes in interest rates and as of now roughly 100 basis points upward shift of rates translate somewhere into about 2 to 2.1 of revenue which we would hope we believe largely translates into EBIT and so they are tailwinds that can come out of some of those shifts. But again as we have seen, as the Fed has contemplated its move you would want those moves to come on the back drop of perception of economic strength. And if economic strength is there you get the double tailwind of not just the rate push but you get some stability, you get some markets trending, you get some confidence back in the market that I think would be welcomed by both consumers as well as the institutions and corporate. ","Mike Mayo","I mean is it fair for us to expect to a little bit higher returns. I mean you are shedding some non-core assets, you are repositioning the firm, you just announced you are retreating some from Boston and I guess Korea has passed some of the restructuring. I mean is it fair for us to expect a bit more if you look out?","Michael L. Corbat","I think a lot of that Mike depends on the environments there. But what you can expect is that we are going to continue to closely manage the place and we are going to keep an eye. And management has a strong eye towards the targets that we have put out there delivering on those and continuing as I said in opening remarks not just around expenses but around risk of capital to try and manage the place smartly. ","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up. The IMF and other forecasters have reduced their growth rate for Asia and this quarter saw some pull back in China markets but here you are saying on this call that Asia consumer is stabilizing, so can you help me with that disconnect?","John C. Gerspach","When you take a look at the IMF, they have lowered their growth forecast but they are still forecasting growth. And when you take a look at our Asia consumer revenues we believe that they will stabilize. They are stabilizing now and they should stabilize going into the fourth quarter and then into next year. So, I don\u2019t think that those two things are inconsistent. I would like to get more growth out of Asia but with the lowered -- with everybody sort of living in a lower GDP environment, getting high levels of growth is going to be difficult even with the levels that you are seeing, that we are seeing now. Again we are still getting good engagement on loans, on deposits, so it is not that we are not seeing some levels of growth even at this point in time. ","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you show where -- the Citi Holdings as you bring the assets down, I think you pointed out that today the assets represent about 6% of total assets and 13% of risk weighted assets. So clearly there is more capital supporting the Holdings suite we have always known about. Do you think that when you bring it down actually to zero, will all that capital be freed up or is there some operational risk that the regulators will require you to maybe keep more capital in there as the assets are no longer there?","John C. Gerspach","Yes I\u2019d say that is the most likely case Gerard. So when you think about Citi Holdings, Citi Holdings at the end of the quarter had about $157 billion worth of risk weighted assets, at the end of the third quarter Mike. It was $157 billion of risk weighted assets and in that $157 billion consistent with what we said at the end of the second quarter there is about $49 billion worth of risk weighted assets associated with operating risk. And I just don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to get to a point where even if we shut holdings down that we are going to be able to relieve ourselves of that $49 billion of risk weighted assets. So that may come overtime but it\u2019s going to be time not a quarter or two. So I think it is really, you really need to look at the $108 billion then of credit and market risk assets that are supporting to the holdings as really being the opportunity that we have now for further capital reduction and as we wind down the balance of the holdings. ","Gerard Cassidy","Would there be -- thank you for the clarity there. Would there be any operating expenses that have to stick around with that 49 billion of the operating risk assets, when Citi Holdings assets all go to zero would you still have to have some operating expenses to support that 49 billion?","John C. Gerspach","No, we shouldn\u2019t. We have been pretty good at making sure we attack any stranded costs in holdings as we\u2019ve gotten rid of the assets. And this 49 billion it will be driven based upon model. At some point in time we had businesses that generated of operating risk events and it is just going to take time then to have that fade into the past. And then the time frame is just one that we\u2019ll have to work through our own models and then certainly with some of our regulatory friends. ","Gerard Cassidy","Great and shifting gears you mentioned in your prepared remarks about card loans, they grew modestly year-over-year but the growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates than regulatory changes. They both remain headwinds but you then went on to say that you think that the regulatory changes there might be some abatement in this in the upcoming year or was that more just due to the high payment rates that you think that could slowdown to help the growth?","John C. Gerspach","And I think you quoting me from the comments that I made about Asia specifically. And in Asia we had almost every country in Asia implement some version of the U.S. Card Act during the past two years. And so what we have been doing is working our way then through those impacts on the Asia card book, whether that\u2019s higher payment rates, whether that\u2019s lower debt ceilings, items like that. So that has been working its way through the book and what we are looking at now is that the impact of those regulations are abating both because there are not so many new regulations coming new, and also because we are lapping the impact of the changes that were put in place a year or two ago. So both of those factors give us again some of the confidence that those impacts will be lessening as we look forward. ","Gerard Cassidy","And then finally on cards you mentioned that the revenues in branded cards was down about 9% and this was due to the increase in acquisition and reward cost. How long did they last and is that primarily from when you buy a new portfolio or is there an ongoing cost as well just going out reaching out for new customers?","John C. Gerspach","No, this is the cost of growing accounts organically. Two different models as far as inorganic and organic growth but when you get into an organic growth model which is where we are right now predominantly we will get as I mentioned a boost from inorganic growth we had in the Costco portfolio so that will be a big plus. But from an organic point of view the first thing we did is we had to restructure the product offering in cards which I think we have successfully done. And we have gotten a nice balance now of new products dealing with both the value product, rewards product, the value product will be simplicity, the rewards product would be thank you. ","We have introduced double cash giving us a cash back product and so we got a nice balance there between cards that appeal to spend oriented consumers and revolve oriented consumers. We have got a nice balance on our product portfolio between proprietary cards and co-brand cards and now it is a matter of putting investment dollars at work to grow -- to first acquiring new accounts, have them transition into active customers, and then gross spend and revolve behavior on each one of those cards. And so the first phase that you run into once you have restructured is you get into a rebate and reward phase where as you add in those accounts there are certain amount of cost that you incur upfront to acquire the account, all those rebates, and they basically hit your revenue line. As well as then the rewards cost that you pay as they continue to drive spend early on and that also was a, is a muting factor on your revenue line as well. So, once we get through with the -- that will eventually pace itself out and we will go from rebates and rewards and then we will get into a revolving period as well. ","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you for the clarity, I appreciate it. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian","Hi, and just one quick follow-up from me, the roughly 400 million that you called out John and quarterly increase in corporate non-accruals in North America and EMEA, what percentage of that increase quarter-over-quarter was related to energy?","John C. Gerspach","Roughly 80% of the net add was energy related. ","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks. John, just on the debt buyback front can you help us understand as to how much the benefit was this quarter and if the premise of doing more in the future is also baked into your expectation for the future NIM?","John C. Gerspach","The impact of the debt buybacks is incorporated in my 285 to 290 range. You know obviously debt buybacks you get a certain benefit in the quarter in which you do it but it is usually more of a forward-looking benefit. And debt buybacks is just one of the tools that we use as far as active management of our long-term debt portfolio. We find series of debt that just are not particularly trading well and that gives us an opportunity then to buy that back and then usually it ends up giving us the opportunity then to reissue that at better rate. ","Ken Usdin","And was that a modest benefit this quarter?","John C. Gerspach","We had certain, I haven\u2019t been able to isolate it in my head anyway the impact of debt buybacks on this quarters NIM but I am sorry, it is blended in with our overall cost of funding which did come down. And that is something that is really going to -- that is going to trickle in over many, many quarters. ","Ken Usdin","Got it, so it has got a card order which is going to be my follow-up, because I would think you would see a kind of -- you really see it in the cost of debt on the liability side of the average balance sheet page. So I was just wondering if how much benefit you could still get from that going forward?","John C. Gerspach","Well again a lot of that is going to depend on how markets perform and everything else. We have been fairly successful in the past dealing with the debt buybacks. It is something that we look to do. If it is there it is there. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then just a follow up question on the international consumer banking side and to your point about flat year-over-year constant dollar, and your comments about the investments sales slowing, any sense if that investments have slow down, was kind of just customers freezing given what was happening this quarter and what are you seeing just in terms of the international consumer activity aside from revenue just in terms of the behavior and activity as you look ahead?","John C. Gerspach","Activity level obviously it is going vary a little bit region by region but a lot of our wealth management business its concentrated in Asia and there it's very much to your point. What we see in times of market volatility and market uncertainty is that our wealth management clients are not as active as you would imagine. It is just not as active in putting more of their funds to work in the markets and that therefore has an impact on our investment sales. So it\u2019s a little bit of market sentiment, it\u2019s a little bit of consumer confidence, its all of those things and as far as how does what do we think about it going forward at the markets sort of clear themselves as people become a little bit more confident again, they know where they are going. We see that activity come back but this was a particularly tough quarter for investment sales. ","Ken Usdin","Right, okay, got it. Thanks very much. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. ","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. John I had a quick question on risk weighted assets and just wanted to clarify couple of things relating to the disclosure in the release or in the presentation. So it looks as though the headline number has declined about 4% year-on-year but just looking at the capital impact disclosure which maybe reflect some FX related impacts, its looks as though the RWA on a constant dollar basis have been relatively stable. I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about it in 2016 where maybe you don\u2019t have the offset of the holdings run off and you still have continued core growth in Citicorp, should we expect those RWAs to begin to trend on an upward trajectory?","John C. Gerspach","Let me help you. Let me deal with the sequential decline in risk weighted assets, alright. So, on a sequential basis risk weighted assets dropped from I don\u2019t have the page open 12.79 to 12.58, about $21 billion. And roughly half of that decline was FX related, alright. So, don\u2019t forget we take that into consideration as part of our overall capital hedging program because our capital hedging program is built on a ratio hedge. So we hedge to our CET1 ratio. And so just as our capital in various countries is going to be impacted by fluctuations in FX rates, we also know that our risk weighted assets are going to be impacted by that as well. So all of that is baked into capital hedge. But that means that for the quarter we actually saw a non-FX related reduction in RWA of about $10 billion. So that\u2019s what's baked into that number and some of that is in holdings and some of that is in Citicorp. ","In general again we do expect to see Citi Holdings continue to reduce. That should give us room to grow Citicorp. We have not worked our way through our overall 2016 plan as yet. so I cannot give you guidance as to where we are going to think about what we are going to think about RWA levels going into next year. But we\u2019ll take all of that into account as we finalize the budget and as the budget gets finalized around both our efficiency targets as well as our ROA targets and our ROPCE targets as well. ","Steven Chubak","Well thank you for detail there John and just wanted to switch gears for a moment. I appreciate the color that you had given on Brazil in terms of some of the consumer exposures there, one of the things I was hoping you can give some priority or detail on as rolling into corporate exposure specifically, well it looks like Brazil is about 5% of the total loan book. I know in the past the disclosures you\u2019ve given suggest that the majority of those corporates are actually based in Brazil in lieu of other regions or maybe its predominantly multinationals. I want to get a sense as to how your -- what the credit trends look like today, how they are performing, and whether you start to reserve for any potential losses within the institutional segment. ","John C. Gerspach","Our Brazil book is structured in a very similar along the line of every other country in which we operate which is that it is a book that really again focuses on those large multinationals and again it is somewhat similar. We take all of that into account, we certainly been on the wait to see that S&P downgraded Brazil before we began to take a look at some of our Brazil book and build the appropriate reserves. ","But again it is a consistent strategy, large multinational corporates, global investors. At the end of the third quarter we had total exposure of $14.5 billion or so in Brazil and most of that, 75% of the corporate lending book is as you said is the Brazil based companies and a large portion of the book, more than half, well more than half, I think it is like 60%, 70% is TTS related. So it is trade related loans. So you have a combination of short dated secured loans on TTS, large multinationals, I am not going to tell you that the book will never have an NCL but we feel pretty good about the quality of the book. ","Steven Chubak","Excellent and then just one more from me John and obviously you are getting a bit knit picky here but it did sound as though the guidance you have given on the full year efficiency range for ICG is 55% to 56%. I do believe on the last quarter's call you had said the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range which is just maybe some upward pressure on the efficiency ratio and I just wanted to guess as to whether that is a reflection of revenue pressures. I know that revenues on a constant dollar basis were down about 1% year-on-year through the first nine months or more a function of what you are seeing in terms of the performance thus far, maybe your outlook ahead of the fourth quarter?","John C. Gerspach","Yeah, I think the language that we had last time was closer to the midpoint as opposed to specifying the midpoint. So, you can assume that this is, I am thinking that we are going to be slightly above where I would have targeted at the end of the last quarter and it very much reflects the revenue pressure that --","Steven Chubak","Okay, well thanks for clarifying that John. And\u2026","John C. Gerspach","Having said that it is somewhere between 55% and 56% compares really well with our peers. ","Steven Chubak","Tangible [ph] rate, thanks John for taking my questions. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. ","John C. Gerspach","Hi Betsy. ","Betsy Graseck","So, just a couple of follow-ups, one is on corporate, I was going to ask the question about corporates in Asia, you mentioned the slightly softer growth coming out of the consumer, just wanted to get a sense as to how corporates are trending because what we are hearing from folks is that there is a little bit of softer demand given China is not doing as much?","Michael L. Corbat","Betsy, it is Mike. I would say that that's accurate. That there is this activity on the corporate side of the loans and just overall calendar has slowed a bit. That being said, John talked about other parts of our business there in particular our EM sales and trading businesses and our EM sales and trading business in Asia has actually been quite strong. So while headline volumes have slowed, you can imagine through our TTS business, our foreign exchange business in some of those markets, more activity as company's try and position and spend more time focusing on the balance sheet directory running in those companies. So, a bit of in and out but yes, the region is not escaping the slowdown. ","Betsy Graseck","And then just a question on your bond portfolio that you manage globally, I am just wondering are there any opportunities to optimize your investments across geographies or the investments are really just -- in each of the countries that you are generating that deposit flow from?","Michael L. Corbat","You know Betsy, it is a little bit of both. Alright, so obviously we have got a bond portfolio that is at the top of the house but we do have bond portfolios in each of the countries. And so within each of the countries we look to optimize within the country and at the top of the house we look to optimize across the institution.","Betsy Graseck","And is there any more that you can do here, I am just thinking about the relative rate environment, could there be some opportunities for incremental optimization and lower rate environment?","John C. Gerspach","You are having the budget discussion that Mike\u2019s going to have with me is to whether or not my treasury unit is doing the right job, did he subcontract this out to you? ","Michael L. Corbat","Thank you Betsy. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay thanks. ","John C. Gerspach","The answer Betsy is we look at all this stuff all the time and we\u2019re always finding new things that we can do. So, it is something that we do look at every day but I can't give you a specific answer to is there a lot more than we can do. We think we are doing a lot right now. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay and then just lastly on the U.S. credit card environment you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in and they spend and then they borrow, I just wanted to understand was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you are looking for, or is that, when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings. So I am just trying to understand what the two year number was about?","John C. Gerspach","We should see as even as early as next year, we should begin to see growth in our overall loan portfolio. So you should start to see average net receivables. First they will stabilize, maybe that will be very early next year and then we should begin to see some growth. But it is going to take almost that full two years before you see the real full impact of everything that we are doing. We\u2019ll be able to show you metrics along the way so that you will be able to gauge just how well we are progressing. I mentioned to one other caller about giving active accounts but you will also see the growth in ANR. But given the heavy impact of that reward and rebate on the top line revenue it is going to take some time. ","If you think about the 9% down that we have got year-on-year in cards just to maybe give you an example, I\u2019d say about 10% of that decline is environmental, some hangover from regulatory. About 30% of that decline is just the impact of the run off portfolio, the legacy portfolio is running off, and again that will begin to abate as well. But then 60% of that decline is really being caused by this instrument activity that we have. So it won\u2019t always be at that high level but it is going to be at a level for some time. ","Betsy Graseck","I got it, okay, thanks that was very helpful. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Burnell","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. Just one question on loan growth and sort your outlook into fourth quarter. I guess following up on an earlier comment it seems like while there is continued growth expectations across many of your international markets growth expectations are coming down and you reported core loan growth in Citicorp is being at about mid single-digit, are you expecting that to continue at mid single-digit levels over the next quarter or two or are there markets where you think that could slow down substantially?","John C. Gerspach","You know I don\u2019t want to get into a specific guidance point on loan growth in Citicorp on constant dollars but we do think that again, this quarter it did present certain challenges. I don\u2019t think the environment is going to change dramatically in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t look to the fourth quarter as being radically different from what we\u2019ve seen on a sequential basis looking at the third quarter. But again we\u2019ll have to just see how everything continues to develop off of there. What is happening, it is not just of course of the fact that you get loan growth but what also matters is where you get the loan growth and in what loan products do you get loan growth in. And so the key for us is to begin to see the loan growth in those higher margin credit card products. We like to see the loan growth in the retail bank that\u2019s fine but those loans are usually slightly lower margins because they\u2019re securitized. Then there is a fixed payment scheme as opposed to revolving behavior that you have on cards. So loan growth is one thing and I feel pretty good about our ability to grow loans but I feel better when we begin to see even better growth coming out of the card products. ","Matthew Burnell","Okay, John thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in terms of your commentary about credit cost in the fourth quarter, I believe you said that those would be relatively stable with the levels of the third quarter, is that correct?","John C. Gerspach","Other than whatever asset sale impacts we have, some of the asset sales that we\u2019ll be doing out of holdings actually you know the gain or loss gets recognized in that cost of credit line. Outside of those activities it should be stable. ","Matthew Burnell","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, good morning. I just had two quick questions. On the hedge gains that you called out were those related to the specific sector meaning energy or they region like in Brazil or somewhere else that shows the big gain this quarter?","John C. Gerspach","Well I am not going to go into specific things but in general the hedges that we\u2019ve got on our loan book that\u2019s just part of our ongoing risk management efforts. We use loan hedges to manage credit risk concentrations primarily and to the extent that we can and for the most part we do we use single name CDS to hedge those concentration risk. So it is not because we\u2019re worried about any particular name but because we are just trying to manage again our concentration of risk in a particular sector. ","And so in the third quarter as you saw what happened in the environment, credit spreads were generally widening and that had two impacts. We had gains on those loan hedges and at the same point in time we took provisions on the loans. And it shouldn\u2019t be -- that\u2019s in line with the way that you should expect them. I am not going to say it is always going to line up correctly but I think if you go back to the last two quarters what you\u2019ll see in each of the last two quarters to the extent we had small losses on the loan hedges, that gave us then the opportunity it usually matched up with an opportunity to release reserves in the corporate portfolio and to the extent where we had a small gain, we usually had a small build in the loan loss. Again I am not going to say that its perfectly co-related, but it certainly has been somewhat co-related over the last three quarters.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And just switching gears to the mortgage banking, I know you said you wanted to increase the market share there, back to where you were historically or getting closer to it but looks like Q on years not much changed in the market share, as they just left emphasis on growing markets -- market share and mortgage bank or is it just function of the market?","John C. Gerspach","It is not less emphasis it really is very much a function of the market itself. And there is also so it\u2019s a combination certainly of the market. You\u2019ve also seen I think everyone has seen some of the gains on sale being reduced in the mortgage books. So that\u2019s also having an impact on the overall revenue stream that we are getting out of mortgages. But we\u2019re still focused exactly as we were. We are not trying to be one of the top three or four producers of mortgages but we do want to be in a position to be able to support our retail clients when it comes to their mortgage needs. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Good, thanks for taking my questions. ","John C. Gerspach","Not a problem. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. John, I just maybe want to consolidate my understanding of your answers to several of the questions that have come before, so just to preface for a quick second, it seems as if the\u2026","John C. Gerspach","You are not going to go through all 40 questions that have been asked so far are you?","Eric Wasserstrom","No, it's just 37 cause couples are repeats. ","John C. Gerspach","Okay alright. ","Eric Wasserstrom","So it seems as if the overall sort of dynamics is some rebasing of NIM because of change in asset mix and a fairly constant efficiency ratio given the challenges of revenue generation and reinvestment and putting aside maybe some of the volatility in capital markets, it seems then that the primary lever on the income statement for some acceleration in earnings is therefore asset generation, is that correct.","John C. Gerspach","That is one way of looking at it, yes. ","Eric Wasserstrom","And so the -- and so within that, I just want to make sure I understand, it seems that if what you are pointing to as the primary drivers of incremental asset generation meaning beyond the current run rate trends are card in the U.S., retail loan in international consumer, and treasury, PSS, and private bank in ICB is that broadly correct by category?","John C. Gerspach","I think what you have isolated on is what we would consider to be our core banking activities which is exactly where we were focused. And don\u2019t forget, everything that we do starts with having a clearly articulated strategy that we have been consistent with for the past five to six years. And that strategy really guides us along the way. ","The second thing that we are very, very proud of is the strong balance sheet that we have built and so when you start with a well defined strategy and a strong balance sheet that again then gives you the opportunity to pursue appropriate levels of growth. We have gotten to the point now where our core banking activities; cards, retail, PPS, security services, private bank, corporate lending all of those account for more than 75%, close to 80% of our revenues. And that is where we continue to see our growth coming from in the future. ","Eric Wasserstrom","And just in corporate banking, we didn\u2019t hear too much about it on the call, but is there any reason to expect some change in trends line there on quarter review from asset generation perspective?","John C. Gerspach","From asset generation we will continue to support our clients as they need assets whether those be corporate loans or debt or equity underwritings. But our ability to generate assets is really governed by the needs of our clients.","Michael L. Corbat","And John what we may see to Eric's question is that if and as the markets remain volatile we may see corporates choosing to access the loan market versus the capital markets and maybe transition that over time. So, we have seen some periods of volatility. We will probably be asked to put our balance sheet to work and so you could see loan growth coming through the corporate sector in that form as well. ","Eric Wasserstrom","Very interesting, thanks very much. ","John C. Gerspach","Okay. ","Operator","At this time there are no further questions.

If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brett. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, www.citigroup.com. Afterwards we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our 2013 Form 10(k). ","With that said let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for Q3 2014. Excluding the impact of CVA\/DVA net income was $3.7 billion or $1.15 per share.","Before I address the quarter I\u2019d like to discuss the actions we announced regarding Global Consumer Banking. As you know, we\u2019re committed to simplifying our company and allocating our finite resources to the business where we can generate the best returns for our shareholders. Consistent with these priorities we intend to exit our consumer businesses in eleven markets \u2013 among them Japan, Egypt and Peru. We\u2019ll continue to serve our institutional clients in these markets which remain important to our global network.","While these consumer franchise have real value we didn\u2019t see a path for meaningful return. We believe our Consumer business will achieve stronger performance by focusing on the countries where our scale and network provide a competitive advantage. Sales processes are already underway in most of these markets and I expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. At that point we\u2019ll have reduced our Consumer footprint by 19 markets since 2012 and Global Consumer Banking will be serving 57 million clients across 24 markets.","I\u2019d also like to address the announcement we issued earlier this morning regarding a legacy Banamex unit which provided personal security and protective services. While the fraud is not financially material, in light of the conduct we found in the interest of transparency we thought it was best to inform you. As you know we\u2019ve been reviewing our franchise in Mexico and have already made meaningful changes to strengthen our processes and controls, and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that every part of our global franchise lives up to the standards all of us rightfully expect.","Now turning to the quarter: we achieved solid performance across our Institutional businesses. Both Banking and Markets saw improved revenue from prior-year period assisted by a better trading environment and a strong M&A pipeline. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues increased slightly despite spread compression. ","Global Consumer Banking had a strong quarter as well and saw loan growth throughout the regions. In North America we had revenue improvement in each of our businesses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year while we continued to optimize our branch network. Internationally we saw revenue improvements across every region compared to Q3 last year.","Overall these results show solid business performance which has helped increase Citigroup net income by 5% year-to-date over 2013. We also continue to be focused on reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and consuming DTA. These have been execution priorities and we again made progress on both fronts.","In Citi Holdings we closed the sales of our Consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which helped reduce assets during the quarter by 7% to $103 billion. Holdings assets now constitute only 5% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. ","The Holdings profit of $272 million again helped drive DTA consumption. We utilized $700 million of DTA in the quarter, bringing the total to over $5 billion for the last seven quarters. This contributed to our generating nearly $4 billion of regulatory capital this quarter and growing our Tier One common ratio to 10.7%. Our tangible booked value also increased to $57.73.","While we\u2019re pleased with our ability to generate capital we\u2019re equally focused on our ability to return it to our shareholders. During the quarter we continued to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our capital planning process. ","Most important our capital planning process is being fully embedded in the way we run the firm. This must impact everything, from increased business engagement and enhancements to our forecasting models and scenario design processes \u2013 all of which lead to an improved approach to risk and controls. This work will continue as we get closer to receiving the 2015 stress test scenario from The Fed at which point we\u2019ll prepare a strong submission which reflects the work that has been done.","As we finish out 2014 we\u2019re very mindful of the challenging macro environment. Geopolitical tensions, uneven growth and concerns over the timing of interest rate increases have increased volatility. While the economy in the US seems to be slowly gaining strength, the Eurozone is not yet in growth mode and emerging market growth has slowed. ","While our expense reduction efforts have been productive we continue to face pressure related to legal costs and the need to invest in regulatory and compliance, as well as the critical need to protect our network from cybercrime. We\u2019ll remain vigilant along each of these fronts to ensure the safety and soundness of our institution.","John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Thank you. John?","John Gerspach","Okay, thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Let me briefly review the results of the quarter and then I\u2019ll go into more detail on the strategic actions we announced earlier today.","To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items that affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods. First, CVA\/DVA was a negative $371 million pre-tax, or $228 million after-tax this quarter including a $474 million one-time charge due to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments related to certain derivatives. Together these charges had a negative impact on EPS of $0.08 per share this quarter, similar to the CVA\/DVA charge last year. ","And secondly, last year we recorded a tax benefit of $176 million or $0.06 per share related to the resolution of certain tax audit items. Adjusting for these items, we earned $1.15 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.02 per share in Q3 last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation I will be discussing our results excluding these items to provide comparability to prior periods.","On Slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned $3.7 billion in Q3, a 13% increase from last year. Pre-tax earnings of $5.9 billion grew 28% driven by revenue growth and lower credit costs, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. However, our tax rate was higher this quarter at 36%, reflecting a higher level of non-tax deductible legal accruals versus last year as well as higher tax costs related to the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain.","On a year-to-date basis, we generated positive operating leverage with modest revenue growth and flat expenses, and our return on assets improved to 83 basis points. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew slightly year-over-year, to $654 billion, as 4% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat at $943 billion.","On Slide 5 we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related and repositioning costs totaled over $1.3 billion in Q3, mostly incurred in Citicorp. We also incurred $59 million of operating expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain this quarter. Excluding these items core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in Q3 increased by roughly $100 million versus prior periods, primarily reflecting an adjustment to incentive compensation expense driven by better-than-anticipated performance year-to-date in our Institutional franchise. ","Higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to CECCAR and the impact of business growth were more than offset by continued cost reduction initiatives as well as the decline in Citi Holdings assets. ","We expect to incur an incremental $150 million to $175 million of costs in full-year 2014 as we work to enhance our capital planning process. We estimate that about one-third of that amount will be non-recurring. In 2014, the incremental CECCAR-related costs will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. In Q3 we spent an incremental $60 million related to the CECCAR process and we expect this amount to increase further in Q4.","On Slide 6 we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings grew 13% as higher revenues across the franchise and lower credit costs were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Citicorp expense growth was mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning costs, the adjustment to incentive compensation and ICG, and higher regulatory and compliance costs partially offset by efficiency savings. ","In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter with over $270 million in net income compared to a loss of over $100 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $103 billion of assets or 5% of total Citigroup assets.","Before I go into more detail on Citicorp I\u2019d like to cover the strategic actions Mike discussed earlier which will streamline and simplify our Consumer operations. We are exiting our Consumer operations in eleven markets plus our Consumer Finance business in Korea. As you can see on Slide 7 these actions include markets across Latin America, Asia and AMEA. ","Substantially all of these operations were previously classified as \u201coptimized markets\u201d in our country bucketing framework, and while we have made steady progress in many of these businesses we ultimately determined that our scale did not provide for meaningful returns. ","We already have active sales processes underway for over half of the businesses and we currently expect the strategic actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. We expect to report these Consumer operations as part of Citi Holdings as of Q1. We will continue to serve our Institutional clients in these countries which remain important to our global network.","On Slide 8 we provide details on the financial impact of these actions, showing Citicorp on the left and Global Consumer Banking on the right. Over the last twelve months these businesses contributed over $1.6 billion of revenues and $34 million of net income. Total assets were $29 billion as of the end of Q3 including $7 billion of consumer loans; and total deposits were $26 billion.","As shown on the far right, on a pro forma basis our Global Consumer Banking business would continue to capture more than 95% of our existing revenue base while further simplifying our operations and improving our performance.","Now, turning back to Q3, on Slide 9 we show actual results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 22% year-over-year in Q3 driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher legal and repositioning charges. Revenues grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 driven by continued volume growth across the franchise with average loans up 5% and average deposits up 3%; a rebound in investment sales revenues in Asia; and a reduced impact from our repositioning efforts in Korea.","Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs were roughly flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset the impact of business growth as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs. International credit costs declined 13% year-over-year driven by a net loan loss reserve release in the current quarter, while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at just under 200 basis points.","Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 33% year-over-year this quarter driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and continued favorable credit trends. Total revenues were up 5% year-over-year. ","Retail Banking revenues of $1.2 billion grew 9% from last year, reflecting continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds as well as a mortgage repurchase reserve release of roughly $50 million this quarter. ","Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were up 1% versus last year as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans. And Retail Services revenues grew 8% from last year, mostly driven by the BestBuy portfolio acquisition.","Ongoing cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion even after absorbing the impact of the BestBuy portfolio acquisition and higher legal and repositioning expenses. We continued to resize our North America Retail Banking business in Q3, taking costs out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint, all while continuing to grow our franchise.","Over the past twelve months we have sold or closed nearly 90 branches in North America. During this same period we grew average retail loans by 9% and average deposits by 2% including 10% growth in checking account balances. We also continued to see momentum in branded cards. While total average loans have continued to decline modestly this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. ","Full rate balances have grown year-over-year for six consecutive quarters and we continue to see strong growth in accounts and purchase sales in our proprietary Rewards and Travel co-brand products. We also launched our Double Cash card this quarter, which rounds out our product portfolio in the important cash-back segment. ","Slide 11 shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Overall Global Consumer Credit trends remained favorable in Q3, with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America the NCL rate continued to improve while 90+ day delinquency rates were flat. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America we saw a modest uptick in the NCL rate while the delinquency rate improved slightly.","Net credit losses grew broadly in line with our expectations in Q3 driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio as well as the impact of both slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in that market. However, our overall loan growth was slower than anticipated which had a negative impact on the NCL rate for the quarter. This slower loan growth reflected the overall economic environment as well as a higher level of prepayments in our mortgage portfolio. Looking to Q4 we expect the dollar amount of net credit losses in Latin America to be more or less stable.","Slide 12 shows the expense and efficiency trends for Global Consumer Banking on a trailing twelve-month basis. While annual expenses increased in late 2012 and early 2013, driven in part by higher North America mortgage activity, we have driven down the core expense base over the last five quarters even as we have absorbed the impact of higher expenses associated with the BestBuy portfolio acquisition. Including roughly $800 million of legal and repositioning charges over the last year, our total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking was 56%.","Slide 13 shows our total Consumer expenses over the past five quarters split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses continued to decline on a sequential basis in Q3 as we made further progress towards our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. ","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 14, net income grew 29% year-over-year driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $8.7 billion grew 13% from last year and 2% sequentially. Total Banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 11% from last year and were down 3% from the prior quarter. ","Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as growth in fees and volumes was partially offset by spread compression. Sequentially, revenues declined by 2% driven by lower trade assets and spreads.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 32% from last year driven by strong M&A and equity underwriting activity, and down 7% from the prior quarter as continued momentum in M&A was more than offset by seasonally lower underwriting volumes. Private Bank revenues of $663 million grew 8% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression.","Corporate Lending revenues were $442 million, up 17% from last year reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs partially offset by lower loan yields and down 3% from last quarter on lower gains from asset sales. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.3 billion grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. ","Fixed Income revenues of $3 billion grew 5% from last year driven by strength in securitized products as well as an increase in foreign exchange volatility and volumes which benefited our Rates and Currencies business in the month of September. Sequentially, Fixed Income revenues were down slightly as a seasonal decline in spread product revenues was mostly offset by strength in rates and currencies.","Equities revenues of $763 million grew 14% year-over-year driven by improved client activity in derivatives, and were up 16% sequentially on better trading performance. In Securities Services revenues grew 8% year-over-year driven by an increase in client balances and activity. ","Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over prior periods, driven by the compensation adjustment, higher regulatory and compliance costs, and higher repositioning charges partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings.","On Slide 15 we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. On a trailing twelve-month basis, the efficiency ratio declined to 59% this quarter despite continued elevated legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio for the last twelve months was 28%, down from 29% last quarter.","Slide 16 shows the results for Corp. Other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CECCAR process. Assets of $332 billion included approximately $97 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $180 billion of liquid investment securities.","Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $103 billion at quarter-end with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $8 billion during the quarter driven by net pay downs and divestitures including the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain. ","On Slide 18 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.6 billion were up year-over-year, primarily driven on gains on the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain and lower funding costs, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt used to fund Holdings assets.","Citi Holdings expenses decreased significantly, driven by the lower level of assets as well as lower legal and related costs partially offset by $59 million of episodic expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain. Net Credit losses continued to improve, down 45% year-over-year, driven by North America mortgages. ","And we offset all of the mortgage net Credit losses with loan loss reserve releases. The net loan loss reserve release of $144 million includes the impact of roughly $75million of losses on assets moved to held for sale this quarter. Excluding these losses, the reserve release would have been close to $220 million.","On Slide 19 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 291 basis points in Q3 reflecting lower cost of funds. Looking to Q4, given the sale of Consumer loans with attractive margins in Greece and Spain we could see our net interest margin decline by a basis point or two.","On Slide 20 we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our Basil-3 Tier One common ratio grew to 10.7%, driven by net earnings and continued DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 6.0%, with about half of the sequential increase due to the impact of the revised final US Rules. And our tangible book value grew to $57.73 per share.","In summary, our results in Q3 demonstrated momentum across the firm. In Consumer Banking we grew revenues, loans and deposits in every region resulting in positive operating leverage and strong income growth over last year. And in our Institutional franchise we saw broad revenue growth across Markets, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions, also resulting in positive operating leverage and significant growth in net income.","In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter while continuing to wind down the remaining assets in an economically rational manner. And we continued to grow our book and regulatory capital. ","Looking to Q4, in Consumer Banking we expect to continue growing our revenues while maintaining positive operating leverage year-over-year. In Markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment as well as normal seasonal trends. In Investment Banking, revenues should also reflect the overall market but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance. And in Treasury and Trade Solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues year-over-year in Q4 driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds.","Turning to expenses, in Citicorp our core operating expenses should be relatively flat to Q3 levels as we expect to continue to face ongoing higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process. Repositioning expenses should be more or less in line with the roughly $400 million we incurred in Q3, and legal costs will likely remain elevated and episodic in nature.","We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our Credit performance. And finally, we expect our tax rate for Q4 to be broadly in line with the first half of the year in the range of 32%.","With that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","","Operator","(Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hey, good morning guys. I appreciate the sort of disclosure on Mexico \u2013 obviously that\u2019s been a focus of investors. Obviously you\u2019ve probably done a very thorough review. Can you give us a sense of how you feel about just overall risks \u2013 people talk about AML issues or worries about that? As you\u2019ve gone through the process can you give us some comfort level there? And then I guess taking a step back, second question being as you reduce complexity by getting out of eleven more markets, potentially getting rid of One Main, how do you feel that helps you going into CECCAR next year? Thanks.","Mike Corbat","Sure. Jim, I think from a Mexico perspective we said as part of OSA we were going to embark on a comprehensive review of our policies and processes. That review is significantly underway; I think we\u2019ve made some meaningful changes to the way we come to work and think about things in Mexico. ","We continue to be focused on those things and again are committed to getting the franchise to the right place. It\u2019s an important franchise for us in every sense of the word and a place where we think there\u2019s growth and a place where we need to and should be making investment; and we\u2019ve got to get those things right, and we\u2019re committed to do that. And we\u2019ve put a lot of resources forward both locally and from around the globe to help us be able to do that as quickly as we can.","I think from a complexity perspective, I think two things \u2013 one is you hit on part of it, and John and I talked about it: these eleven Consumer markets plus the Korean piece were those that were in the optimized bucket. They were those that we were working with the businesses on in terms of trying to create a pathway to proper returns. We didn\u2019t in the end see that in these, and so I think in many ways these decisions were made around a couple axis. ","One is that we didn\u2019t see the prospect to getting to adequate returns in a reasonable period of time. Second, we felt that we could take those resources and we could reallocate them into other parts of our business where we would certainly have the ability to try and get more out of them. And I think the third piece you touch on is around those: if you don\u2019t have a pathway to that it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep complexity or keep things in the firm that aren\u2019t going to be able to touch those. So I think we were able to tick off several boxes by making these moves.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Right, makes sense. And I think with these sales though it seems like it helps profitability. Does that give you more comfort on the ROA target? And then just a quick clarification, your ROA target of 90 basis points includes Citi Holdings and that contemplates, I\u2019ve had some questions around the selling of One Main and what that may do to your targets.","John Gerspach","That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Yes, and so the ROA target includes Citi Holdings so that\u2019ll be there to begin. We\u2019ve put all the caveats around big gains or losses that are outsized, etc., but that\u2019s there. And again, I think you can see in these moves \u2013 and again, as we\u2019ve described we\u2019re going to move these businesses into Citi Holdings; and in Citi Holdings I think we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve got the people and the expertise that can manage these exits well. And we don\u2019t want our go forward businesses distracted in that process, and again, we\u2019ve already started the process against most of those and have an expectation that we\u2019d like to be out of the majority of those by the end of \u201915.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","But otherwise you still feel comfortable with the target even if you sell a profitable business like One Main?","John Gerspach","We do, yes we do.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay great, appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. ","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Thanks. Following up on the targets, John and Mike, I was wondering how you\u2019re feeling on the Consumer Bank, on the GCB targets for efficiency ratio on Slide 12. John talked about the target and you give the helpful box there. The 49% to 52% efficiency target seems like a stretch from the pro forma 55%. Can you help us feel better about kind of what are some of the drivers there?","Mike Corbat","Sure, John. When you take a look at that slide I think you\u2019ll notice that at the top of the slide there\u2019s a blue box that has the repositioning charges and legal charges of $800 million, and that both the 56% and the 55% figures include what we would think of as being rather outsized repositioning and legal charges on a trailing twelve-month basis. ","So that, I think you\u2019ve got two things. One is, as you can see with the dark blue boxes both on this slide as well as the next slide, we are continuing to drive down the core operating expenses in the business. But at the same time then I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see the same level of repositioning charges going into 2015 that we\u2019ve seen during 2014.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And John, did you mention that there will be any repositioning charges for the simplification you described today? Or is that a driver for the $400 million that you talked about for Q4?","John Gerspach","I\u2019m sorry, John, I missed the beginning part of your question.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","I was just wondering what repositioning expenses might be associated with the strategic actions you announced today.","John Gerspach","Nothing specific in that $400 million related to the eleven markets. Those things, whether or not we have repositioning charges associate with that will really be determined based upon the structure of whatever deal that we negotiate on a sale. So it\u2019s a little early to call that.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Okay. And then just to clarify the CECCAR expenses, you mentioned incremental costs of $100 million to $150 million in 2014 over 2013?","John Gerspach","Correct. John, $150 million to $175 million is the number that I quoted.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, and you spent $60 million or so this quarter?","John Gerspach","We spent an incremental $60 million year-over-year this quarter.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","And was there any in the first half of the year that would count towards that $150 million?","John Gerspach","Yeah, there was some. Certainly beginning in Q2, I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me but it would have been much less than the $60 million that we had in Q3. And we expect those expenses then to continue to ramp up into Q4.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Got it, okay, so we can kind of put the pieces together there. And then you said one-third of it you expect to be nonrecurring?","John Gerspach","Correct.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Okay. Okay, and then just on Credit, John, you had the reserve release in International Consumer. What drove that and how are you feeling about reserve releases continuing in the other parts of the businesses, domestically in Citicorp and then also in Holdings?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still seeing, well first as far as from an international point of view that was largely driven by Asia but also by continuing favorable credit trends throughout the countries with the exception of where I called out the NCL rate issue that we have in Mexico \u2013 although again, the dollar losses there of net credit losses were largely in line with our expectations. It\u2019s much more of a rate issue.","We continue to see real favorable credit in North America, certainly in both our mortgage business but importantly in both of our cards businesses \u2013 Branded Cards as well as Retail Services. So that story is still continuing. When I look at the net credit margin which I think you see it in the supplement \u2013 the net credit margin in our Branded Cards business this quarter was over 950 basis points. So that\u2019s really outstanding performance in that US Branded Cards business.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","How should we think about whether we\u2019re likely to see some reserve releases in Card or in the mortgage part of Holdings going forward?","John Gerspach","Well the mortgages, as far as from a holdings point of view, John, you can pretty much expect that we\u2019re going to be you know largely netting off reserve releases against the NCLs that come out of mortgages. You know, this quarter it was just about 100%, I think it was like 101%. Last quarter we were in the 90% range, so you\u2019re going to see a large portion of whatever losses we take in the mortgage book in Holdings offset by reserve releases.","As far as the rest of the world I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much more in the way of reserve releases coming out of our International Consumer operations. We continue to grow those books and so just as you continue to grow the loan book you\u2019re going to have to build loan loss reserves against that. And then in the US it\u2019s really going to be driven by just how much better our credit performance can get in our two Cards businesses. You might still see some reserve releases in the near quarters but I wouldn\u2019t look out much past that.","John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Thank you. Maybe just a little color on timing and what drove the one-time implementation of the FVA on the over-the-counter derivatives that you mentioned \u2013 I think you have the bullet on Slide 3.","John Gerspach","Yeah, this is something that we\u2019ve been looking at for some time. There\u2019s been a couple of other institutions that have adopted it so it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been knocking around in the market. We\u2019d set ourselves a goal to adopt it sometime during 2014, as soon as we could get all the systems in place and we had the ability to monitor this type of calculation over several months, a full quarter. And so we had gotten everything in place and we felt comfortable then pulling the trigger on the formal adoption in Q3 instead of waiting until Q4. We think it\u2019s the way the industry is going and therefore we wanted to adopt it as soon as we felt comfortable that we had the systems in place to track it.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, and is the one-time [catch-up], and like you said \u2013 some people have adopted it, some haven\u2019t. And you expect everybody through by year-end?","John Gerspach","I don\u2019t know by year-end but I do think that over time, and I don\u2019t know whether time is this year-end or next year-end, I think the move is to go that way. And we just felt it was better to be at least in the middle of the pack.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Got it, okay. We can move on, thanks.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","You\u2019ve had a big benefit as others have as lower average rate on long-term debt, and that\u2019s been a driver of your stable and actually even growing margin. So I heard your comments about the one or two basis points, I\u2019m not overly focused on that, but my one question is going forward in terms of debt coming due and all thoughts around TLAC how much more optimization do you see coming in say the next two years on the cost of financing, impact on margin and then where you fit in TLAC in general?","John Gerspach","Okay, that\u2019s a very broad question. That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s alright, it\u2019s a great question but let me just try to break it down into pieces. So let me start I guess with TLAC is probably, because again we still don\u2019t know where TLAC is going to come out. We\u2019ve all seen the rumors and everything else but we haven\u2019t seen the formal rules yet so it\u2019s a little hard to judge exactly what\u2019s going to be implemented with TLAC. But from a TLAC point of view right now, we would put our loss absorbent capital at just over 20% of our risk-weighted assets. ","Now that\u2019s again our calculation based upon our interpretation of the rules, and in order to get to that 20% for instance we have eliminated all of the structured notes we issue as saying we think that they\u2019ll be ultimately kept out of the rule. That may be right, that may be wrong but that\u2019s what gets us to that little bit over 20%. So we feel like we\u2019re okay with TLAC, but obviously there\u2019ll be more work to do and we\u2019ll have to see again how the rules come out. So let\u2019s put the response to TLAC aside just for a second.","And then when you take a look at our existing book, you know, I still think that there is some optimization work that we can do on the liability side of our balance sheet. Don\u2019t forget we still have debt that we\u2019re carrying that was issued in \u201907, \u201908, \u201909, \u201910 when our credit spreads were much higher than they are today. And so as that debt runs off that can still give you some lift.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Maybe the other side of the equation is I\u2019ve noticed growth in international markets has been good on the loan side. The deposit growth has been less impressive and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re doing consciously or just a product of some of the markets that you\u2019re in. Just curious on\u2026","John Gerspach","Glenn, what you\u2019re seeing is we are active managers of our balance sheet and again, you\u2019ll notice that. Especially take a look at the US Cards business \u2013 I mentioned that before. You\u2019ll see there that we\u2019ve actually been driving up yields in the US Cards business. As we\u2019ve let those promotional balances run off we\u2019ve actually experienced higher yields than on those interest-earning assets. So I don\u2019t want you to think that everything we\u2019re doing is just on the right-hand side of the balance sheet; we\u2019re actively moving on the left-hand side of the balance sheet as well as we think about driving our NIM performance.","But to your other question then on deposits, yes, we\u2019re active managers of our deposit base as well. And we\u2019re looking to run what we would term a \u2018compact\u2019 balance sheet. We\u2019re not looking to grow the balance sheet much beyond where it is today. We don\u2019t think we need a balance sheet much larger than $1.9 trillion to serve our clients. And so within that construct then you need to be very careful about both what you put on the left side of the balance sheet and how you fund that on the right side of the balance sheet.","And so when you deal with all the rules that are out there as far as net stable funding ratio, the LCR, the SLR \u2013 all of those rules come into play as we think about how to structure the right side of the balance sheet.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, maybe just a really quick wrap-up. We definitely appreciate Slide 8 on the impact of the strategic actions. Are we looking at that slide each quarter as we roll through \u201915 or is there chance you move those eleven markets in something like discontinued ops and we get a clean look at Citicorp without it?","John Gerspach","No, Glenn, one of the things that we mentioned is that effective Q1 we\u2019ll move those eleven markets into Holdings so that we will give you a clean look at the GCB. We\u2019ll show it on a pro forma basis again next quarter but then beginning in Q1 we\u2019ll give you a clean look at the Global Consumer Bank.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Thank you, missed that one. Appreciate it.","John Gerspach","That\u2019s not a problem, sir.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Hi, good afternoon. So first one, just a quick one, I don\u2019t know whether you can comment \u2013 JP Morgan gave us a little bit on the source of it. The legal charge, is it possible to say what that\u2019s tied to? I think JP Morgan indicated it was heavily tied to FX.","Mike Corbat","Yeah, Brennan, as you know we typically don\u2019t comment on reserving actions unless it\u2019s related to a specific settlement that we\u2019re announcing. So that\u2019s as far as we\u2019re going to go today.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Okay. And then on the funding side, I believe you had said that funding costs drove the NIM expansion. Can maybe you give a bit more color on specifically what was behind that?","Mike Corbat","Again, as we manage both the cost of our deposits as well as the cost of our debt, we\u2019ve managed to improve the cost of funds. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s giving you enough or if you need something, but the improvement was just about evenly split between the two. And so that\u2019s actively managing deposits \u2013 we\u2019re managing down things like time deposits and instead concentrating on getting deposit growth in operating balances, which are either interest-free or interest-light. And then on the long-term debt, again we\u2019re swapping out debt where we had issued it under higher credit spreads and replacing it with debt that is a bit more attractive to us today.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Yeah, sorry, I meant is there any geography impact there or anything beyond just shifting away from time deposits?","Mike Corbat","Well, from a geography point of view most of the debt would be US-centric and the deposits would be a global phenomenon.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Okay. And then thinking about your rate shock scenario, can you give any color about how that might look in Year 2 or how you might think about that in Year 2? Just trying to think about the benefit from rolling the portfolio into higher-yielding securities versus your expectation for deposit pricing pressure.","John Gerspach","Yeah, when we put out the $1.9 billion impact that really is, it\u2019s a rate shock type of thing. So it\u2019s an estimate as to what the revenue impact would be to the firm over a year if rates just moved instantaneously by 100 basis points. Now, obviously then as you begin to operate in that environment there\u2019d be a lot of moving pieces and give and take, but I would say that for the most part that $1.9 billion should be sustaining into Year 2. You might have some changes a little bit around the edges but it should be largely sustaining.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Okay, and I guess so effectively the benefit from rolling into higher rates would probably be largely offset by increasing deposit pricing?","John Gerspach","Yeah, if you\u2019re in a rising rate environment again it\u2019s going to certainly impact both sides of your balance sheet. That\u2019s why I say it would be largely sustaining.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Okay, terrific. And then the last one with me, is it possible to get a rough idea of the cost basis of One Main?","John Gerspach","No.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS ","Alright, figured I\u2019d give it a shot. Thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","That\u2019s okay, Brennan, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Hi gentlemen. So you announced what sounded like very logical moves on the Global Consumer side. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the capital free-up potential \u2013 what\u2019s either your capital allocated to those markets or the RWA impact?","John Gerspach","Not at this point in time, Guy. We\u2019ve given you the capital attribution for the overall Consumer business and we\u2019ll refresh that in Q1, and when we refresh that in Q1 you\u2019ll see the impact from those exits as well as other changes.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Okay, fair enough. When you think about what you\u2019ve been doing to try to get a more positive CECCAR outcome next time I was wondering if you have had some discussions with the regulators about how they would view this type of strategic action that you\u2019re taking?","Mike Corbat","Sure, Guy, it\u2019s Mike. Obviously we\u2019re in pretty constant and consistent dialog with the regulators. I think in there the business model and the running of the business is our decision in terms of what we want to do, and provided that we can show we\u2019ve got the ability to run it in the right way they\u2019re fine with that. I think to the earlier question, in this case given that these aren\u2019t and in the immediate case we don\u2019t see a path to being accretive for our shareholders it\u2019ll certainly work towards a smaller, simpler Consumer business, a more focused Consumer business. And in the end I think taking those factors, you\u2019ve got to view that as a positive. But the regulators haven\u2019t commented specifically on it. ","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Got it. Just a question on the DTA utilization: the level you did in the quarter was kind of comparable to what you did last year on a quarterly basis but I think in the first half you had been running more around $1.1 billion. I was just wondering mechanically maybe you can explain to us why it fell off.","John Gerspach","Yeah, really it has to do, Guy, with everything. Earnings has been fairly consistent, so if you look at the earnings impact over the last couple quarters, our earnings \u2013 both coming out of Citicorp as well as Citi Holdings \u2013 have been running at about $800 million a quarter; I think one quarter it hit $900 million. So the real change from what we were running in the first half to what we ran in the second really has to do with the impact of CVA and OCI and it\u2019s as simple as that.","But the earnings potential, if you go into the back of the deck, Page 39, there you\u2019ll see that for a trailing twelve-month period the earnings of Corp and Holdings utilized $3.4 billion of DTA. Now on a year-to-date basis that similar number is $2.6 billion and in the quarter it was $800 million. So again, very consistent at $800 million, $900 million a quarter, the earnings power of the franchise begins to utilize the DTA. It\u2019s the other stuff \u2013 it\u2019s how the OCI moves that gives you a little bit of noise that you see over there on the right side. For a full year the impact of all of that was $200 million of utilization but you\u2019re going to get noise quarter to quarter.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Got it. So the noise is going to depend on what happens to your credit spreads and those of your counterparties, and OCI \u2013 in other words, rates. And so you\u2019re really not going to know about that until the end of the quarter, basically.","John Gerspach","That\u2019s exactly right, Guy. And again, that\u2019s going to be some noise but I think that the number you really want to focus on is how are we doing as far as utilizing DTA driven by the earnings capacity of the franchise.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Yeah, understood. Absolutely. JPM called out emerging markets\u2019 revenue in [FIC] as a driver of the relative strength in the quarter and I was kind of surprised that you didn\u2019t, that you indicated securitized products more just given your mix. Can you give us a sense for emerging markets\u2019 results in [FIC] in the quarter versus the two reference quarters?","John Gerspach","Yeah, our emerging markets franchises performed very well in the quarter. They didn\u2019t necessarily contribute as much to growth year-over-year because they actually had a pretty good performance in Q3 last year. Now, the FX franchise performed well globally driven by September but if you\u2019re just trying to isolate what changed year-over-year securitized products had a slightly larger contribution. ","And if you think about the environment that we were living in in Q3 last year compared to Q3 this year I think it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out why there would have been a little bit more client activity around securitized products \u2013 it was just a little bit better. Even though it wasn\u2019t a great rate environment it was certainly a better US rate environment than what we had last year.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Yeah, makes sense. Final one from me: during the quarter at least some of the, I guess Dodd-Frank driven new daily filings on liquidity and I think some of the Volcker stuff started to go into effect for the GFEBS. And I was just wondering to what extent you might ascribe some of what we were hearing towards the end of the quarter, [which] was some liquidity issues in credit markets \u2013 does that have anything to do with it?","John Gerspach","You know, I don\u2019t know if I would ascribe movements in the credit markets, certainly not to Volcker. But I think everyone is looking to see how they\u2019re going to manage in a SLR\/LCR\/NSFR type of world. And anytime that you put out brand new rules I think it takes a while then for the system to sort of adapt to them. And that may have been some of the noise that you heard about at the end of the quarter.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","But do you think it has or maybe had temporarily an impact on the inventory management for the big dealers?","John Gerspach","I would say that anybody who\u2019s concerned about managing their balance sheet, yeah, it would definitely have an impact. You have to be highly cognizant now of your SLR ratio and you\u2019ve got to manage through both the SLR and the LCR. So depending upon what deposits you take in, those deposits could have a high liquidity value or they could have zero liquidity value. If a deposit has zero liquidity value then you can\u2019t do anything with it other than invest it overnight, which means you\u2019re holding either cash or overnight Treasury securities. Now that drives up the asset side of your balance sheet and now you\u2019ve got to be worried about your SLR constraints because all of a sudden now you\u2019ve got to put capital against that.","So depending upon where any individual firm was at quarter-end I would say that they were definitely watching both the asset side of the balance sheet from an SLR point of view and the right side of the balance sheet from a combined LCR and SLR point of view.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research ","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And thanks for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem at all, Guy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","If I could follow up on your comment about a strong CECCAR submission, if you can elaborate on that \u2013 on what does \u2018strong\u2019 mean do you think from a process point of view, from a capital [deployment ask] or just any comments you can give around that since you did mention it?","Mike Corbat","Yeah, I think as I described, Matt, really we\u2019ve been focused on a number of things. But one is that really taking the CECCAR process and really embedding it into the firm and again, I think that goes along a few different channels. One is management engagement \u2013 how is management thinking about the business? What are the risks in their business? How do we quantify those? How do we position the firm against those? ","Second is I think work we\u2019ve done around our models \u2013 building model validation, model integration into the firm. I think that we\u2019ve worked hard in terms of making sure in essence we\u2019ve got the boots on the ground across the different areas, in particular second and third lines of defense and making sure that they\u2019re synched up against our businesses and really operating in the right way. So it\u2019s a big focus towards model build-out, that infrastructure, but most importantly how really that gets embedded in the way we think about and run the business on a day-to-day basis \u2013 not a one-off submission and then back to the old ways.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And I realize it\u2019s still about five, six months away in order to get all the guidelines, but as you think about what a successful outcome would be is passing on a qualitative basis enough or would you want to also be able to have a meaningful amount of buybacks as well to view it as a success?","Mike Corbat","Well I think as you alerted to we\u2019re not going to speak to what the number is but we\u2019ve got to certainly get beyond success being measured as a successful submission with no capital ask, right? We\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re fortunate to generate large amounts of regulatory capital and we\u2019ve got to put the firm in a position to return that. So I would view a successful ask as a combination of those things.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately on expenses, the Q4 commentary of relatively flat on a core basis is helpful. As we think into next year maybe before we account for some of the business exits, but how should we think about the expense run rate beyond this year? You\u2019ve been taking some of these repositioning costs that I know have been driving the positive operating leverage. Is there more benefit from those still to come?","John Gerspach","Matt, at this point in time we\u2019re still focused on in 2015 on delivering being able to run Citicorp in the mid-50%s efficiency ratio. So that\u2019s the target that we set out for ourselves a year and a half ago and that\u2019s still the target that we\u2019re working at towards 2015.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","Hi. As far as the GCB restructuring, Mike, is this it \u2013 going from 35 markets to 24? Or is there potentially more?","Mike Corbat","Well I think as you look, Mike, just to kind of put it in context \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone from a number higher than that. I think in aggregate we\u2019re down somewhere around 15, 17 markets in the past couple years. And so what we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ve got an ongoing process which we\u2019ve talked very openly about, about our country bucketing and our business bucketing and the way we think about those. ","We do still have businesses in the optimized bucket \u2013 those businesses obviously not being on the list are making progress towards the goals that we\u2019ve agreed to in terms of where they\u2019re going to get those businesses. And again, those buckets will continue as they\u2019ve been to be fluid and we\u2019ll keep assessing things against what we\u2019ve laid out. But right now those businesses are on track and feel like they\u2019ve got a pathway to get to a place of having adequate returns or good returns in the consumer business.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","Is there more restructuring in the US that you can do? You mentioned mortgage and branches \u2013 what else could be done?","Mike Corbat","Well, as we\u2019ve laid out a series of metrics from a headcount, a product perspective, from a site perspective \u2013 things that are probably the largest drivers of costs in there, it\u2019s on Page 13 in the deck. And so we\u2019re committed on delivering those. We\u2019ve made significant progress against those: continuing to simplify our products, continuing to rationalize our branch footprint, continuing to shrink and consolidate our support sites. And again, those are the big drivers of expenses. So as we\u2019ve laid out there we\u2019ve got more work we think we can do.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","So getting to that target range in GCB of 49% to 52%, that would be more than simply less legal and repositioning costs? John, I think your answer earlier said that that was going to be a nice driver of it, but other than that what would be the main drivers?","John Gerspach"," No Mike, as I said before there\u2019s two elements to it. I drew your attention, at least I intended to draw the attention to that Chart 12 and note that there were two areas of the expenses. We had the light blue box at the top which talked about the legal and repositioning charges and I pointed to that as one area that we felt would contribute next year. But more importantly, and I think this is where you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s the big blue box at the bottom that really talks about those core operating expenses. And there we intend to continue to drive those core operating expenses down.","We lay out for you on Slide 12 the progress that we\u2019ve made on a trailing twelve-month basis but then you can also see when you flip over to Slide 13 that we\u2019re making progress in that area on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that is going to continue as we continue to execute on the actions that Mike talked about \u2013 as we continue to reduce headcount, we continue to simplify the product offering and we continue to rationalize our branch and support site structures. So all of that work continues; it\u2019s ongoing now. It will remain ongoing into next year and beyond.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","Okay, and last follow-up on that: when you say \u2018support sites\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to get a little more meat on the bones on this Slide 13. Is support sites going down, is that a big expense takeout; or the headcount reduction, the branches, that should all help. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of magnitude.","Mike Corbat","So support sites, Mike, I\u2019d break into probably two big buckets. One would be service centers and the second would be datacenters, and obviously as you can consolidate those, turn space back, create more scale, etc., you\u2019ve got the ability to get those costs out \u2013 centers of excellence, however you choose to describe them. And so I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to do that and we\u2019ve got more work to do.","John Gerspach","Yeah, Mike, I think when you look at those four items that we lay out there they all are somewhat interrelated. We don\u2019t have \u201cstandardize the platform\u201d there but clearly as you simplify your products and you put everything onto one standard platform that means that you can then collapse a lot of individual call centers into one because you\u2019re not running individual call centers for different products in every country \u2013 each one then having to deal with a different operating system.","So we standardize the information available to our customer service personnel. We make it easier for them to understand the products that we offer. That then enables them to provide a much better experience to our clients. So we can simplify the products, we standardized the platforms; we can reduce the sites and therefore we can actually provide our clients with a better experience with less people.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Just one other separate question: I opened up the paper this morning and saw some comments from Mike O\u2019Neil, the Chairman. And so Mike Corbat, what\u2019s your current relationship with Mike O\u2019Neil, and just I thought the timing was interesting to see the Chairman. And Citigroup\u2019s the last major US bank that has the CEO and Chairman position split so I\u2019m just wondering your current thoughts on that \u2013 the tradeoff, the benefits, the costs of having that.","Mike Corbat","Sure. I think from our perspective, I won\u2019t speak to others\u2019 \u2013 I think our relationship and our structure works well for us. I think our relationship is excellent. I think the dialog with the Board is very good and I think from a governance perspective and a relationship perspective when we think about and run the firm and the delineation of duties, it certainly works for us.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","And the degree that Mike O\u2019Neil\u2019s giving you council when it comes to these restructuring moves, like the one you announced today?","Mike Corbat","I think we always have good, engaged strategic interaction with the Board \u2013 not just Mike but with the Board. And so the Board was aware of these actions and supportive of the actions that management recommended.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA ","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning \u2013 just a quick, ticky-tacky question at this stage. You mentioned the core operating expenses at $10.9 billion looking to keep relatively flat into Q4. I know we have some CECCAR expenses coming up a little bit. I mean maybe that adds a percent or something like that but we should expect those CECCAR expenses are on top of what you did in Q3, would it be incremental? Or are you saying that you think you have other things in core operating expenses you\u2019re going to peel back and that\u2019s going to offset your CECCAR expense increase in the quarter?","John Gerspach","We would say that again, we should be able to keep the expenses relatively flat into Q4. We still have benefits that are rolling off for other expense initiatives that we\u2019ve introduced. I mean you\u2019ve seen the amount of repositioning charges that we\u2019ve taken \u2013 those repositioning charges do generate real savings. But those savings in Q4 are likely going to be reinvested then as we continue to enhance our capital planning process, CECCAR.","Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, I get it. Thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ","Thank you, good afternoon. Can you share with us, in your last (q) I think you put in there that a 100-basis point shift in the yield curve would contribute an additional $1.9 billion or so to revenue. If the yield curve flattens and The Fed does move rates up next year, but as you notice the ten-year today is down to about 2.2% - if we don\u2019t get the parallel shift how much of the benefit would you likely see with the front end going up but the long end remaining anchored where it is today?","John Gerspach","If the front end went up but the long end dropped, there is a scenario we\u2019ve laid out for you which has a 100 basis point increase in short-term and a relatively flat long-term. I think what you see in that type of environment, we capture the lion\u2019s share of the $1.9 billion. I don\u2019t have that number in my head but it\u2019s a substantial portion of the $1.9 billion.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ","Great. The second question is can you remind us, in terms of your capital ratios, your Tier One Common ratio for example, what kind of cushion do you want to keep above whatever the final number turns out to be? And I know that\u2019s a moving target because you\u2019re seeing The Fed and others ask for more capital and they haven\u2019t given us the exact numbers yet, but are you looking to maintain a 50- or 100-basispoint number over whatever the final target becomes?","John Gerspach","Well, as you say it\u2019s a little hard right now because we don\u2019t know where the final rules are going to come out. So give us a chance to take a look at the final rule and then we\u2019ll be happy to tell you what kind of buffer we think we need. There\u2019s still a bit of rulemaking yet to be laid down. We\u2019ve got the promise of another G-SIFI surcharge. We\u2019ve got OLA that still needs to be finalized. So when these things begin to settle down we\u2019ll be happy to come back to you then with a more informed target.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ","Okay, thank you. And then as of today what would you point to as your binding constraint on the capital ratios? Which one do you guys look to today? And again, I know that this may not be the case a year from now.","John Gerspach","Well let\u2019s see \u2013 on October 14th I\u2019d say it\u2019s Tier One, Basil-3, Advanced Approach, Tier One Common. But check back with me by November 14th and I may have a slightly different answer. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute \u2013 it\u2019s just that as the rules begin to change and they intersect you\u2019re constantly battling one against the other. If you had asked me a year ago I would have said SLR was going to be the binding constraint. Six months ago I was really worried that Standardized RWA, the standardized approach was going to be the binding constraint. Today I feel like it\u2019s Basil-3 Tier One Common, and then of course there\u2019s always the ultimate is of course the CECCAR submission itself. So we need to keep our eye on all four of those and it doesn\u2019t do you any good to just manage one.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ","Great. And then one last question: the Shared National Credit Exam hasn\u2019t been released yet, probably will be shortly here, but there was some commentary by The Federal Reserve. They\u2019re still concerned about leveraged loans by some of the larger banks \u2013 they\u2019re aggressively underwriting them \u2013 and they now claim they may use this in CECCAR as part of the qualitative area. Do you guys have any color on that or what do you guys think about that? Are you concerned about that if they bring it into the CECCAR process the way everybody underwrites leveraged lending?","Mike Corbat","You know, those rumors are there, Gerard. We haven\u2019t heard anything on that formally so obviously this has been a big area of focus for The Fed and the OCC, so evolving. But we haven\u2019t gotten any guidance on that so far.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets ","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities ","Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping you could provide some clarity on what drove the sequential increase in risk-weighted assets. I guess historically what we\u2019ve seen particularly given periods of elevated FX volatility that there\u2019s a natural capital hedge from FX translation on the RWA denominator. And I didn\u2019t know if you could provide some more detailed guidance as to what were the sources of RWA build in the quarter.","John Gerspach","Yeah, that\u2019s a good question, Steven. Since the beginning of the year we\u2019ve absorbed about, well, you can see it on the chart back on Slide 20 \u2013 we\u2019ve got about $60 billion in incremental RWA since the beginning of the year. The impact of business growth in Citicorp has been more than offset by reductions in Holdings and we\u2019ve gotten a little bit of FX benefit in this quarter that was probably worth about $10 billion or so. But the entire net impact really is the result of enhancements to our risk models, primarily credit models, and as well as our interpretation of the final B-3 rules. So we\u2019ve been enhancing our models and that\u2019s caused us then to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets that are required.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities ","Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. Is that model enhancement process, is it largely completed at this juncture or should we expect that there\u2019s more to come which could result in some RWA stickiness going forward?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I\u2019d say we think that now we\u2019ve done an intensive review of the models certainly, especially in the period since we\u2019ve gone live on the Basil-3 advanced approach. And we\u2019re certainly comfortable with the models as they exist right now but here comes the big \u201chowever.\u201d However, our regulators still continue their reviews so there still may be additional enhancements required going forward.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities ","Alright, fair enough. And just one more from me relating to the Securities portfolio and specifically the breakdown of HTM versus AFS. The last two quarters we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of securities you\u2019ve classified as hold to maturity, and just looking at last year\u2019s CECCAR results and in addition to that your midyear stress test exam which was published for public consumption, the AOCI losses were actually quite substantial and presumably should only increase as the number of Basil-3 deductions are recognized within the transitional horizon. I was wondering whether CECCAR considerations have actually prompted you to accelerate the reclassification of some of your securities portfolio and is that something that we should expect to persist going forward?","John Gerspach","I\u2019d say if you looked at the percentage of our investment portfolio that is classified as HTM we\u2019re probably underweight compared to many of our peers. And so as we look at the possibility of reclassifying things between AFS and HTM it\u2019s a little bit more being driven by our view as far as volatility in our OCI, and therefore how that impacts the numerator in our regulatory capital. So again, that\u2019s really our focus. We want to make sure we\u2019ve got the right mix and again, we don\u2019t want to overweight towards hold to maturity. But we would look at it right now and say perhaps we\u2019re a little underweight where we are.","Having said that we\u2019re very comfortable with the level that we have right now so I\u2019m not leading you to the fact that we\u2019re going to be increasing it dramatically. But we may continue to add bits and pieces into the HTM.","Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities ","Alright, understood. Thanks for clarifying that, John, and thank you for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem, Steven.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America ","Yes, my questions have been asked and answered, thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay, thank you Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company ","Thanks, guys. Just one question for me: John, you alluded in your prepared remarks to the recent bit of slowing in some of the international businesses. And I just wondered if you could flesh out for us when you think about your international businesses and developed versus emerging markets, do you see that slowdown as either A) partly seasonal, B) any change in terms of how you\u2019re perceiving growth; or C) related to just this kind of downgrade of growth expectations \u2013 and how are you responding to that?","John Gerspach","I would say it\u2019s more of the latter as far as just the overall impact of everyone\u2019s expectations for global growth coming down a bit. In the comments that I made earlier I think what you\u2019re referring to is some of the comments I made as far as loan growth that we had in Latin America, specifically Mexico. So you do have certain market-by-market where you can see the impact, but from an emerging market view we still see good growth, good overall growth coming out of the emerging markets especially when compared to the developed markets. It\u2019s just a little bit less growth than what we would have anticipated earlier in the year.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company ","And just as a quick follow-up on that: have you noticed anything then, you\u2019d mentioned a couple of comments in your prepared comments in the deck about spreads but has the spread and competitive environment changed at all in that too? Or are you finding yourself still able to gain share within those faster-growing economies?","John Gerspach","Yeah, we\u2019re doing fine and I think that we\u2019re managing to keep pace within the economies in which we operate. We have seen spread pressure hit us in the trade product \u2013 that\u2019s certainly something that hit us this quarter. When you take a look at the revenue growth in TTS, the revenue growth in TTS was impacted both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter by a roughly $40 million decline in Trade product revenues. And while the spreads in the cash management business were largely stable overall trade spreads have been declining now for several quarters. ","So we\u2019ve seen that impact but we are maintaining our market share in that product, but we\u2019re doing that by shifting to an originate for sale type of approach. So we\u2019re maintaining market share but instead of originating for balance sheet we\u2019re originating to sell \u2013 that means that we forego net interest revenue in return for an upfront fee but as a result the trade revenue assets have declined, so have our trade assets. But we\u2019ve preserved and in some cases have improved our returns. So there\u2019s different ways of managing through lower spread environments.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company ","Very well, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. ","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi John, thanks for taking my question. Just first of all, and I don\u2019t want to make too much of the midyear DFAST numbers but I was curious \u2013 your PPNR estimate for the most recent midyear DFAST was down about a little less than 30%. In fact that was in line with most of the other big banks but I guess I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any color you can provide as to what the difference was between the numbers that you put together for this year\u2019s midyear cycle and last year\u2019s midyear cycle just in terms of the PPNR exchange? ","John Gerspach","Well, I think there\u2019s two things. One is there\u2019s a different scenario. Obviously each year you construct a different scenario in which you then assess your stress within that scenario. So there\u2019s a scenario difference and also as Mike said earlier we\u2019re in the process of enhancing our overall capital planning process and I think you see some of the results in those numbers.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And just moving on to the mortgage business, I know that\u2019s not a huge contributor to your overall bottom line but I guess in the bigger picture I\u2019m just curious how you all are thinking about the potential for loosening of standards by the FHFA even if it\u2019s minimal loosening in terms of opening up maybe the lower end of the mortgage market; and how much that might affect your ability to generate mortgage revenue given that you tend to target slightly better credit quality customers?","Mike Corbat","I guess I would start in that, Matt, in terms of saying I think that that\u2019s important. I think it\u2019s good for the market because what we\u2019ve seen is the mortgage market today isn\u2019t functioning the way we\u2019d like. If you\u2019re not 20% down and high FICO it\u2019s been quite tough for people to get in and to be able to afford and buy homes. So one is I think for the overall system we would be supportive of that. ","I think as you rightly point out our model is largely focused around our Citi clients which tend to be higher in FICOs and probably have the ability to make higher down payments and higher deposits. But again, some of it falls in there and we\u2019d certainly be open and we\u2019d be supportive of that. So I think from our perspective I don\u2019t think it would have a big impact on Citi but I think it would be very constructive for the market.","Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that\u2019s it for me, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Yeah, hi. I was wondering in the context of the Page 8 disclosure about the impact of the strategic actions is $7 billion in loans roughly; and on Page 31 we see that Korea alone has about $24 billion in consumer loans. So I\u2019m wondering what specifically is in there and what isn\u2019t, and particularly I guess I was wondering is from all those countries is Citi Cards also withdrawing or is it just the basic branch system?","John Gerspach","Yeah, let me try to help you through that one. First is we are not exiting the consumer franchise in Korea. We\u2019re exiting a specific element of that business \u2013 the consumer finance business in Korea which is a much smaller component of the overall Korea franchise. So when you take a look at the $24 billion worth of consumer loans that we have in Korea it\u2019s a relatively small amount of those loans that is actually then coming out.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. And then just the cards \u2013 in those eleven countries are you basically out of the branch system, the branch banking system or also out of the card business as well?","John Gerspach","It\u2019s going to be out of cards as well as out of the branches.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. And then lastly for me I\u2019m not sure if you can comment but on the cover of the One Main S(1) it lists the proposed maximum offering of being $50 million in size. That seemed very small and I was wondering if there\u2019s any color you can provide us on how we should expect the disposition to proceed in the year ahead.","John Gerspach","Sure. I would describe that as a filing and again, I think our stated intent all along in this is to go towards a process that drives this business in terms of best price, best terms to the right buyer. I would say that kind of going in this we\u2019ll run a sale process and if we don\u2019t get a sales process to the right place then we\u2019ll pursue an IPO. But we wanted to have the flexibility to do that and if we got there we didn\u2019t want to have to wait the time necessarily to have to do all the filing. And obviously in preparation for the sale process you do a lot of those things that are requisite in the filing anyway. So it was I think convenient to be able to do that. So again, move towards the sale process and we\u2019ll always have the option to do an IPO if we want to use it.","Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Great, thank you. That\u2019s it for me.","Mike Corbat ","Great, thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [Brian Klein-Hansel] with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. ","[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW ","Yeah, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the strategic actions today. You mentioned that these were coming mostly from the optimized restructure market that you had identified previously, but also on that same chart you\u2019d also identified 20 markets which were the invest to grow markets. And I\u2019m assuming that you take these dollars allocated to the eleven markets and move those to the invest to grow. Kind of what are the top three markets that you\u2019re looking to invest in these days?","John Gerspach","I would say as we look around we\u2019re clearly in no particular order investing in the US in several different ways; we continue to invest, we had a stated investment program that we\u2019re gearing towards Mexico. We\u2019ve talked about other markets in Asia where we\u2019ve been targeted and continuing to grow our businesses. So I think there\u2019s several places. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a shortage of places where we can put these resources so to speak at better levels than they\u2019re being used today.","[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW ","Okay, great. And just one other question on the tax rate guidance that you gave: are you assuming that all the legal charges going forward are now going to be tax deductible and that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting to the lower tax rate there?","John Gerspach","No, no. We anticipate that again it\u2019s going to be dependent upon item by item as far as whether or not we would assess an accrual to be tax deductible or not. But as we look into Q4 right now we think that a 32% more or less tax rate is where we\u2019ll end up.","[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW ","Okay, great.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017 for $1.35 per share. We clearly carried momentum in many of our businesses from the end of last year into the quarter, leading to significantly better performance from one year ago. While our results were impacted by one-time gains, we increased revenues in both our consumer and institutional lines of business, while maintaining our expense discipline. We grew loans and deposits, and achieved an efficiency ratio of just under 58%, a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity, ex-DTA, of over 10%, in line with our near term targets which were committed to meeting.","Global consumer banking, our U.S. credit card business continued to benefit from the Costco portfolio, although we did see lower mortgage revenues. Internationally, we again posted revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Asia and Mexico, and we continued our investment plan in Mexico to drive improved efficiency and returns.","The Institutional Clients Group had a strong quarter all around, as we keep gaining share among our target clients. Our Markets business performed very well with revenue up 17% year-over-year, comprised of 19% increase in fixed income and 10% increase in equities, another area we\u2019ve been investing in. Banking results were also strong; notably, in Investment Banking, which was up almost 40% and Treasury and Trade Solutions and the Private Bank were each up 9%, as well.","We also continued to wind down legacy assets recording gains on asset sales including our consumer finance business in Canada and our consumer business in Argentina. This help to offset the one-time impact from exiting our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. We utilized $800 million in deferred tax assets, contributing to the $5.5 billion of total regulatory capital generation before returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders.","During the past year, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 6% and returned 80% of earnings to our common shareholders. Our tangible book value per share increased to $65.94, that\u2019s 5% higher than a year ago and 14% higher than two years ago. Even still, our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio has increased to 12.8%, well above the 11.5% upper range of what we believe we need to operate the firm prudently. So we clearly have excess capital and couldn\u2019t be more committed to returning that capital to our shareholders. Last week, we made our CCAR submission for the current cycle and feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made to strengthen our firm.","We also continue to be positive about growth in general and the U.S. economy. While the details of potential policy changes in area such as tax code and infrastructure spending have yet to be worked out and will take a little longer than originally projected, we continue to believe that it\u2019s a matter of when and not if these changes will occur. As that process unfolds and outcomes become clear, I expect business will react accordingly as sentiment shifts from optimism to confidence.","In the meantime, we continue to do our part to support growth and communities across the U.S. We were recently named the top Affordable Housing Finance here for the seventh year in a row, and we announced a small business lending increased to $11 billion last year, almost double what it was five years earlier. We remained confident in our model and our unique global network, which processes 4 trillion in payments a day and helps U.S. companies compete overseas. We\u2019ve built a franchise that\u2019s balanced across product and geography, and we're making targeted investments where we see the best opportunities to grow revenue and improve returns.","With that, John will go through our presentation. Then we'll be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide three, we show total Citigroup results. Net income grew 17% to $4.1 billion in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit.","And earnings per share grew 23%, including the benefit of share buybacks, which drove the 6% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding.","Revenues of $18.1 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues and Corporate\/Other, as we continued wind down legacy assets. Expenses were roughly flat as the impact of higher performance related compensation and higher business volumes, was offset by lower repositioning cost.","Ongoing investments were largely funded through efficiency savings. And cost of credit decline significantly, driven by a $230 million reserve release this quarter in ICG, as compared to a build in the prior year related to the energy sector. Consumer cost and credit increased year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio and other volume growth, as well as the continued impact of changes in collection processes in U.S. cards.","As previously announced, our result this quarter included a charge of nearly $400 million related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. This charge was recorded in Corporate\/Other, with roughly $300 million reflected as a reduction in revenues and the remainder in expenses. However, we were able to more than offset this impact with nearly $750 million of gains on other asset sales, including gains of roughly $400 million on the sales of two businesses, Citi Financial Canada and Argentina Consumer, which closed on the last day in the quarter. On a net basis, these episodic items benefited our results by roughly $0.08 per share.","In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $629 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other. And deposits grew 3% to $950 billion.","Turning now to each business, slide four shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the first quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% from last year, driven by lower mortgage revenues. Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $80 million year-over-year, reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights. Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues were up 5%, driven by continued growth in average loans deposits and assets under management.","We're seeing positive early results from the launch of our enhance Citigold wealth management offering in the U.S. with year-to-date growth in households and balances tracking in line with our expectations. At the same time, we continued to transform our network this quarter by reducing our branch count to roughly 700, while continuing to roll out smart branch formats, including Citigold centers, expanding our Citigold sales force and adding new digital capabilities as transaction activity continues to shift to self service digital and mobile channels.","Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.1 billion grew 13%, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition and modest organic growth, offset by the impact of day count. We saw good engagement across the franchise again this quarter, with 4% year-over-year growth in average loans, excluding Costco. Looking at the total portfolio, despite the normal pay down you would expect in the first quarter, our full rate revolving balances remained stable sequentially. And we continued to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans in the second half of the year as our investments mature.","The interest yield on the portfolio was also relatively flat sequentially at roughly 9.6% this quarter, as the recent rate increase was offset by growth in promotional rate balances as well as the impact of portfolio mix. From here, we expect yields to improve, driven by rate increases as well as the growth in full rate revolving balances in the second half of the year.","Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were down 5%, driven mostly by the absence of gains on the sale of two small portfolios in the first quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of divestiture activity, revenues were up 1% year-over-year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 3% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost.","And finally, credit costs of $1.4 billion increased roughly $330 million from last year. Net credit losses increased to $1.2 billion, mostly driven by Costco organic volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of changes in collection processes and cards. And we build roughly $160 million of loan loss reserves during the quarter to support volume growth.","Looking at our card portfolios in more detail, in branded cards, our NCL rates of 3.1% was inflated this quarter by the flow through of delinquencies to credit losses related to the Costco conversion. Excluding this impact, which is now behind us, the branded card NCL rate was closer to 2.9%, up from the prior quarter due mostly to seasonality and the previously mentioned impact on collections.","We believe this collection\u2019s impact is now stabilizing and so the NCL rate should improve in the second half of the year, driven by normal seasonality. This is consistent with the improvement we saw this quarter in both 90-day, 90 plus day and early bucket delinquencies on a dollar basis. Therefore, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in branded cards of around 280 basis points. The drivers are similar for retail services where the loss rate increased from the prior quarter. But given normal seasonal improvement in delinquencies, we continue to expect the full year NCL rate to be around 435 basis points.","On slide five we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 12% from last year on higher revenue and slightly lower operating expenses partially offset by higher cost on credit. In total, revenues grew 3% and expenses were down 1% versus last year. In Latin America, total consumer revenue grew 4%, driven by an 8% growth in retail banking, reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spread. However, card revenue declined from last year, reflecting lower revolving loans, as well as a higher cost to fund non-revolving balances.","Total average card loans grew 5% year-over-year. However, revolving balances have generally lagged as we have grown in high quality consumer segments with lower revolvers. The year-over-year trends are improving, however, and we expect to return to growth in revolving card loans sometime in the second half of the year. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year in Latin America as ongoing investment spending was offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost. We continue to execute our investment plans in Mexico, which we believe will drive improved operating efficiency and returns, over-time. And we still expect to maintain positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in cards and Wealth Management, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Card revenues grew 6%, driven by higher volumes and improved revolve rates versus last year. Average card loans were up 3% and purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting slight organic improvement, as well as the recent acquisition of a $700 million co-brand portfolio with Coles Supermarkets in Australia.","Retail revenues were up slightly year-over-year as higher Wealth Management revenues were largely offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Average retail loans were stable sequentially, but down 5% year-over-year with modestly improved spreads. Expenses in Asia declined 2% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending was more than offset by lower repositioning cost.","Slide six shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail, across both cards and Retail Banking. The NCL rate in North America increased from last quarter, as I described earlier, but should trend lower for the remainder of the year as the Costco conversion related losses are now behind us and we should benefit from normal seasonality. Credit trends in Asia consumer remained stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America was 4.4%, up somewhat from the prior quarter, mostly driven by lower loan growth but still in line with our near term outlook.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide seven. Net income of $3 billion grew substantially from last year on higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $9.1 billion grew 16% from last year, reflecting solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 14%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.1 billion grew 9%, driven by strong fee growth, higher volumes and improved spreads. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% from last year, reflecting a rebound in debt and equity underwriting and our continued momentum in M&A.","Private Bank revenues of $744 million grew 9% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth and improved spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $434 million were down 3% from last year on lower average volumes.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.8 billion grew 18% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.6 billion were up 19% with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Equities revenues grew 10% year-over-year, driven by an improvement in derivatives. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 3%. However, excluding the impact of prior period divestures, the business grew 12% year-over-year.","Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 1% year-over-year as higher incentive compensation was partially offset by lower repositioning cost and the benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio was 26%. And cost of credit was a benefit this quarter, driven by net ratings upgrades and continued stability in commodity prices.","Slide eight shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined significantly from last year, driven by legacy asset run-off and divestiture activity, as well as lower revenue from treasury related hedging activity. And expenses were down 11% to $1.1 billion, driven by the wind down of assets, partially offset by episodic expenses this quarter related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. While, Corp\/Other was essentially breakeven this quarter on a pretax basis, as I noted earlier, our revenues included roughly $450 million of net episodic gains this quarter and our expenses included about $100 million of related charges, resulting in a net benefit to EBIT of roughly $350 million.","Slide nine shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. As you can see, total net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars to $10.9 billion, as growth in core accrual revenues was more than offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue. Trading positions are managed on a total revenue basis, with the interest component varying based on a number of factors. So while our total trading revenues were up significantly this quarter, the contribution from net interest revenue was lower than a year ago. But this trade in, as we said in past, the trading component of our net interest revenue is by nature more difficult to forecast.","Turning to our Core Accrual businesses, net interest revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% or $280 million from last year, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, other volume growth, and the impact of the December 2016 rate hike, partially offset by lower day count and increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long term debt. On a sequential basis, Core Accrual revenues decline as the benefit of higher interest rates was more than offset by the impact of lower day count, loan mix and rate positioning actions. Adjusting for day count, Core Accrual revenues were up slightly from last quarter. And our core net interest margin declined by 1 basis point, reflecting the impact of higher cash balances.","Looking to the reminder of the year, Core Accrual revenues should continue to grow year-over-year. Assuming one additional rate hike mid-year, Core Accrual revenues should grow year-over-year by roughly $1.5 billion in total over the next three quarters, with just under two thirds of that amount coming from higher rates and the reminder mostly reflecting higher loan volumes and mix.","On slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratios improved to 12.8%, driven mostly by earnings, partially offset by $2.2 billion of common share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.3% and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% year-over-year to $65.94, in part driven by 6% reduction in our shares outstanding.","To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the second quarter. Starting in consumer, in North America, revenue growth this quarter should continue to be mostly inorganic, driven by a full quarter of revenue contribution from the Costco portfolio which we acquired in June of last year. Excluding mortgage, we expect continued growth in our North America Retail Banking franchise as well. However, this will likely be offset by lower mortgage revenues versus the prior year. And internationally, we continue to expect modest year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars with positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico.","On the institutional side, we expect Markets revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we should continue to grow year-over-year in TTS, Securities Service and the Private Bank. In Corporate\/Other, revenues and expenses should continue to decline over time as we wind down legacy assets. But the underlying EBITDA contribution we saw this quarter of about negative $350 million is a good run rate for modeling this segment going forward.","Cost and credit should be higher quarter-on-quarter, driven by the normalization of credit cost and ICG, partially offset by improvement in North America consumer. And on a full year basis, we continue to expect our efficiency ratio to be around 58%.","With that, Mike and I would be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","First, very quickie, I just wanted to get a clarifier. Did you just say the minus $350 million is a good run rate to use for holdings, going forward? I missed the last comment.","John Gerspach","Corp\/Other","Glenn Schorr","Corp\/Other, okay\u2026","John Gerspach","We don\u2019t have holdings anymore, Glenn. Holdings that folded into Corp\/Other\u2026","Glenn Schorr","The strength in DCM was great in banking in general. But I wonder if you have any thoughts on how much of the up almost 40% versus last year's disruption in the quarter versus maybe pull forward as some people thought rates might go up versus maybe it's just good environment and it's a competitive product to lending. Just curious there.","Mike Corbat","If you go back and look at the first quarter last year, which is a tough start and you look at the areas in particular. So ECM, I don\u2019t think we did as an industry we did an IPO until the middle of April. If you look at what went on, you had referenced maybe inadvertently DCM, but DCM had a tough start last year. I think had almost extraordinary March this year. And I think if you look at the pipeline of banking, banking deals. And I would say all the pieces that we expected with that momentum coming out of last year came to fruition. And I would say that the second quarter continues to feel like it has positive momentum. So I would say, coming off a very little base. But I would say the activity in client engagement was high and I think remains high going into the second quarter.","John Gerspach","I actually think the activity this quarter it's more or less of what you would think about as being a more normal quarter as opposed to something that is a big bounce off of a down quarter; and so you have an outsized a wallet out there in this quarter. I think if you take a look at historical averages, it's kind of in line, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be outsized the activity. We\u2019ve nice bounce back obviously from first quarter of last year. But as Mike said, there was virtually zero equity activity last year in the first quarter. So we got a nice bounce back there.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that, maybe last question it's a good lead into zero equity activity. In equity, cash volumes were off a lot, especially in the U.S., but you had a very good quarter. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that derivatives leading the way. Are you talking about corporate derivatives size, are you -- is that an activity in an environment collection? Or are you doing something specific to drive your derivatives business and equities? Because I would have thought you might have mentioned PB being a bigger driver; just curious for a little more color, because that's an area of work for you guys.","Mike Corbat","Glenn, we've been putting investments in equities for a while. And we like to investment we said that we\u2019ve made in both the people and the platforms in equities; we've got balance sheet to put to work; we think that we've been gaining share with our targeted clients; and I think you\u2019re starting to see some of that activity coming through now, it's one quarter. So let's string it together for a couple of quarters. But we saw good client engagement on both the corporate and investor side this time, and so we\u2019ll see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","I wanted to ask about branded cards and that outlook for the second half. You still got revenue yield feeling some pressure, but you mentioned that should get better. Can you just remind us of that trajectory of second half profitability inflection that you are looking for in cards and what the drivers are of that as things mature?","Mike Corbat","It's primarily two-fold. One is, as you'll recall, back in the middle of 2015 we began to make some significant investments in growing our proprietary product portfolio in cards. That's when we really tried to roll out the launch and everything from double cash to our various value cards, banking the reward cards, all of that. And as we said there, it takes basically 24 to 30 months for those new card acquisitions in a proprietary book to really begin to generate a positive net income. And so that 24 months coincides with the second half of this year.","And in similar fashion, when we bought the Costco portfolio, last June, we said that just do the purchase accounting, Costco would not be accretive to earnings until a full year had elapsed. And that happens to coincide with the second half of this year, as well. So we\u2019ve got both of those tailwinds that we fully expect them to be visible in our second half results. You should be able to see it, both in revenue growth and also improved cost of credit, especially as we lap some of the very high cost of credit numbers that we had in the second half of last year as we were building up loan loss reserves for Costco, in connection with the purchase accounting, so those factors.","And as I said we like the way Costco is performing; we like the momentum that we got in our proprietary cards products as well; and it's all progressing as we had expected. And so that gives us the confidence in talking about that year-over-year growth coming in the second half of the year.","John McDonald","Then just separately, could you repeat for us the net interest income, the core net interest income guidance that I think you said if there's one more rate hike. And also just let us know like how much does one 25 basis point rate hike help you? Is there any way you could just mention that for us so we could, if we wanted to add our own assumption of more rate hikes, how should we think about that?","Mike Corbat","Very rough math, John, 25 basis points rate hike should impact revenues positively by about $100 million for each full quarter that it's in effect. That's very rough math. That's all going to be dependent upon where you are with deposit is and everything else. So the initial rate hikes you might get a little bit more than a 100, subsequent rate hikes you might get a little bit less than a 100. But a 100 is a good rule of thumb to use.","John McDonald","And if we take the net interest income that you saw this quarter. How should we think about that, and as it relates to your outlook, going forward, for net interest income?","Mike Corbat","When you take a look, again, let\u2019s just focus on the Core Accrual revenues. What I said during the prepared remarks was that we expect the Core Accrual interest revenue to grow year-over-year by about $1.5 billion during the next three quarters, again assuming one more rate hike somewhere around midyear. We had roughly $300 million year-over-year benefits in the first quarter. I think you will see that if you look at slide nine of the presentation. So that was being -- we would expect full year growth to be about $1.8 billion from a combination of the higher rates and volumes for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Mike you were -- pretty strong statement around capital return. What's giving you the confidence; is it just the fact that you are feeling that much better about your capital ratios; is that regulatory conversations. Obviously, it's rolled again to speech, which you\u2019re talking about, maybe phasing out the qualitative side of things. Is that your sense that they are going to be a little bit more willing to give you credit for the excess capital you have. Just any color around that thought process on your part.","Mike Corbat","I would start here first Jim on the qualitative side of things. And I think that the work that the team has done from a qualitative perspective in terms of models and scenarios and all of the important pieces that go into your build up and ultimately your assets. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, and I think the regulators have recognized some of that progress that we\u2019ve made. And I think we feel good about the process we put in place. And obviously depending how it goes forward, we\u2019re committed to continue to improve on that. And then the other side of it is the qualitative side.","And again as I said in my opening remarks, you\u2019ll look at what we\u2019ve done here in terms of capital return and yet our ratios continue to go up; and so this quarter generating $5.5 billion of regulatory capital. And what we\u2019ve said is we got to get to a position where we\u2019re returning that access capital. That\u2019s an important piece of the math around our pathway to making sure our returns get to where they need to get. And so we\u2019ve been engaged in those conversations. We\u2019ll see when the ASC is responded to, what it looks and feels like. But again, I think we feel good about the process. We feel very good about our numbers and our ability to make big ASC and we\u2019ll continue to work on it.","Jim Mitchell","Just maybe a broader question on regulation or de-regulation, however, you want to think about it. Is there any -- have you felt like however that we\u2019re a couple of months into the new administration, has there been any kind of coalescing around some ideas that maybe go from idea to actually implementation that you feel good about? Or is it still too early to be making any kind of assumptions around some, easing around some of the regulations?","Mike Corbat","In terms of being able to point to specifics, I think it's early. But not just myself, a number of us in the industry have been very engaged with the administration and very engaged with a number of different committee members, our regulators, et cetera. And as I think we talked about before just to toe-in from the top, is an important message and signal. And I think we\u2019ve seen very clearly with the president and the administration is very for growth for jobs. And I think around that I think the presidential order that he put out, which I think is one of the first real signs along the way here in terms of what's going to be focused on and where things go. We\u2019ve obviously been involved and commented in terms of things that could be focused on, should be focused on and we\u2019ll see -- we expect the termination and that comes backward. But at this point, I would call the conversations with the administration very constructive.","Jim Mitchell","And if we -- I think concerning the noise around potentially a new glassed eagle maybe this year sort of somewhere to what they did in U.K. about ring fencing. Would that be something that would be overly onerous for somebody like you or how to think\u2026","Mike Corbat","Probably like all of you. And anytime I hear this term 21th century glassed eagle, I ask what it is and I have yet to have anybody really tell me what's there. And as you can imagine that not just myself but I'm sure others have been involved in those conversations. And I would say that the administration is focused around trying to harmonize regulations, focus around trying to take things away that are either duplicative or don\u2019t really add value. And I have yet to have anybody really explain to me what value there is in terms of either a reinstatement of glassed eagle, which in itself is strange or what 21th glassed eagle is. So we continue to ask about it but not necessarily be that focused on it. We think our business model is the right model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","I want to come back to the outlook for net interest income. And I was hoping again with same basis is what you talked about in January, I think you said the net impact of growth at that time what was Corp and at that time what was holdings. The net of those two would be a modest positive. I think it was up $200 million year-over-year. So I was wondering if you could just update that with, including obviously the comments you gave earlier, but just bring on the same basis to that would be helpful.","Mike Corbat","So in answering the earlier question from John, I mentioned that the add up of two pieces; the $300 million year-over-year growth that we saw in the first quarter; and the $1.5 billion growth that we anticipate for the balance of the year, you get $1.8 billion. Now the prior guidance that we had given of $1.2 billion had included trading related net revenue. So the two figures are not really comparable. The $1.8 billion that I'm talking about in response to John's question and the $1.5 billion of guidance, we really talked about Core Accrual revenue. Whereas the other $1.2 billion was just kind of all-in, and as I said, it included trading related revenue. So the figures just aren\u2019t comparable, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Right and that was my question, I was trying to get them comparable. Because the constant net interest income, obviously, excludes the one-off book. It holds day count, it holds currencies constant. So I understand there might be some moving pieces, going forward. But just having it on apples-to-apples basis, your best guess and outlook right now would be helpful.","Mike Corbat","I am giving you the best thing that I can do, just to give you the $1.5 billion outlook, which is reflective of the construct that that we have in place today. When we don\u2019t beat the $1.2 billion outlook previously, as I mentioned that it included trading related revenues built into that $1.2 billion. There\u2019s some downward expectations related to trading net interest revenues and the previous guidance. So what I would say is that the change in guidance right now is primarily related to assuming two additional rate increases. We had the one rate increase in March and now we've built in another rate increase in June. And there was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth that compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first quarter performance.","Matt O'Connor","I want to take a stab on the trading part, which is fine we can estimate that. How about to see legacy asset piece here that I think was about $400 million contribution this quarter. And you obviously had some sales at the end of the quarter. How should we think about deducting out that component?","Mike Corbat","Same as the guidance that we gave you back at the beginning of the year. We said our expectation would be that we called it holdings at that point in time because we had a holding segment. And we said that holdings, year-over-year, we would expect $1 billion reduction in net interest revenue. You saw that we\u2019ve had roughly a quarter of that $220 million in the first quarter in the legacy asset component of the bar chart on slide nine. And so it's still is looking about $1 billion year-over-year impact.","Matt O'Connor","And then just squeezing in one other one, beside the $100 million exit cost for the sale of the mortgage servicing unit, were there other legal or repositioning costs? I don\u2019t see anything disclosed, but it's been a busy day\u2026","Mike Corbat","Bear in mind, Matt, what you probably noticed is that we just collapsed all our expense disclosure now into one line, just called operating expense. For a while, when we were going through periods of heavy repositioning cost and heavy legal expense, we thought that it was beneficial to break those things out of the separate line item, so that we could talk separately about them. But now, as far as legal and repositioning, pretty much it's just part of our BAU activity. So it's just in the operating expense number.","Matt O'Connor","Okay.","Mike Corbat","Matt, if we had anything unusual, we call it out.","Matt O'Connor","It was very high a year ago. So as we think about the underlying expense growth of the Company, I think combined, it was in $700 million range a year ago. So just trying to figure out is there a meaningful number to adjust for or not as we think about the operating leverage and underlying trends.","Mike Corbat","The first quarter performance, again, we talked about operating efficiency targets at any year. And as you know when we talk to you about operating efficiencies, everything all-in, we don\u2019t adjust revenues and we don\u2019t adjust expenses. So that 58% target is all-in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Just one I guess maybe very detailed question. There was a drop in non-interest bearing deposits in North America of about 5% quarter-over-quarter, drop of 6% year-over-year. Could you provide some more color as to what's going on there? And does it tie-in with anything that\u2019s going on within the loan portfolio?","John Gerspach","As you mentioned, that drop was basically in our TTS business. And what we saw there was just some additional influence going into some of the interest bearing accounts coming out of the as a non-interest bearing.","Matt Burnell","Okay\u2026","John Gerspach","As companies after a while, they build-up excess cash and build up excess cash. And eventually they\u2019ll shift a little bit of it over into an interest bearing account.","Matt Burnell","And then just on the international consumer business, particularly in Latin America, Mexico statistically. Obviously, the trends are pretty positive or more positive now on a year-over-year basis. They were little bit negative. I assume some of that\u2019s seasonal on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Has there been any, in your sense, any effect of the U.S. policy on activity levels within your Mexican business?","John Gerspach","Well, I do think that the Mexico economy, at the beginning part of the year, I\u2019d say that there was somewhat of a decline in consumer confidence that did occur. I was in Mexico three weeks ago. My sense was that that had changed, it was beginning to come back. But there was definitely a drop in consumer confidence at the beginning of the year.","Matt Burnell","And then just finally, the release of the $230 million in ICG, was that entirely due to energy exposures or was the combination of factors there?","John Gerspach","Yes, there were couple of other small things, but the predominant driver was energy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","John, I wanted to kick things off with a question on capital. Basel proposed some changes to its calculation methodology for GSIB surcharges. And on balance, it feels like it's going to result in some upward pressure on your GSIB score. I know there're differences between Basel and the Fed calculations, and which one could be a binding constraint for you guys specifically. But it looks like, on balance, the changes that Basel has proposed are bit tougher for you guys. And didn't know if that's going to result in you potentially moving to a higher GSIB bucket, given some of the changes from Basel from what appears to be 3% today to 3.5%.","John Gerspach","So, in trying to piece through your questions from a capital point of view, Steven, our binding constraint, from a capital point of view, is the Fed mandated Method II calculation of GSIB. And even if the Basel committee made changes to what in the U.S. we recall Method I, the Method II score would still be the binding constraint. So if you think about it under the current regime, Method I, we're at 2%, Method II we're at 3%. As we run the numbers based upon the proposal coming out of Basel, the Method I would move to 2.5%. And so we would still stay where we are from a capital point of view with Method II being the driving factor. But then we'd have to see whether or not the Fed made any changes in their score.","The Basel will continue with their flawed methodology of converting everything into Euros, which means that as we get changes in the dollar without any change at all in our balance sheet, our capital, our score under Method I can change dramatically. So we would still expect the U.S. to do what it had done and put forward a much more balanced approach, eliminating currency fluctuation from your capital base. So we'll see how that goes. The one change, Steven, and this may be what you're driving at. Obviously, Method I is a determinant of your TLAC requirement. And so to the extent that there was a change in Method I. And then again it depends on whether or not the U.S. just adopts the flawed Method I methodology proposed by Basel, or it does again a sensible change and converts it to something that\u2019s stabilizes the impact of currency fluctuation.","Steven Chubak","And maybe just switching to revenue side of the equation, certainly the results in Private Banking and TTS have been quite strong. You alluded to within Private Banking a lot of the strength really being driven by lending side. And didn\u2019t know if you could just give us some context as to how we should be thinking about the revenue outlook for that particular business. And is this a reasonable jumping off point where off of $750 million, we should expect to see pretty steady growth?","John Gerspach","Well, I don\u2019t think that you should count on 9% year-over-year growth every quarter, Steven. But we do have a very solid Private Banking franchise. And if I give you the indication that the growth was primarily driven by loan, there\u2019s really a much more balanced growth coming out of both loans and deposits. And obviously, it's being impacted by changes in the deposit spread as well.","Steven Chubak","And just one quick question, I may, just on the NII side. I know you\u2019ve given a lot of guidance. Last quarter, you noted that we should expect to see the NIM flat year-on-year. And I am wondering, does that still apply to the core book at least or does that guidance no longer hold?","John Gerspach","No, I would say that for the core book, we would expect NIM to be maybe up slightly year-over-year. And I am hedging at that only because we have seen a lot of growth in the cash balances. You can see our cash is almost 10% of our balance sheet, at this point in time. And obviously, as that cash grows, it does impact the denominator of the NIM calculation and you get very little earnings off of cash, especially cash that we would have over in, say EMEA. So I'll hedge a little bit on NIM, going forward, but it should be up slightly. But I\u2019d ask you to focus a little bit more on net interest revenue growth.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","It was nice to see the 10.2% ROTCE ex the DTA this quarter. We do know that it typically is the peak quarter for you guys in terms of the progression for the year. But I was just wondering if you can just talk about those guide post that you had given us and your confidence in those out-year ROE targets that you\u2019ve had. And just any changes that you\u2019re thinking underneath it?","Mike Corbat","So as I said, Ken, in my opening remarks and then John reiterate, is we remained committed to numbers that we put out there; efficiency ratio, ROE and ROTCE ex-DTA. And again, I think our story is one where we\u2019ve talked about, you can map out what looks like a, at this point, a fairly typical sequential ICG year; again with good momentum, and as we see things right now; and then, obviously, talking about the back half story in terms of consumer. So we\u2019re hoping that the combination of revenue, control cost to credit, expense discipline carries through the cost of the year and that\u2019s where the franchise is focused on. And then as we go into the outer-years the third or fourth lever in there is obviously capital return. And so, we want to continue to pull out level and continue not just to focus on what the growth of the numerator looks like, but also focus on the denominator and we put those together because its confidence in terms of what we told you we're going to do.","Ken Usdin","And Mike as a follow up to that, we know you have the July, Analyst Day coming up and just wondering. Is that more about just providing color on the current strategy or should we expect anything different in terms of the overall company strategy? It's been a long time since you've done one of those. So just what should we be anticipating in general as we think about that?","Susan Kendall","I think it's another step in terms of what I described is the renormalization of the Company. One thing where I look at this quarter that in some ways, I feel quite good about this by what I told you four, five, six years ago, we're going to have an earnings deck that can responsibly describe this firm in 11 pages and probably would have taken pause at that. And so, I think our ability to go and I think really go granular with you in terms of the businesses and that things that we're doing, and I think a lot of the work that's being done from the client, from a digital prospective and some of things that either over lunch or a meetings around the calls we don\u2019t get to do. And then something depending on the reaction and how you see it that something we would like to get into, whatever it comes to be as normal rhythm of doing with you. So, I wouldn't expect because it's anything very shattering, but we plan on taking a deep into some of these strategies and hopefully showing you a few things along the way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions just on the non-interest-bearing deposits, so I heard you earlier talked about NIB and how it's not atypical to move from NIB to interest-bearing deposits overtime. But I was just wondering, if there is some seasonality as well in the first quarter that you're thinking happened to you this year?","John Gerspach","No, I don\u2019t -- I wouldn't put it on seasonality. There still is a lot of cash out there and it's always looking to fund the homes. And so, we attempt this, especially on the corporate side, we attempt to accommodate our clients as we best we can and we were saying the cash continue to build up.","Betsy Graseck","Is there anything on the deposit better aside that we should be thinking about? How you're going to your -- your deposit data at this stage in cycle still lowering here, but maybe you can give us a sense of how it's moved up over the last couple of quarters?","John Gerspach","It's actually been fairly -- I mean, we saw a little bit of a change with the December at rate hike, but its minute at this point in time that's it.","John Gerspach","Okay, so basically when we're looking at the cost of funds on the liability side, the uptake has more to do with just a net shift to non-interest-bearing deposit -- I'm sorry, non-deposit funding, is that fair statement?","John Gerspach","It\u2019s a fair statement. It's mostly driven by changes in long-term debt in the most part.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi good afternoon, my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you remind us, John, your capital ratio, your CET1 ratio obviously is 12.8%. In a new more normalized environment, as we move forward, what's your guys comfort level of where you want that to be?","John Gerspach","When Mike gave his opening comments, he talked about 11.5% being kind of at the upper end of a range, as to what we would think we would need to have to run the institution prudently. And when you think about it, if you just look at our regulatory requirements right now, they are about 10%. You add up the different buckets. We will always want to have at least now we are thinking about having a 100 basis point buffer on top of that, which get you to a 11%. There is still talk about maybe moving into that SCB type of the stress capital buffer. So that can take you to an 11.2, and so somewhere between 11 and 11.5, I think is a good range to think about right now as to what we would need to prudently run the institution.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, if there's changes coming with the new appointments to the Fed and they decide to do away with the capital charge that you and a few your peers have for operating risk. How much capital is tied up in that area right now?","John Gerspach","When it comes op risk meaning, we still have, on the order of $327 billion worth of risk weighted assets tied up in op capital. But that again, op capital is part of the advanced approach.","Gerard Cassidy","Right.","John Gerspach","So, the next question becomes, do they stay with advanced approach? Do they move to standardize? CCAR is based upon standardized. There is a whole derivation of the stress capital buffer, again was calculated in CCAR, which is based upon standardized RWA. So, I think that there is still some discussion to be had as far as what becomes the real focal point of the denominator. Is that the advanced approach or is that the standardized?","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. I noticed in the ICG this quarter obviously the trading activity was very strong for you and those are for your peers. Your Treasury and Trade Solutions numbers was a nice 9% increased. Can you give us some color aside from an interest rates moving up, helping that business? What are some of the other factors that contribute to the growth of that business considering it's one of the largest in the total banking number?","John Gerspach","Well, it's obviously client volumes I mean we will continue to gain wallet share with our clients. You can see some of the statistics they get published by the Swift and other things that we continue to gain share there, and we've got a very healthy commercial card business in Treasury and Trade Solutions as well. And that's been a real engine for growth during the last two years. It is every indication that should continue. The nice thing about the commercial cards business that gives us fee-based revenue, and so, it rises, it diversifies the business away from just being focused on rates on balances. And with the commercial card business, again, once we win that that mandate with the client, it helps us really work with them, working capital management side of business and so it becomes very, very sticky overtime.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, and then just lastly obviously you guys are global. Can you give us some color given European elections that are coming up and the political tremors we're seeing right now. How are the international markets today for your banking pipelines, trade finance, what are your guys in the front line seeing?","John Gerspach","Well, obviously, everybody's watching and we're watching French elections, we're watching the lead up to German elections. One of the things we're watching closely obviously is with Article 50 hasn't been declared, European engagement around what Brexit looks and feels like. So, I would say in the case of the UK, it's clearly been a dampener in terms of activity in the UK, not a lot of inbound FDI et cetera. But I would say that on the continent, business actually remains fairly robust, and client engagement you can look at from a calendar perspective what was done in Europe this quarter, equity debt and transactions in general. And we've got a little bit of volatility in terms of currencies and some things, and so, I'd say the pipeline right now remains pretty strong. But we'll see as we go through from round one to round two and where polling goes in terms of the French elections. I think people will be watching that transition or that [segway], pretty closely. But as of right now, things feel pretty reasonable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Just two follow ups on -- inside the global consumer bank. The first is, you talked about, John, in the past the remediation that you had to do for all of the changes in Korea from the regulatory environment and that had largely concluded I think at the end of last year. Are you seeing the reacceleration of revenue growth that you were hoping for in that region?","John Gerspach","Yes, I want to make sure, I didn't say it was over, I said that the regulatory headwinds were abating which they had and that's actually been what you've seen in the numbers now over the last couple of quarters, as we continue to have nice yield, modest year-over-year revenue growth, 3% this quarter. And again, that's a good way of thinking about that business right now, it's certainly given back to the go go years where we had much higher revenue, but you can see the momentum building in that business as we work our way through the year.","Eric Wasserstrom","But in terms of the costs associated with complying with the changes in the regulatory environment there, has that diminished at all?","John Gerspach","Well, when we talked about regulatory costs in the past, it wasn't necessarily focused on Asia, it was more focused globally, but a lot of it here in the U.S. And I'd say that cost is still running high, but it's plateaued, and that's given us now the opportunity to shift some of the investment, more away from just doing regulatory work and put investment dollars towards supporting the businesses which has been great.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. And then just one follow-up on Mexico, the investment that's going on there, what form is that actually taking? I know that there's been a lot of focus on physical branches and things, but where are those dollars being -- where would they be manifested in the actual operation?","John Gerspach","Well, there's several components to the investment program in Mexico, Eric. Core technology upgrades, branch refurbishment as you mentioned, ATM rollouts, we need to modernize a lot of the ATMs. And so we are proceeding with those planned investments as we work away through the year. I'd say that the pace of new branch construction has been a bit slower than we originally planned, just due to the some start up issues. But we are still on track to incur more than 30% of the total program cash spend this year, 2017. But naturally, due to the fact that some portion of that cash spend is going actually be capitalized. The impact on expenses were lag somewhat and it's going to increase gradually over a full year -- the next couple of years until it's fully reflected in our 2020 results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","So a couple of more detail oriented questions on the -- on branded card, I just want to make sure I understand some of the numbers and some of what you said. First on the yield, I think you mentioned that you kind of hit a floor at 9.6 and you expect that to increase to the promotional balance on Costco go away and when not. Can you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of the glide path of that number? How that can progress over the second half of the year? And ultimately, what kind of yield you can get in your branded card portfolio? And then on the credit quality, in the branded card, I think you mentioned Costco collections changes the collection process, seasoning what not, influencing the numbers this quarter. And you had about $633 million of net credit loss in branded cards, which the big increase versus 1Q and 3Q. I guess it's fair to say that that's sort of abnormally high and we should expect that run rate to normalize at a lower level in the coming quarters, is that fair?","John Gerspach","Yes, let's take the second half first. When you get to credit, the guidance that we've given you that we expect for the full year branded cards and that's branded cards all in to have an NCL rate of about 280 basis points. So, first quarter was 311 basis points, full-year average 280 basis points. So, yes, we expected to decline as we go through the year. And average out of the 280 for the full-year, so first quarter was definitely abnormally high. And again some of that was just that \"Costco bubble.\" We did have some start-up issues with the Costco portfolio. That meant that there was some difficulty people getting set up on payment plans that lead to an increase in delinquencies, we saw the 90 plus day delinquencies grow during the first quarter and then again washed out in first quarter and that's what hit the NCL this quarter.","So, absent that whole bubble, the NCL for the branded cards in the first quarter was closing to 290 basis points. So, we feel -- we do feel a little good about that guidance going forward as far as 280 basis points for credit. The question on yield, when it comes to the yield is flattening at 960, and now yes, the expectation certainly is that it does grow. I agree with you that our expectation is that, it does certainly grow, but I'm going to shy away from giving you an absolute number as to what is going to grow to only because there are so many factors that can go into that including the mix of promo balances. And if we end up with some more transactions, those yield figures should -- could possibly come down a bit, but yes, it should grow from here.","Saul Martinez","And that starts to really take place in the second half in a more meaningful way?","John Gerspach","Yes, again, my expectation is that you should see some increase in yield, first quarter into second quarter, and then you should see a larger increase in the yield second quarter to third quarter.","Saul Martinez","And on your Costco portfolio, how is the spend progressing especially the spend outside of Costco?","John Gerspach","Again, the spend is doing well, obviously, it\u2019s a little hard for us to compare history right now, because we never seen Costco spend in the first place. We only have portfolio since last June, but the out of store spend is still above that 70% figure.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I have just two quick questions, I guess maybe in a different way to look at the core accrual NIM that was 340 this quarter. What would that be ex rewards and promotions?","John Gerspach","I don\u2019t have that I am sorry.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then, I know you said legal repositioning is actually part of just the ongoing business as the usual now, but previously, you gave a guidance that was about 2.25% of assets as an on going run rate. I mean is that still what you'd consider guidance or is that you expect it to be lower in '17, '18?","John Gerspach","No, we had said, I think it was going to be 2% of revenue for 2017, and again that was just a view is to where we thought it was going to be and, but even now we thought was the -- a high figure compared to norm. We said it should reduce then overtime. But I think in terms of it being somewhere in that 2% range in 2017, if you want to think about what\u2019s in that efficiency rate, and if that changes dramatically, we'll say something.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Susan Kendall","Great, thank you all for joining us today.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","","Mike Corbat ","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the first quarter and excluding CVA, DVA, and a tax item, net income was $4.1 billion, a 4% increase over last year, translating to $1.30 per share. I\u2019ll discuss these results and then turn to two other significant items in the quarter, the Fed\u2019s objection to our capital plan, and the discovery of the fraud in Mexico. ","During the first quarter, our institutional business performed well across our products and geographies. While lower on a year on year basis, market revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter and our equities business grew its revenues and continued to make progress. Higher volumes in treasury and trade solutions led to revenue growth despite the ongoing low rate environment.","Our consumer bank again posted growth internationally, generating positive operating leverage year on year. Revenues in Asia grew, and while we continue to execute our repositioning plans in Korea, we believe revenues in that market have now largely stabilized.","In the U.S., lower mortgage refinancing activity continued to impact our retail banking business while retail services revenues strengthened year over year, showing the positive impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","In a challenging revenue environment, we made progress toward several key priorities during the quarter. Overall, we grew both loans and deposits while focusing on improving our efficiency. We continue to optimize our branch network, reduce our real estate footprint, and simplify our product offerings. We reduced our headcount by about 3,000 people, to 248,000, which helped lower our expenses by over $250 million year on year.","While assets in Citi Holdings declined at a slower pace in the first quarter as expected, we did bring the portfolio closer to breakeven. We\u2019ll continue to take advantage of more opportunistic sales as they present themselves, and we also resolved a significant legacy issue last week with the $1.1 billion settlement regarding certain private label mortgage securitizations.","The narrower loss in Citi Holdings helped drive continued progress with our deferred tax asset. After reducing our DTA by $2.5 billion in 2013, we reduced the DTA by an additional $1.1 billion during the first quarter. While our capital levels were amongst the highest in the industry, we share your deep disappointment over the objection of our capital plan.","Let me tell you what we\u2019re doing in response. First, we\u2019re engaged with the Fed, so we can fully understand their concern. We\u2019re committed to bringing our capital planning process in line with the highest standards befitting an institution of our global reach.","Let me now share with you some preliminary takeaways based on what we\u2019ve learned so far. To begin with, we don\u2019t believe this is an issue with our business model or our strategy. It also isn\u2019t an issue with our levels of capital or capability to generate capital. ","As the quantitative tests showed, we exceeded the Fed\u2019s requirements with 150 basis points cushion in the severely stressed scenario. And after generating over $20 billion of regulatory capital last year, we generated an additional $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014. ","We now have an estimated tier one common ratio of 10.4% on a Basel III basis, and at 5.6% we already surpass the supplementary leverage ratio requirement. While we clearly have a good amount of work to do to bring our capital planning process in line with the Fed\u2019s requirements, we believe we can fix what needs to be fixed in our CCAR process so we can pass the qualitative side as well.","So let me be clear. Whatever the gaps are between the Fed\u2019s expectations and our CCAR process, we\u2019ll close it. We\u2019ll devote whatever resources and make whatever changes are necessary to accomplish this critical goal. We\u2019re moving as quickly as possible while mindful of the fact that it has to be done the right way. I want and I know our shareholders deserve an industrial strength, permanent solution that paves the way for sustainable capital return over time.","We\u2019ve already begun to make changes we believe will strengthen our process. As you know, I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to delay his retirement and run our CCAR process. I\u2019ve fully empowered him to do whatever needs to be done as we prepare our next submission. It will require investment in new talent, acceleration of spend on certain system, and changes to the way we build, validate, and test our scenarios. ","While not insignificant, we believe the required investments can be funded through our productivity initiatives, consistent with other investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make in our safety and soundness, including risk management, compliance, and AML. ","In light of this, I believe the right decision is to focus our full attention on preparing for the 2015 CCAR process, which begins in the fall. Among other things, this delay in increasing our capital return means it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where we\u2019ll be able to meet our intermediate target of a 10% return on tangible common equity in 2015. ","However, our 2015 return on asset and efficiency targets remain in place and we\u2019re committed to achieving them. I should also say that although we understand our shareholders desire for more information on CCAR, we aren\u2019t able to go into further detail, as our supervisory communications with the Fed are confidential. I hope people won\u2019t misread the absence of information as an absence of action. I assure you, we\u2019re addressing this issue with absolute urgency.","Regarding the fraud in Mexico, we\u2019re progressing along several fronts. First, we\u2019ve completed our rapid review and have not identified similar issues with any other account receivables program globally other than with the PEMEX supplier program. We reviewed over 1,100 facilities with over $14 billion of receivable financings. ","Second, working closely with the Attorney General in Mexico, we\u2019re continuing our rigorous investigation into how the fraud was committed and how our controls were breached. At this point, we\u2019ve terminated one employee who we believe was criminally involved in the fraud and anyone else we find to have been criminally involved will be fired as well as referred to the Attorney General.","In addition, we expect to take action against others whose negligence or lack of compliance with our code of conduct allowed this fraud to be committed. Those responsible will be held accountable for their actions and inactions.","We also continue to pursue the recovery of any misappropriated funds. And finally, we\u2019re reviewing all of our controls and processes in Mexico and will strengthen any area we think falls short of our global standards and best practices. While we\u2019d all like a quick resolution of this issue, we\u2019re doing a lot of work and it\u2019s just going to take some time to get it done. ","In closing, Citi has a unique global platform, one which as the quarter shows, is very capable of generating the returns our shareholders expect and reserve. We\u2019ll remain focused on serving our clients and taking our franchise to the next level. John will go through the deck, and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. John? ","John Gerspach ","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First, CVA and DVA had a small impact this quarter at $7 million, compared to a negative $319 million in pretax or $0.06 per share after tax in the first quarter of last year.","And second, this quarter we took a $210 million tax charge related to corporate tax reforms enacted in two states. These reforms lowered marginal tax rates, resulting in a reduction in our state deferred tax asset for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07 per share.","Adjusting for CVA\/DVA and the tax item, we earned $1.30 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.29 per share in the first quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s results also included roughly $165 million of incremental credit costs related to the Pemex supplier program in Mexico, including direct exposure to two suppliers. ","The vast majority of these credit costs were associated with our direct exposure to OSA and uncertainty around Pemex\u2019s obligation to pay us for a portion of the accounts receivable we\u2019ve validated with them as of year-end. The remainder was associated with one other supplier to Pemex that was found to have similar issues. We have not adjusted our results for these additional credit costs. ","On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We earned $4.1 billion in the first quarter, up 4% from last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were partially offset by a decline in revenue. Our return on assets improved year over year as well, to 89 basis points.","Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year over year to $664 billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits also grew 3% to $966 billion.","On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Our expenses declined in total versus last year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Legal and related costs were $945 million in the first quarter, and repositioning costs were over $200 million. ","Excluding these two items, core operating expenses of $11 billion in the first quarter declined by over $400 million year over year. In constant dollars, expenses declined by over $260 million, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","Sequentially, core expenses were up versus last year, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, resulting from improved performance. On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 8% year over year as lower revenues were partially offset by lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit. ","The revenue decline was mostly driven by lower revenues in fixed income markets and North America mortgage origination, partially offset by growth in both equities and international consumer. ","In Citi Holdings, the net loss improved significantly from roughly $800 million a year ago to just under $300 million, driven by a number of factors, including credit improvement in North America mortgages, the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher levels of mark-to-market gains, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings assets declined by 23% year over year, to $114 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets.","Turning to Citicorp, on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 3% year over year in the first quarter while expenses increased by 2%. International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression, as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly in Korea.","However, most key drivers remain positive, with average loans up 7% and card purchase sales up 4% from last year. In addition, we began to see the benefits this quarter of our exclusive distribution agreement with AIA to provide insurance products in 11 of our Asia markets.","Korea remained a headwind. However, while we continue repositioning this franchise, we believe revenues in this market have largely stabilized and credit has remained favorable. We will continue to restructure our cost base in Korea to reflect the lower revenue. International credit costs grew 12% year over year, mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning, while the net credit loss rate remains fairly stable at 200 basis points. ","Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 6% year over year and 2% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 28% from last year, mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 5% sequentially, driven by a gain on a sale leaseback transaction. ","Branded card revenues of $2 billion were flat versus last year, as higher purchase sales and improved spread were offset by lower average loans. Retail services revenues grew 8% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. And revenues were down sequentially in both card businesses on seasonally lower purchase sales and loan balances versus the fourth quarter.","Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 3% year over year, reflecting ongoing cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. We have significantly resized our mortgage operations over the last year to reflect the change in market volumes, and we continue to rationalize our branch footprint in North America by reducing the number and size of our branches while concentrating our presence in major urban areas and enhancing our digital channel.","Even as we have reduced branches, we have continued to grow our average deposits and retail loans, each up 4% year over year. And, we\u2019ve shifted a greater amount of our mortgage originations and card acquisitions to the retail channel.","Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. In North America, credit remained favorable in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate the full year NCL rate to be in the range of 3%. Asia remained stable as well. And, in Latin America, we saw an uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates.","The higher NCL rate in the first quarter was primarily driven by Mexico card, as that portfolio continued to season. We have also seen a greater than anticipated impact on consumer behavior from the fiscal reforms enacted in Mexico last year, which included higher income and other taxes. This appears to have dampened card purchase activity and is resulting in increased card delinquencies across the industry.","Given these changes, in combination with the generally slower pace of economic recovery in Mexico, we currently expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with the 4.6% we experienced in the first quarter. ","The increase in the delinquency rate over the prior two quarters was mostly driven by our exposure to home builders in Mexico, for which we have established loan loss reserves. Any losses from these home builders may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarter. However, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserve, and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.","Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I mentioned earlier, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, and this resulted in a significant drag on our reported operating efficiency.","Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio from nearly 56% a year ago to just over 54% today, as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations, all while continuing to invest in those markets where we see growth opportunities. ","While we now believe the revenues in both North America mortgage and Korea have largely stabilized, we will continue to take actions to reduce our cost base and improve efficiency in these businesses. ","Slide 11 shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses had declined to just over $5.1 billion by the third quarter of last year, and then increased in the fourth quarter as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","In the most recent quarter, core operating expenses have been reduced again to just over $5.1 billion, and we currently expect to deliver modest reductions in each of the subsequent quarters this year. This improvement is expected to come from a variety of actions, including those examples shown on the right side of the slide.","As you can see, we have made significant progress since the end of 2012 in reducing headcount, the number of card products, retail branches, and support sites, and we expect to make further progress by year-end.","Turning now to the institutional clients group, on slide 12, revenues of $9.2 billion declined 7% from last year, but were up 28% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion were roughly flat versus prior period. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1% versus prior periods on a reported basis and, in constant dollars, revenues grew 4% year over year and 2% sequentially, as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression.","Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from the prior year on lower debt underwriting activity, as well as lower M&A revenue, partially offset by growth in equity underwriting. And, on a sequential basis, revenues were down 8%, mostly due to a pull forward of M&A transactions into the prior quarter, while underwriting revenues were roughly flat.","Private bank revenues of $668 million increased from prior periods, driven by growth in investments and capital markets products. And, lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $415 million, up from prior periods, as higher loan balances and lower funding costs were partially offset by lower loan yields.","Total markets and securities services revenues of $5.2 billion declined 12% year over year, but were up nearly 60% sequentially. Year over year, fixed income revenues of $3.9 billion declined 18%, reflecting the more muted environment in the first quarter of 2014, as well as our strong performance last year, in both securitized products and local markets rates and currencies.","Sequentially, fixed income was up over 60% on a rebound in spread product and local markets revenue, as well as growth in commodity. Equities revenues of $883 million were up 13% from last year, and over 80% from the prior quarter, mostly reflecting improved performance in derivatives. And, securities services was roughly flat, as lower net interest revenue was offset by an increase in assets under custody and overall client activity. ","Total operating expenses of $5 billion were down 2% versus the prior year, driven by reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, legal and related expenses, and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses increased by roughly $100 million, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of reduced headcount. ","On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 67% two years ago to 59% as of the first quarter. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29%, consistent with full year 2013. ","Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased year over year, driven mainly by higher investment revenues and hedging activities, while expenses also grew, mainly reflecting higher legal and related costs. Assets of $323 billion included approximately $111 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $156 billion of liquid, available for sale securities. ","Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $114 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgage. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by net paydowns.","On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.4 billion were up year over year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, as well as higher levels of mark-to-market gains versus prior period, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings expenses increased slightly year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by higher leg and related costs. ","Net credit losses continued to improve year over year, and we released $345 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages. Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 17, excluding legal and related expenses, the operating margin in Citi Holdings grew to nearly $700 million this quarter, driven in part by the higher one-time and mark-to-market gains I just referred to, while credit costs were roughly flat.","The pretax loss in Citi Holdings was just over $400 million, driven by nearly $800 million of legal and related expenses. Legal expenses were somewhat higher than in prior periods, including roughly $100 million of incremental accruals to cover the recently announced $1.1 billion settlement to resolve certain private label securitization repurchase claims. ","This represented a significant step in resolving our legacy issues, and we remain hopeful we will have better clarity on the remaining mortgage and securitization related issues in Citi Holdings, sometime this year. ","On slide 18, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings, which continued to improve through the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $71 billion of North America mortgages, down 18% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by nearly 50%, and the loss rate improved by nearly 100 basis points. We had $4.6 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, or 42 months of NCL coverage. ","On slide 19, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.8 billion in the first quarter, up from last year on slightly higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin, and down sequentially, driven by a lower day count. Our net interest margin grew to 290 basis points in the first quarter, mainly reflecting lower funding costs. As we look to the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline by several basis points, likely followed by a modest increase in the back half of the year. ","On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. As of the fourth quarter, we reported an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.6%. Subsequently, we announced that we would be required to add roughly $56 billion of operational risk RWA to our total risk-weighted assets, related to our transition to the Basel III advanced approaches.","This additional RWA resulted in a pro forma Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.1% as of the fourth quarter, and we grew our estimated Basel III tier one common ratio to 10.4% in the first quarter. Our estimated Basel III supplementary leverage ratio was unaffected by the change in operational risk RWA, and improved from 5.4% to 5.6% in the first quarter. We continue to evaluate the impact of the newly released NPR for the U.S. SLR rules, and based on our limited review to date, we believe the impact should be flat to a slight improvement.","In summary, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued progress on several fronts. Markets revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter, and while fixed income revenues were less robust than last year, we partially offset this decline with growth in equities, corporate lending, and the private bank. ","Our international consumer business continued to grow, with positive operating leverage year over year, and we continued to see growth in purchase sales across our card portfolio. We also maintained our expense discipline, and credit remained broadly favorable. We significantly reduced the drag from Citi Holdings again this quarter, and we ended the period with a strong capital position.","Looking to the rest of the year, our goal is to grow our core franchise while improving our operating efficiency and reducing the drag from Citi Holdings. In global consumer banking, we expect revenues to be somewhat flat going into the second quarter with sequential growth in the back half of the year, while core operating expenses should continue to decline each quarter.","In our institutional business, revenues will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share while maintaining our expense discipline. And, in Citi Holdings, we remain focused on resolving our legacy mortgage and securitization related issues in order to further drive the business closer to breakeven.","In the first quarter, we saw higher levels of one-time and mark-to-market revenues, which are not likely to recur. But we still expect to achieve a small positive operating margin, excluding legal expenses.","For full year 2014, in Citicorp, we expect our core operating expenses to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013, as continued repositioning and other efficiency savings should offset the impact of business growth, investment, and a continued increase in regulatory related expenses. And in Citi Holdings, core operating expenses should continue to decline, as we wind down those assets. ","Over the past six quarters, we have incurred roughly $1.7 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions we announced in December 2012. We expect to achieve approximately $2.2 billion of annual savings from these initiatives. Roughly $1.8 billion of these benefits are already included in our expense base on an annualized basis, and we have achieved an additional $1 billion of annual savings through our ongoing effort to simplify and streamline our organization as well as improve our productivity.","Of these $2.8 billion in annualized savings, approximately 40% has been reinvested in regulatory, control, and compliance initiatives. Another 40% went to fund higher volume related expenses, cover the cost of inflation, and fund investment, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition, and 20% has fallen to the bottom line to benefit earnings.","In the second quarter, we expect total legal and repositioning charges to be roughly in line with the first quarter although the mix should change to reflect an increase in repositioning charges, due in part to the acceleration of our restructuring effort in Korea. For the second half of the year, repositioning charges should decline while legal expenses are likely to remain somewhat elevated. ","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Quick question on expenses. Just to get to the high end of your efficiency ratio targets, it seems to me, if I kind of do the math, assuming flat revenues, you\u2019d have to get somewhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion more in expenses out. Is that the right way to think about it or are you assuming the restructuring and legal charges go away as part of that, or is that independent of that or is there some revenue assumption in those targets?","John Gerspach ","I think the right way to think about this is, when we put those targets out, we were talking about low single digit revenue growth back in the 2012 level. And we do think that there will be, as I mentioned, some sequential revenue growth clearly in the consumer businesses, and we actually think about sequential revenue growth towards the back end of the year in our transaction services business as well, TTS.","But overall, we are committed to hit those efficiency targets, as we established for Citicorp, in the mid-50s. You referenced the legal expenses, and as we set that target, I think another good way to think about this is when we set the target of the mid-50s, embedded in that target, we would have had about 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio set aside for BAU, legal, and repositioning.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And just maybe trying to think through the fraud loss, it was helpful that you mentioned that you\u2019ve looked across other receivable programs, is there any reason to think that we should have concerns about beyond that, those types of programs for just general corporate lending? Have you done sort of a review there? And how do we get comfort, I guess, on that front?","Mike Corbat ","As I said, we, in this instance, did what we declared a rapid review not only obviously in Mexico, but across the franchise. And I we think took a great deal of comfort from the results of looking across as many geographies and as many programs as we did. And as the normal course of business and audit and risk, we\u2019re constantly looking at and reviewing those, and I think feel comfortable with, on the lending side, the way we\u2019re coming to work documenting and doing things. So again, it\u2019s something, as an institution, we\u2019re always focused on and always kind of going after and always looking to learn from things that occur, but nothing I think that leads us to have a broader fear either in Mexico or across the rest of the franchise.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","On emerging markets, it seems like the markets have rallied there. Has there been any kind of improvement, I guess, on the market side in March as emerging markets have seemingly done a little bit better?","Mike Corbat ","We\u2019ve seen a few things. We\u2019ve kind of transitioned out a bit of the year-end malaise, which was largely focused around Fed policy or Fed stance. And I think we\u2019ve seen volumes pick up, and I think confidence result as part of that. But at the same time, I don\u2019t think you can ignore what\u2019s going on in the Ukraine or in Russia. Those things clearly continue to have an overhang on the market. So I think the overall sentiment is better, but I think there\u2019s still some things out there which I think cause people to pause.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","John, just to clarify one piece of the outlook. The net interest margin you indicated that might be down a few basis points in the second quarter. Is that for NII dollars as well? Just kind of wondering what\u2019s driving that outlook, as it would seem that day count and seasonality in cards would get better from the first quarter as we move forward in terms of net interest income dollars.","John Gerspach ","If you take a look at our NIM performance for the last several years, there\u2019s a little bit of seasonality built into the second quarter where we normally just drop by a couple of basis points. You saw, I think, a little bit of an exaggerated drop two years ago. Last year we were down about 3 basis points, and there\u2019s some preferred stock dividend trading programs that we enter into traditionally in the second quarter as do others in the industry, and they just have a tendency to depress the NIM in the quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Is that on dollars as well, John, if we think about net interest income dollars, and is there a benefit from day count in cards that will overwhelm that or setting that out?","John Gerspach ","There\u2019s one more day in the second quarter, so we will certainly benefit from that, but there normally is, as I said, a slight decline in it, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re looking at anything dramatic, and we certainly, as I said, expect NIM to bounce back up in the second half of the year.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then as we think about that roadmap to the ROA target for next year, the comments that you just made to Jim were helpful. I think we struggle a lot with how much legal and repositioning need to come down in your model to kind of get to that ROA target. Can you clarify the 200 basis point that you mentioned, the BAU legal, you just mentioned in the prior question?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, as I said, when we first established the target a little over a year ago now, built into that target, we talked about having repositioning just be more of a BAU effort, and certainly we\u2019ve had higher levels than we would anticipate of repositioning in the last couple of quarters. As we continue to work through this simplification of the business and trying to improve the productivity.","But on a BAU basis, again I don\u2019t want to parse it into how much is legal and how much is repositioning, but in general, we would look at legal and the repositioning charges to be roughly 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And then on the CCAR, understanding there\u2019s a limited amount that you can say, are you able to give us any feel for the type of CCAR processes that you need to improve? Any examples you could provide there?","Mike Corbat ","I think I called out the things that we\u2019re probably going to be most focused on around some process driven things, some model driven things, some people driven things that we\u2019re going to be focused on. And again, I think from our perspective, from the conversations or what I\u2019ve heard, not business model, not strategy, and again, I think things that will take a fair bit of hard work, but things that we feel very strongly that we can get done.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Some of the items the Fed mentioned were previously identified. How do you work to ensure against those types of expectation gaps forming again? ","Mike Corbat ","We haven\u2019t received our written communication yet, but what we didn\u2019t want to do is to wait. We wanted to be engaged from day one on all of these things, and so I think it\u2019s important that we get the written communication and that we make sure that there\u2019s good communication, good transparency around the things that we\u2019re going to do, the timeframe in which we\u2019re going to do them in, and what we think the results of that work will be. And so, we\u2019re going to be committed to doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Just a quick follow up on that last one. I just want to make sure, you said you believe the right decision is to focus the full attention on the \u201915 process?","Mike Corbat ","Correct.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Is that just a function of, like, wow, there\u2019s a lot to do, what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s a difference of a quarter? Just because I know that some of us were hoping, like, it\u2019s a cumulative process, you want to get off this zero and get moving forward this year.","Mike Corbat ","Well, again, I think as we\u2019ve described, there\u2019s no one big glaring issue to fix. We\u2019ve got a series of things that we need to address across the workstream. Several of these things - and if it\u2019s model related, as an example of one - would require validation. Those things take time. ","And what I don\u2019t want to do is find ourselves in a position of needing to rush to get a capital submission in sometime late third quarter, early fourth quarter, to not get the work done properly and not be in a position shortly thereafter, sometime mid-November, to start the official process or the go-forward process of our January submission. ","And again, it\u2019s not a question of resources, it\u2019s not a question of people, it\u2019s not a question of dedicating those things. It\u2019s wanting to make sure we\u2019re in the right place, and I think that right now, committing to going down that path is not the right thing for the institution or the shareholders, and so I want to be focused on getting to the right place to take on the fourth quarter exercise of our first quarter 2015 submission. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","So it\u2019s a management decision, not [unintelligible].","Mike Corbat ","Management decision.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Good. Back about a year ago, when you put out your slides, you had one that had that four box matrix that showed 21 markets you called underperforming and had ROAs of less than 40 basis points. I definitely remember a couple, like Turkey, like Uruguay, like Paraguay. But recently, we saw stories on Spain, you just mentioned a partial downsizing in Korea. Can you just give a quick update on where you\u2019re at in terms of that process of culling the underperformers? ","Mike Corbat ","When we look at that bucket, I think there\u2019s a couple of things you think about. It\u2019s not actually our ambition to cull that bucket. It\u2019s our ambition to actually take those businesses or those geographies and to get them to a place where they\u2019re worthy of investment from our franchise and they\u2019re creating adequate shareholder return.","There\u2019s several levers we pull as we look at those, and some of the things you just described go at that, ranging from a Turkey, where when we looked from a consumer perspective - certainly not an institutional perspective, but from a consumer perspective - we couldn\u2019t see a pathway to investment that made sense over the intermediate or longer term. So we chose to sell that franchise.","You look at a place like Korea consumer, we do see the pathway to actually getting that upscale franchise to the appropriate levels of profitability and return, but it\u2019s taking some time and some restructuring to get there. You know, again, you saw us, in that bucket, we\u2019ve closed five, we announced six, which was Honduras, where we just felt, after working with the business teams on the ground and in the product, we couldn\u2019t get there. ","And then you\u2019ve seen others. One you mentioned in terms of Korea, where restructuring has been required, and there are others. And those are work in progress, and against that bucket, I\u2019m happy to say we think we\u2019ve made good progress. More to do, and again those buckets aren\u2019t static, and so we\u2019ve had some of those businesses and some of those geographies move out of that bucket and move up, and to stay the course, which is where you\u2019d like to get them or invest to grow. But work in progress, but making progress. ","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","I\u2019m not sure if I saw it anywhere. Did you state your return on tangible common for corp and Holdings separately? And if not, could you?","John Gerspach","The closest that we can give you to that would be slide 25 in the earnings presentation. It\u2019s the first slide of the appendix. And we have not yet formally done the allocation of the TCE for you, between corp and Holdings. We will be doing that later this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","One more CCAR question. Based on what you know now, is your thought process to ask for buyback in the next submission, or do you need to kind of get through one clean before you ask for capital deployment above what you\u2019ve been doing?","Mike Corbat ","I think at this point clearly we\u2019re focused on the process, and what goes into that is environment, earnings, and all those things. But I think as I\u2019ve consistently said, if the stock is trading below, and trading meaningfully below, the math would strongly push you towards buyback versus dividend. But as we\u2019ve always said, we understand there has to be a balance. And I think if you looked at the quantitative submission we made this year, it was a balance between dividend increase by largely skewed toward buyback. ","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And even in terms of working through some of the changes the Fed wants you to make, at this point, do you think you\u2019ll be confident enough to ask for any sort of capital deployment for next year in the \u201915 process, or do you think some of these things we\u2019re seeing at other banks, and just take some time in terms of model validation and things like that?","Mike Corbat ","I think right now we\u2019re focused on getting the process right. I think what we saw, one of the takeaways from the Fed process this year is there continues to be more and more delineation between the qualitative and the quantitative side. But I think we\u2019ve got several months of work to do here. We\u2019ve got a year to deliver in terms of earnings and quality of earnings in the things we\u2019re doing, and then we\u2019ll make that assessment.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And I realize next year, asking about expenses, you\u2019ve given us the official targets that were unchanged, you gave us expense guidance this year, but as we think about the investments that you\u2019re making for things like CCAR and regulation, it will obviously be kind of a full run rate for next year, assuming you\u2019re spending throughout this year. I guess the question is, how should we think about cost all-in for next year, and are you still counting on low single digit revenue growth for those efficiency targets?","Mike Corbat ","We\u2019ve given you the expense guidance for this year, we\u2019ve given you the reaffirmation of achieving the efficiency target for next year. And we\u2019ll get more into detail as far as 2015 expenses perhaps later in the year.","Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank ","And just lastly, on capital, the DTA usage was quite a bit ahead of last year\u2019s pace this quarter, above $1 billion. Is that a decrease run rate assuming earnings stay around here? Or was there something unusual from that tax hit that might have increased that?","Mike Corbat ","If you think about the components that led to the $1.1 billion, it\u2019s actually $1.1 billion of the DTA utilization came from Citicorp earnings. The Citi Holdings losses actually added $200 million to the DTA, and then the impact of the state tax law changes reduced DTA by $200 million. So basically, Holdings and the state tax law changes netted themselves out, and what fell to the bottom is the $1.1 billion. ","So I\u2019d say there\u2019s really three variables that you have to think about. One is what is the level of Citicorp earnings? And clearly, at the level that we\u2019ve produced in the first quarter, that\u2019s going to have a DTA utilization of $1 billion or more. ","The second would be the impact of DTA from Holdings losses. Generally, as we drive Holdings losses down, that should lessen the upward pressure on DTA. And then the third aspect would be OCI. And in this quarter, OCI actually just had zero impact on the DTA. But depending on what happens with OCI, that could either be a slight positive, meaning a reduction in the DTA, or a slight increase.","So I hate to take you through the long walk, but those are the three variables that you really have to establish.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","John, could you share with us some color, you mentioned that there was strength in the equity trading area within the capital markets due to derivatives. What kind of derivatives were you guys seeing that helped that area?","Mike Corbat ","What we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our derivative franchise, and in this case our equities derivatives franchise, is largely client, and in this case largely corporate client related. Again, kind of matching against who our traditional client base is. And so we\u2019ve been building up the sales and trading capabilities there. We\u2019ve called it out in the past as an area of emphasis. ","And while one quarter does not a true trend make, I think we\u2019re making progress and the investments that we\u2019ve made in that are starting to pay benefit. And so again, I think as you think about it, it\u2019s largely on the client side, and it\u2019s largely in particular on the corporate client list of where we\u2019re getting the penetration. ","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","On the debt gain that you had in Citi Holdings, what was the dollar amount of that?","Mike Corbat ","It was less than $100 million. It was something close to, I think, $80 million.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And I thought I saw you had a sales leaseback gain? Did you guys say in the first quarter? Or did I not read that correctly in the press release?","Mike Corbat ","No, we did. That would be reflected in the North America retail business.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And what was that dollar amount?","Mike Corbat ","That was something in the $70 million range.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","What do you think you\u2019ll issue this year in terms of incentive comp for shares to employees?","Mike Corbat ","I don\u2019t have that share count in my head, I\u2019m sorry. But it will be somewhat similar to what we issued last year, I think. Maybe up or down just a little bit. But roughly in line.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then finally, in the communication that you guys pointed to with the Fed, regarding CCAR, is this with Washington? Or is it with New York? Are you comfortable that you\u2019re reaching out to the right people so that there\u2019s no miscommunication?","Mike Corbat ","It\u2019s in concert with both. Obviously, we\u2019ve got local and we\u2019ve got onsite Fed people here. Those are largely New York Fed. But the CCAR process is run centrally and largely run through that centralized process out of Washington. So I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us to make sure that we\u2019re communicating with both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","So you just answered the question about the size of the debt gain in Holdings. The mark-to-market that you referred to, could you roughly size that for us as well?","Mike Corbat ","There were a couple of those things. Rather than try to tease through the whole thing, I think if I was taking a look at the Holdings performance, I would say that, to the extent that we point to some of these outsized gains, I think the best way to visualize that is actually that four-box chart that we give you on slide 17. And you can see that the adjusted operating margin for Citi Holdings, for the last three quarters, was roughly running at that $500 million or so level. And this quarter, it ticked up to $700 million. And I\u2019d say that you wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you assumed that the outsized contribution of those one-time items was the differential between the $500 million that we have been running and the $700 million that we ran this quarter.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","In terms of the mark-to-market, was it strictly a mark-to-market? Or was it a mark prior to a sale? In other words, what I\u2019m really trying to do is get a sense for the environment with respect to your ability to continue to sell down assets, or whether at this point we really should assume that that stuff is pretty much buckled down, and it\u2019s just one-offs from here.","Mike Corbat ","Is your question specifically on mark-to-market assets, or is that against the overall Holdings portfolio?","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Let\u2019s talk more broadly about the portfolio.","Mike Corbat ","I think the environment is fine to continue to look at opportunistic sale. And so not uncharacteristic from the past, you get a pretty big fourth quarter where you\u2019re trying to kind of get everything closed, and obviously the buyers like to get things done, and we do as well for year end. I think in the first quarter, you begin kind of setting up for the things you want to do. ","You know, we\u2019ve laid out that it\u2019s the highest priority, to continue to work Holdings to breakeven, but we are going to be very focused on opportunistic sales and continuing to get assets down, risk out of the organization, capital released. And I think the environment is fine. You can see from the way we and others are describing credit, and we\u2019re describing the continued recovery in the U.S., again I think if the prices are there you should expect that we\u2019re going to continue to make some progress.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And while we\u2019re on Citi Holdings, just on the expense side, I\u2019m cognizant of what you\u2019re saying about the outlook going forward, but the expense structure there overall has been surprisingly sticky, given how the assets have come down and the sales that you\u2019ve been able to pursue. And I\u2019m wondering if, at this point, we should start to expect some step function kind of expense cuts in Holdings.","Mike Corbat ","You know, when you take a look at the expense structure in Holdings, obviously the legal expenses in Holdings have been running fairly high, and at some point in time, you should expect a step function down in mode. But from the core operating expenses, we\u2019ve been pretty religious about driving those down in proportion to the asset reductions that we have achieved. ","Now, there\u2019s some mix issues there. Some assets are a little bit more expense intensive than others. You can imagine that the mortgage business that we have, that is a little bit more expense focused, there\u2019s a little bit more expense associated with maintaining that business, than with mark-to-market assets. So it may be sticky from here, but those core operating expenses still should run down as we reduce the assets. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","As we look at the expense structure on the Citicorp side, you\u2019ve got a slide in the back of the appendix that mostly seems to be making some adjustments for how you distributed the corporate and other expenses out to the units. But is there any change in the efficiency ratio target that you\u2019re looking at in terms of a reallocation of expense cuts between the institutional and the consumer sides within Citicorp? Or is it all just exactly as it was, just reallocated for those corporate expenses?","Mike Corbat ","The only change that we\u2019ve made is to reflect the change in allocation of corporate expenses. That\u2019s it. The mid-50s target stays in place for Citicorp, and everything else is just math.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Final question for you on the SLRs. That was, I assume, computed entirely within the Fed\u2019s new NPR, which reflects the January BIS leverage ratio guidance?","Mike Corbat ","The 5-6 reflects everything but what the Fed came out with last week, and as we looked at those changes, that\u2019s where we said, if we were to apply those changes, the daily calculation for off balance sheet items, for instance, and some of the changes in netting, there we would estimate that the 5-6 would either be flat or perhaps increase slightly.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And just as a follow up to that, in terms of the SACCR, as the BIS is now calling it, do you have any estimate as to what that might do?","Mike Corbat ","I\u2019ve got to tell you, Guy, you threw me with the SACCR.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","Oh, that\u2019s the new standardized approach counterparty credit risk adjustments that the BIS put out in March, but the Fed hasn\u2019t put out an NPR yet on it.","Mike Corbat ","I can\u2019t answer that directly, I apologize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","So just to follow up on that last question, I think in prior conference calls you indicated that the Basel rules would be additive on the SLR, maybe 30 to 40 basis points, if I recall correctly? ","Mike Corbat ","I think that what we\u2019ve said is that, at least in the last statement that we gave you, was that our early read on what the U.S. was proposing was that it might increase our reported SLR by about 10 basis points. And so all we\u2019re doing now is changing that to say it should be flat to slightly positive.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then just separately, you indicate at the beginning of the call that the whole CCAR process doesn\u2019t have any implication for the business model, mix shift, etc. But I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about some of the smaller geographies that you\u2019re embedded in. You did have an office closure recently in Latin America, and just in the context of the repositioning that you\u2019re expecting to continue doing here over the next year or so, how much of that is skewed U.S. versus non-U.S.?","Mike Corbat ","Most of the things that you\u2019ve seen, and the one that you\u2019re talking about, Honduras, are small consumer franchises. So if you look at what we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s Uruguay, Paraguay, etc., those have been subscale consumer franchises where we didn\u2019t see the path to profitability and adequate returns through investment or restructuring. So again, in that optimized bucket, we continue to look at those. We continue to work on it, and I think we\u2019re at this point where we feel like we\u2019ve got a business plan going forward against those that are there, a restructuring plan against those that are there, and we\u2019re going to go execute against that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","So we should expect to see some more of those kind of Uruguay\/Paraguay? Or you\u2019re pretty much done?","Mike Corbat ","I think we\u2019re pretty much done against those. We\u2019ll always look under review. And one thing that I\u2019ve said is when we look at CCAR, as an example, and if there are things there from a data or information perspective that we just don\u2019t have a pathway to get a clear handle on and fix, we\u2019ll obviously reassess things based on that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","The first question I have is a two-parter, specifically relating to preferred issuance. John, on the most recent fixed income call, you noted that you plan on issuing higher levels of preferreds to approach the 150 basis point tier one capital buffer commanded under Basel. Does the delay in the planned capital actions impact the timing of your preferred issuance plans? And what level of preferreds are contemplated as part of your 2015 profitability targets?","Mike Corbat ","We\u2019re going to have more to say about the preferred issuance and the capital structure in our fixed income call, which is on Thursday.","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","Okay. And then switching gears to FICC, one of the things you mentioned on the press call is that you speculated that the FICC fee pool is likely shrinking, and you anticipate a 5% to 10% decline in 2014. I didn\u2019t know if that guidance contemplated the expectation for continued market share gains. ","And presumably, if the regulatory or environmental headwinds continue to weigh on FICC, which we\u2019ve seen over the last few years, heavier gearing to flow oriented or transactional activities in local markets should certainly make you better plays.","John Gerspach ","The commentary I made as far as FICC being down 5% to 10%, I had intended to mean to overall FICC market as opposed to giving any specific guidance on our FICC revenues. But that would certainly be where we would take a look at the overall FICC market for this year. ","As I said in the press call, if you just look at the last couple of years with FICC, it certainly appears to be a shrinking pie. To date, we\u2019ve been able to gain share, but there\u2019s a limit to just how much share you\u2019re going to be able to gain. ","And what we have done, though, is we\u2019re not fighting the trend. We are actively managing our expense base and assessing our capacity. And we\u2019ve reduced the capacity, we\u2019ve reduced expenses, and we\u2019ll continue to operate in that fashion.","We had said early on that our FICC business, for the most part, is much more of a flow business. And that remains in effect. That\u2019s not a change for us. We\u2019ve been operating that flow model for several years now. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","And just one more from me on the DTA. Based on the 10-K disclosure, it looks like timing-related DTA still represents close to half of the total balance outstanding. So roughly $25 billion, a not insignificant sum. The cumulative loan loss reserve that we\u2019re modeling going forward is supposed to be a pretty meaningful driver of timing related consumption. ","That appears to be getting closer to exhaustion, and it appears to only make a small dent in the remainder going forward. I was just hoping you could help us identify some of the other levers which will help drive that timing related DTA utilization, just because it\u2019s such a large drag on your excess capital positioning. I think it\u2019s roughly a $13 billion deduction based on current calculations ","Mike Corbat ","There are a plethora of items that constitute timing differences when you\u2019re looking at the difference between GAAP income and taxable income, both including revenue recognition differences as well as expense recognition differences and some of the issues that you\u2019re pointing to as far as loan loss reserves. ","I can\u2019t give you a succinct rundown of all of those things. LLR clearly is a piece of that, and as you look at our LLR, when you say it\u2019s pretty much run its course, you\u2019re probably not that far from being off from a Citicorp point of view, but don\u2019t forget that the LLR then we have in Citi Holdings. We\u2019re certainly not looking to grow Citi Holdings, so that is LLR that still should be run off. So there\u2019s a variety of issues that can add to that DTA timing difference. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","Are any of them potential levers that we could actually input in our models?","Mike Corbat ","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","John, maybe dovetailing on part of your response to that last one, you had 42 months of coverage in holdings, up from 39 three months ago. The reserve coverage has gone up by 3 months, life portfolio has gone down by at least three months. Could you kind of relate the life of that portfolio to it, and how we should think about that 42 months coverage as we go forward?","John Gerspach ","Just to be specific, the numbers that you\u2019re referring to isn\u2019t for all of Holdings. That\u2019s just the North America mortgage. And there, it\u2019s not so much driven by the life of the portfolio. One of the big drivers there is the percentage of loans that we have in troubled debt restructuring status. Because as you get into TDR loans, in effect the LLR that you have is really almost like a present value of a full lifetime loss. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the overall level of LLR that we have in that book.","So you\u2019ve got two things that drive the LLR. One is the amount of TDRs that we have. And I believe that the overall portfolio right now has a total TDR of somewhere between 20% to 25% of the portfolio is made up of TDRs. Importantly, when you take a look at the CFNA component of the portfolio, it\u2019s roughly 35% to 40% of the CFNA portfolio that\u2019s in TDR status.","The second key driver of the amount of loan loss reserves that we have would be the reset that we\u2019re looking at in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917 for the home equity loans. So those are two things that are actually going to continue to keep that, I think, relatively high for some time.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And just to follow up, should we assume that those TDRs, as you\u2019re resolving them, they\u2019re being resolved either kind of inside of the reserves that have been set up, meaning the values that have been getting better over time? ","John Gerspach ","Yeah, you haven\u2019t seen us adding dramatically to the reserve, and I think we\u2019ve been fairly steady, at least the last several quarters, at something around 90% or more reserve utilization against the NCL that the mortgage business has generating. And again, I think the words that we would use would be that we expect the vast majority of the NCLs that we have in mortgages should be covered by loan loss reserves. I don\u2019t want to get tied down to a 90%, but again, it should be fairly high.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","You talked a fair amount about the restructuring outside the U.S. When you\u2019re doing that sort of activity in the U.S. retail business, is it that you\u2019re going to be exiting cities, or going to be kind of reducing the density within the cities. Or how should we think about the pace in the U.S. business?","Mike Corbat ","What we\u2019ve tried to do is not just internationally or just in the U.S. make sure we\u2019re approaching the retail strategy in a unified way, and that is really an urban-based approach to consumer banking. In the numbers, in the deck, we speak to a reduction of branch footprint, and that\u2019s not just international, that\u2019s not just domestic. It\u2019s a mix of those. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at branch profitability, branch efficiency, and continue to act against that.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","You had mentioned kind of the $20 billion of capital generation last year and $6 billion this quarter, is it fair to think about the way you will be thinking about capital return for 2015 against those numbers, or against reported earnings? How should we be thinking as the base of that?","Mike Corbat ","I think at this point we\u2019re very focused on getting the process, and in particular the qualitative side of the process, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to speak to that approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","I wanted to ask you about your confidence in the ROA targets and efficiency targets for next year. How much leeway do you have if in fact the revenue environment doesn\u2019t pan out? It\u2019s obviously been a tougher start than we all would have liked in the 12 to 15 months since you put the targets out originally. So if in fact we do have a tougher time from here to 2015, how much flexibility do you think you have on the expense side? And then within that flexibility, how far do you have before you actually do start worrying about cutting into muscle?","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019re right, when we put these out we spoke to a couple of things. We spoke to the fact that we thought we were in a challenging revenue environment and I think the 13 to 14 months since we made that pronouncement, I think that\u2019s been proven correct. ","I think the other thing that we talked about was that as part of that environment, we didn\u2019t see, nor were we counting on, a big uplift in terms of interest rates to be able to achieve our targets. And we\u2019re going to achieve these targets through a few things. ","One is low single digit revenue growth, continued expense discipline, and a continued push across the franchise to continue to wind down Holdings. And obviously the Holdings piece is the ROA piece of things. ","And again, I think you\u2019ve seen, methodically in the institutional side, the work that Jamie\u2019s done in terms of quarter on question, continuing to bring down expenses. Manuel\u2019s been fighting the headwinds obviously of mortgage in Korea, but again, sequentially, or largely bringing those expenses down on a quarter on quarter basis, and again, continue to that path, and continuing to take actions against it. ","You saw the announcement that came out last night. You know, small, but again, I think symbolic of the effort in terms of another reduction in terms of ICG staff. Again, I want the businesses to be ongoing in their focus of managing to this ratio.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","So if we didn\u2019t get back to that path where you see the path to a low single digit revenue growth, I guess where within the franchise would you have to look? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much capacity do you still have to make adjustments on top of these changes you\u2019ve already clearly made and have largely been working through the run rates, to John\u2019s earlier points.","Mike Corbat ","Part of the reason of having an efficiency ratio out there is to have this not just focused on expenses. What we don\u2019t want to do is be making bad decisions around investment or how we\u2019re thinking about our franchise. There\u2019s got to be the balance between revenue and between expense. And I think that we\u2019ve got to keep that balance. So we\u2019re going to keep pushing away on the expense side of things. Obviously we\u2019ve got work to continue to do on the legal side of things, and we\u2019re not counting on big revenue growth to be able to achieve it.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","And my one follow up on the reserve release side, this quarter you saw continued nice releases out of card and also in the institutional group. And John, going forward, I was just wondering if you can help us understand the mix of reserve release that you expect or have we kind of gotten towards the end, as you had been saying in prior quarters, about the magnitude of release we could still be seeing out of a corp side.","John Gerspach ","I continue to think that the reserve releases will flow in card. Can you still anticipate having some for at least the next quarter or two? Probably. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re done, but they should be reduced. ","The reserve releases this quarter really came out of both branded cards in the U.S. and retail services. Branded cards, we\u2019re now down to an NCL rate of something in the 3.5%, and retail services, we\u2019re roughly at 4.5%. I don\u2019t see those NCL rates getting better at this point in time. So I don\u2019t anticipate continued reserve releases at the levels that we had out of those businesses in the first quarter. ","You referenced ICG. ICG is a bit more episodic when it comes to either reserve builds or reserve releases or the recognition of NCL. And a lot of times, what you see there is the release of the reserve when we take an NCL. Because we would have had, for a particular credit, a reserve established, and therefore when you recognize the NCL, you release the reserve against it and it\u2019s a perfect marriage. So that\u2019s a little bit more difficult to predict, but certainly from consumer, it should be declining. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company ","And ICG, was that exemplary of the Mexico extra losses you mentioned? Was that one that you just went right against the reserve this quarter?","John Gerspach ","No, that, for the most part, was an NCL.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I just had two follow up questions. First, on the conversation you had with Guy, can we take away from that, given your guidance for lower core operating expenses in holdings, that the pace at which holdings assets can decline from here could decline greater than the 3% pace we saw this quarter?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019m trying to make sure I\u2019ve worked through the construct of your question. If the assets decline at more than 3%, then the expenses might decline by more than 3%. That\u2019s going to just depend a little bit, as I said before, on which assets come down. If it\u2019s mortgage related assets, then yes, it should come down probably a little bit more than that. If it\u2019s a mark-to-market asset, it probably won\u2019t have the same impact on the overall expense base. But again, roughly speaking, as we reduce assets, we bring the expenses down in line with those asset reductions.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I thought you had a strong message on core operating expenses coming down in Holdings for the rest of the year, and sort of given the message that this is really tied to the assets, I was just wondering whether it was fair to assume that the pace of asset declines was going to accelerate from here. But I get the message.","And Mike, I apologize for re-asking the same question over and over again, but just to follow up in terms of what Matt and Moshe had already asked you, I think it\u2019s very clear - and thank you for the detail in terms of taking the steps to get the qualitative aspects of the CCAR correct - but assuming that you have made that progress a year from now, is the pace at which you ask for capital return from the Fed going to be dictated by the actual excess capital that you have? Or do you feel that your initial request, after you complete the qualitative process to their satisfaction, going to be more conservative?","Mike Corbat "," ","I think as I said in the statement, we recognize we\u2019ve got to get what we do industrial strength. When Citi operates properly, and you saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the ability to generate large amounts of regulatory capital. Regulatory capital in excess of our earnings. And so we need to get the institution to a position to be able to be returning significant amounts of that capital over time. I can\u2019t tell you, kind of going into this to where we are today, what that capital ask will be next year, but we\u2019ve got to get the institution into a position where, over time, we\u2019ve got the ability to return that capital. ","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Okay. I tried. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Related to CCAR, who at Citigroup is accountable for the failed stress test? And what are the consequences?","Mike Corbat ","I am. Obviously, when you think of something that is as important as this for the institution and our shareholders, it\u2019s at the top of the house. So I\u2019m accountable, and if you read our filings, it is in my scorecard, and it\u2019s something for which I\u2019m sure the board will hold me accountable in 2014 when they reflect upon the year. And I\u2019m accountable for it, and I\u2019m accountable for fixing it.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Who else is accountable, and what are the consequences? Can you be specific? I think I hear you saying you\u2019ll be paid down because you didn\u2019t pass, but that\u2019s one aspect. Another aspect is making sure you have the right team on the field to ensure that you have the appropriate regulatory relations.","Mike Corbat ","What I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve made changes. I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to step back from his retirement and to take responsibility, working directly for me, in terms of our CCAR submission this year. And Gene has access to work across the firm, in terms of the things that need to be done, to make sure that submission is of the caliber and quality that it needs to be. And I\u2019ve got full confidence in Gene, and I have full confidence in the team we have to get to that point, because Gene\u2019s not going to be able to do it alone.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Why is the Fed\u2019s denial, the information related to that, only preliminary? And can you disclose some of the shortcomings without disclosing some of the exam findings? It\u2019s very frustrating for many investors not to have more information.","Mike Corbat ","As the findings and the conversations that we have, not with just the Fed, but with our regulators, are confidential, I think the Fed has actually been fairly forthcoming with the public when they made their announcements in terms of that there wasn\u2019t any one particular thing, there were things across the series of work streams that were submitted. ","And again, I called out things in terms of some general approaches to some processes, some things that need to be changed, in terms of our modeling, the way we vet certain risks within the organization, and the combination of people, modeling, and validation, as well as some other things go at those. ","And so in there, there\u2019s not one big thing I can point at and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the fix.\u201d We\u2019ve got a number of things that we need to be focused on, and again, I think they\u2019re all fixable, and we\u2019re going to be focused on fixing them and creating the industrial strength process that we need to have. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Perhaps the more general question, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for Citi, or not? And what I think I\u2019ve heard you say on this call is that several areas are doing better - markets, Korea, Holdings, etc. - their optimized bucket is about done, you\u2019re making some of the process changes after the Fed denial, you\u2019re okay with your efficiency and ROA targets. So you\u2019re kind of giving us a little bit of a roadmap for the next seven quarters, but the way I look at it, Citi has failed two of the last three CCARs, it\u2019s been 16 years of a failed merger, and for shareholders, it\u2019s been two lost decades. Two decades ago today, the stock was 10% higher. So again, my main question is, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for you guys?","Mike Corbat ","I\u2019ll speak for myself and the management team, and I\u2019ll let the board speak for themselves. We\u2019re wide awake. This obviously came as a disappointment. And again, I\u2019m responsible for it, but if you look at, over the last 15, 16, 17 months in the job, the things that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve taken headcount down 18,000 people, net of adding 16,000 people across audit risk\/compliance. We\u2019ve had sequential improvements in expenses across our ICG businesses. We\u2019ve addressed seven underperforming consumer businesses. ","We\u2019ve set out intermediate - and again, I underline the word \u201cimmediate\u201d - targets, the ROA, the ROTCE, and the efficiency ratio targets. And we predicated our ability to hit the ROTC on our ability to return some capital. That\u2019s now proven difficult to do, but committed around the ROA, and committed around the efficiency targets, and we don\u2019t view that as the end state of the company. ","We talked about DTA consumption and our ability to change that, and there have been those historically who were quite critical of our ability to consume DTA, and I think we\u2019ve proven. We came in and we said, it\u2019s a priority, $2.5 billion of DTA utilization last year, $1.1 billion for the first quarter of this year, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to consume it. ","And so we\u2019ve got things we\u2019ve got to do. We understand. We are not sitting here without a sense of urgency, and if anybody feels that way, they shouldn\u2019t feel that way. And we\u2019re committed to pushing the firm forward. And again, in there, we\u2019re coming with those actions every day.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","One conclusion that I reach from the Fed\u2019s denial is that they\u2019re encouraging Citigroup to simplify. Would you agree that that is a push by the regulators and the Fed?","Mike Corbat ","I think that simpler is always easier in a process like this. Again, in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, the conversations have not been about the business model or the strategy. Again, it\u2019s incumbent upon us, and we completely recognize it. We if don\u2019t have the ability to speak to, to model, and to overlook, govern, and control our organization, then yes, we shouldn\u2019t be in that business, or we shouldn\u2019t be in that geography. But I think we\u2019ve got the ability to do those things, and in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the statement.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Okay. Well, I hope the Fed gives you any more information that would be helpful for investors before your annual meeting next week, and I look forward to asking questions of the board. Will you webcast the annual meeting next week? Because that would allow the board members to disclose material information.","Mike Corbat ","We are not going to be webcasting.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","All right. Well, I hope someone can change their mind there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","John, the mortgage originations were down, it looks like, about 37%. And [favorable] rate lock is down about 20. So what would that have translated into in terms of mortgage income for the period?","John Gerspach ","The mortgage revenues for the first quarter were down single digit numbers from where we were in the fourth quarter. So as we\u2019ve said, the mortgage revenues pretty much now have stabilized at around the fourth quarter levels.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","So I guess that implies that there was some kind of benefit on the servicing side to offset the decline in origination?","John Gerspach ","Actually, the spreads have held up fairly well. We changed the mix to be less reliant on purchased mortgages and more reliant on mortgages that we\u2019re now originating out of our branches, which is a better returning business for us. So again, we\u2019ve changed some of the mix of the business, but in general, as I said, the revenues have largely stabilized in that business.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then just to reconcile that against, you know, adjusting in the North American retail banking business, just excluding the sale leaseback, it looks like you would have been down only 2%. So what would have accounted for the difference?","John Gerspach ","There\u2019s continued spread compression that we continue to have in that business. Even as we grow deposits, in the low interest rate environment, on a deposit-oriented business, you\u2019re going to run into revenue pressure.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And did I also understand you that credit card volumes in the period across both the proprietary branded and the retail were down more or less in line seasonally? Is that the correct understanding?","John Gerspach ","From an A&R point of view, or an E&R point of view, the net receivables in those two businesses did exhibit the normal performance that you would have in the first quarter as far as balances being down from where they were in the fourth quarter. However, for the industry, as well as for us, we continue to remain challenged with an overall decline in the A&R and in the E&R. Certainly in our branded cards business, you\u2019ll see a decline year over year. And so that just reflects the continued deleveraging on the part of the U.S. consumer and the resulting high payment rates that we\u2019ve been experiencing.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","I was also referring to the charge card volume, if that would have looked different than what the typical seasonal trend would have implied.","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t think so.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And then just lastly, on CCAR, understanding that some of the issues are preliminary, I\u2019m just trying to understand the broad scope of all your statements. But perhaps if you could just help me understand, how satisfied are you today that you understand what all of the criticisms are?","John Gerspach ","I think at this point we\u2019ve had conversations. I won\u2019t be fully satisfied until we get the written response, and then we close the gap or we close any questions or differences that we may have from what\u2019s in that letter. But again, around the conversations, and it\u2019s been, I would say, good, active, fairly constant engagement to date. Again, I want to see the letter. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be surprised by the letter, but I need to see it.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","And just sort of rolling that forward to resubmission, putting aside any capital return dynamics, how much progress do you think you\u2019re expected to show on these issues at that point? And is it possible to actually have accomplished that?","John Gerspach ","I think the way we need to think of things is we run an institution of global importance, and we shouldn\u2019t set the standard to whatever the Fed standard is. We should set the gold standard in terms of what our approach to the process should be. And I\u2019m comfortable with Gene\u2019s leadership and coordination from the rest of the team we\u2019re going to have the ability to do that, but also, recognizing that that\u2019s not going to be static. Our work\u2019s not going to be static. The bar\u2019s not going to be static, and we\u2019re going to have to continue to go at this every year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","First of all, in terms of the SLR guidance versus last quarter, John, as you said, you thought that the new U.S. rules would benefit you by about 10 basis points. You\u2019ve updated that to flat to up modestly. I guess I\u2019m curious, given what JPMorgan said last week, that potential netting of derivatives and some of the new U.S. rules might help them by 30 to 40 basis points, where you might see some differences between the benefit you\u2019re estimating and the benefits that they might be estimating.","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t know what they baked into their original estimates, so I have no way of commenting on how my view of the changes would differ from their view of the changes. I can just tell you where we are and where we would expect to be.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then in terms of the Basel III RWA, on an average basis, those were up about $55 billion in Citigroup, a little bit more than that, $57 million in Citicorp. What drove the increase in the RWA? Was it model rejection or was it something else?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d focus you on slide 20. That\u2019s probably the easiest place to see it, because it deals with quarter end balances. And so from a quarter end balance point of view, with both quarter ends reflecting all of the changes, the incremental op risk, what you see there is about a $27 billion increase in our risk-weighted assets from the fourth quarter going through the first quarter. ","So about a third of that increase is in fact due to the loss of model approvals as we\u2019ve exited from parallels. So that\u2019s exactly the impact that you were looking for. And then that requires us to use alternate approaches, which just adds a little bit to the risk weighted assets. And that would be primarily in market risk.","And then the balance is primarily just due to an increase in lending and commitments. You\u2019ve seen how our loan book has grown. We\u2019ve got additional commitments there. And so that\u2019s just a general business driver. ","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then lastly, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to believe in some revenue stability in Korea. And maybe this is putting the cart before the horse, but I guess I\u2019m just curious as to, given where you stand today, what the timing might be for potential revenue upside in the Korean franchise, now that you\u2019ve stabilized it.","John Gerspach ","Well, I would say that there is a good shot that we will have sequential growth coming from Korea, again, certainly in the back half of the year. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. Obviously revenues, we think they\u2019ve stabilized now. I think when you\u2019ve seen the announcement - at least the papers have been reporting about - that we\u2019re going to shut 56 branches in Korea, we need to work with our union there in order to then make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate headcount that matches those branch closures. ","That\u2019s likely to have some residual impact on the revenues there, so I\u2019m not quite sure that we can look to the second quarter as far as having revenue growth in Korea, but once we get that second quarter repositioning behind us, I think we\u2019 then should be looking towards sequential growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","In your statements, it looked like you pushed a lot of the costs from the corporate other into the divisions, which makes sense, but I guess I was surprised you didn\u2019t push any of the $56 billion of incremental operational RWA into the divisions. Is that just a timing issue, sort of adjusting your models? Or is that corporate center going to have $124 billion of risk-weighted assets going forward?","John Gerspach ","As we exited from parallel, and you can maybe go back to some of the disclosures that we\u2019ve made on this, with the level of operational risk-weighted assets, the $288 billion of RWA that is an amount that we agreed with the Fed on. We don\u2019t have the models in place today to apportion that last $56 billion out into the business units. So it\u2019s very much model-related more than anything else. I don\u2019t envision that $56 billion staying in corporate forever, but until we get an agreed upon model approach, it\u2019s going to be difficult to apportion it out.","Operator","Thank you.

Today, we are joined by Citi's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Interim Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Lynn, you may begin.","Elizabeth Lynn","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.","Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $1.95 were 20% higher than one year ago. We increased our return on assets year-over-year to 97 basis points and generated a return on tangible common equity of 11.9% over 100 basis points better than last year.","We delivered positive operating leverage for the 11th straight quarter and improved our efficiency, while again growing loans and deposits. These results stem from strong execution of our strategy across our lines of business and show the benefits of our global franchise and product mix.","Global Consumer Banking saw a 4% revenue growth overall in constant dollars with the contribution from every region. In North America, that was led by continued strong performance in branded cards, and again, we saw encouraging momentum in deposit growth, which accelerated from the first quarter; and internationally, net income was up 25%.","In Mexico, performance was driven by good underlying revenue growth, expense management, and credit discipline. In Asia, higher deposit revenues and the recovery in investment revenues drove growth in the region.","In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall in our steadier transaction and accrual-type businesses showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry even in products like Investment Banking, where we continued to gain share.","During the quarter, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2019 CCAR submission. That means we will meet the goal set at Investor Day to return at least $60 billion in capital over three CCAR cycles.","Our $21.5 billion capital return will increase the three-year total to $62.3 billion and includes raising our dividend to $0.51 and continuing to buy back shares of common stock at roughly the same level as last year's plans. These buybacks have reduced our common shares outstanding by over 10% in the last year alone and helped drive our tangible book value per share up 10% over that same time period.","Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress towards our financial targets through client led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet, credit, and expenses.","As we look to the second half, we'll continue to take a close look at our capacity to make sure that we're rightsized for the operating environment. However, we won't change our commitment to safety and soundness and to making investments necessary to strengthen our infrastructure and control environment.","Client engagement remained strong, and we continue to enhance our capabilities to serve our clients the way they want to be served across our network. That said, there remains uncertainty with respect to the economic market and rate environment, but as we think -- I think, we've shown that our franchise can manage through these by focusing on the things that we can control.","I'll now turn it over to Mark and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark?","Mark Mason","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, net income of $4.8 billion in the second quarter grew 7% from last year, including a roughly $350 million pre-tax gain on our investment in Tradeweb, which benefited EPS by $0.12 per share. Excluding the gain, EPS of $1.83 grew by 12%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as well as a lower tax rate.","Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain, as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG. However, this growth was partially offset by lower market-sensitive revenues in ICG as well as mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our Corporate Lending portfolio.","Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio while overall credit quality remained stable.","Our return on assets was 97 basis points for the quarter, and we generated an RoTCE of 11.9%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, slightly better than our outlook. We expect our tax rate to be between 22% and 23% for the back half of the year.","In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $689 billion, as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our consumer and institutional franchises.","Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer, as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets.","And while we did benefit from the Tradeweb gain, this was largely offset by the impact of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our Corporate Lending portfolio. We delivered positive operating leverage with a 3% decline in expenses. EPS grew by 15% and our RoTCE was 11.9% for the first half.","Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The consumer business showed continued momentum in the second quarter. Revenues grew 4% with contribution from all regions while expenses were up 1% driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. For the first half of the year, excluding the Hilton gain last year, we generated 4% consumer revenue growth on flat expenses resulting in 8% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in net income.","Slide 5 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 3% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our digital capabilities and launched new products to lay the foundation for a more integrated, multi-product relationship model. Our deposit momentum continued to improve as net deposit inflows in the first half of 2019 more than doubled compared with last year. We are growing deposits with both new and existing retail bank customers in and out of our branch footprint and through both digital and traditional channels.","In digital, we further enhanced our account opening process and launched new products designed to deepen our client relationships, including relationship-based offers that leverage our proprietary banking and double cash rewards across both card and deposit products. We generated more than $1 billion in digital deposit sales in the second quarter, bringing our total for the first half to over $2 billion. Nearly two-thirds of these deposit sales were outside of our existing branch footprint and [Audio Gap] with card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us.","Results from our new digital lending product Flex Loan also continue to be positive, following its launch in January, as loan originations more than tripled from the first to the second quarter, while maintaining a strong credit profile. And we will continue to roll out new features and products in the second half of the year. So again, while many of these initiatives are still new, we feel good about our progress.","Turning now to the results of the individual businesses. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion were roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was partially offset by lower deposit spreads in commercial banking.","Average deposit growth accelerated to 2% year-over-year. And looking at deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew customer balances by 4%. Mortgage revenues were largely stable again this quarter on a sequential basis, but declined year-over-year mostly reflecting higher funding cost.","Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 8% and we continue to generate growth in interest-earning balances this quarter up about 10%. This growth in interest earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or NIR percent to 896 points this quarter.","Looking forward, we would expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads, as we look to maintain our current mix of interest earning to non-interest-earning balances.","Average loan growth improved to 2% this quarter, as we saw a smaller drag from promotional balances in the prior year. And we expect loan growth to continue to improve as we go into the back half of the year.","Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1%, driven by loan growth partially offset by higher contractual partner payments. Total expenses for North America consumer were up 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.","Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 12% year-over-year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. Card NCL rates were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and consistent with the pattern seen in prior years, we expect card NCL rates in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half of the year.","Our performance year-to-date is in line with our full NCL rate outlook for both branded cards and retail services at 300 to 325 basis points and 500 to 525 basis points respectively.","On slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Second quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%. In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 3% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year.","Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we're managing expense carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the second quarter or 3% excluding a onetime gain, mostly driven by higher deposit revenues as well as a recovery in investment revenues. We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 10% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.","In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3% reflecting a smaller LLR build relative to the prior year.","Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across the regions.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.1 billion were down 1%.","Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 4% as reported and 7% in constant dollars with growth in deposits, transaction volumes and trade spreads reflecting continued strong client engagement.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 10% from last year, while outperforming the market wallet. The decline was primarily driven by a strong prior year performance in M&A, partially offset by continued strength in debt underwriting.","Private Bank revenues of $866 million were up 2%, reflecting growth with both new and existing clients, which drove higher lending, deposits, and AUM volumes, partially offset by spread compression. And Corporate Lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in Securities Services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and investor client activity has remained muted.","Excluding Tradeweb, Fixed Income revenues declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting the challenging trading environment particularly in rates. Equities revenues were down 9% reflecting lower client activity in cash equities and prime brokerage, partially offset by strong corporate client activity in derivatives. And Security Services revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and 7% in constant dollars, reflecting higher rates as well as higher client activity.","Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments in volume-driven growth. And cost of credit was $103 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio. Credit quality remained stable and total non-accrual loans declined both sequential -- sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.","Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and Securities Services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive business.","We're focused on continuing to build upon the strength that we're seeing in our network businesses by making it easier for our large multi-national clients to do more business around the world. We are investing in technology to further digitize and improve our on-boarding processes, enhance our client-facing platforms, and roll out new capabilities across the franchise as we support the growth in cross-border flows that we are seeing with our multi-national clients, and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives going forward.","Slide 9 shows results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $532 million increased 1% from last year, as higher treasury revenues and gains were largely offset by the wind-down of legacy assets.","Expenses were down 20%, mostly reflecting the wind-down and the pretax income was $73 million this quarter, somewhat better than our prior outlook. Looking ahead, we would still expect a modest pretax quarterly loss in Corporate\/Other for the remainder of 2019.","Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of nearly $12 billion this quarter grew by roughly $450 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as higher trading-related NIR, along with the absence of the FDIC surcharge.","On a sequential basis, net interest revenue grew by roughly $230 million, largely reflecting higher trading-related NIR, along with one additional day in the quarter. However, net interest margin declined five basis points sequentially, as the benefit of our revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter. In the first half of 2019, our net interest revenue grew by 6%, or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as a reminder, when we set our NIR outlook for 2019 back in January, we were assuming one U.S. rate increase in mid-2019, but the expected benefit of the rate hike had been relatively small. As of last quarter, we had taken that rate hike out of our assumptions. And now we recognize that we may begin to see rate cuts as early as later this month, but keep in mind that the estimated impact of each rate cut remains relatively small.","We continue to estimate that each 25 basis point cut in U.S. rates impacts revenues by roughly $50 million on a quarterly basis, but, of course, this will depend on the competitive environment for deposits and other factors. So, the rate environment continues to evolve, but we are managing our rate sensitivity carefully, and we continue to expect to generate net interest revenue growth this year of about 4% in constant dollars, which equates to roughly $2 billion of growth as we've discussed on previous earnings calls.","Turning to non-interest revenue. On a full year basis, we continue to expect total non-interest revenue to come in roughly flat to the prior year. In the first half of 2019, non-interest revenue declined by close to $900 million, all of which you saw in the first quarter.","This decline was mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the prior year, as well as a very strong prior year comparison in equities in the first quarter, along with the drag from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges. In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year.","Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018 when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico. However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year.","On slide 11, we show our capital -- we show our key capital metrics. In the second quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 10% year-over-year to $67.64, driven by net income and a lower share count, and our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $4.6 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.","To conclude, while the revenue environment has proved challenging for some of our businesses, we make continued progress in the first half of 2019. From a revenue perspective, we are seeing solid momentum across the consumer franchise and continued growth in our accrual businesses in ICG. And, while we've seen pressure in some of our market sensitive businesses, results have generally reflected the broader industry. We continue to believe, we can generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019, driven by continued growth in net interest revenue and more stable trends in non-interest revenue versus 2018.","On the expense side, our productivity savings have exceeded our incremental investments by roughly $300 million so far this year, putting us on track to achieve the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million in incremental net savings, we had expected for full year 2019. Expenses were down year-over-year in the first half, and we believe that was prudent given the revenue headwinds we faced.","Looking ahead, we will maintain this expense discipline relative to the revenue environment, while continuing to make essential investments in the franchise, including investments in infrastructure and controls, but we do expect expenses to be lower on a sequential basis from the first half to the second half of the year. And while the operating environment is uncertain, we will continue to look to all of our return levers with a continued focus on our full year RoTCE target of 12% for 2019.","Before we go into Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook for the third quarter specifically. In ICG, we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network and markets and investment banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment. On the consumer side, in North America, solid revenue growth should continue, driven by U.S. Branded Cards.","In Asia, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth. And in Mexico, as I just mentioned, we'll be comparing to the third quarter last year, which included a gain on the sale of our asset management business. On an underlying basis, similar to the results seen so far this year, revenue growth will likely remain somewhat muted, although we expect continued strong growth in pre-tax earnings. For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning, Mark.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","John McDonald","I wanted to ask about the -- how are you doing? I wanted to ask about the RoTCE goal. So 12% goal for 2019, you are on the doorstep so far the first half of 11.9%. As we think about levers to kind of keep that up in the second half and push over the goal line to get above 12% for the year, second half often has not as strong capital markets, obviously, haven't been so good this quarter -- so far this year. So just -- what are the things to think about puts and takes for the second half that could get you over that 12% for the year?","Mark Mason","Thank you. So, 12% remains the target for 2019. As you heard Mike mention, you heard me mention, we're obviously in an uncertain environment. The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances.","And we'd expect that revenue growth to continue through the balance of the year. You heard me mention, the international franchises which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there's muted growth to have -- to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth particularly in the case of Latin America. So those will be two positive drivers I would point to.","I obviously point to our accrual businesses and transaction businesses on the ICG side, 7% growth in both Securities Services and GTS this quarter. We'd expect continued growth from those businesses.","And on the expense side, we talked to -- or I talked to really being on the high end of those productivity savings outweighing investments. And I would expect to certainly come in with that $600 million side of the range that we've talked to there.","The big area where the uncertainty in the environment you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market sensitive business. It plays out through the trading that you see on the fixed income and equities.","It plays out through investment banking. It impacts corporate sentiment, and those things as you would imagine are difficult to predict. We obviously feel good about the client dialogue that we've had, but that's -- those are the factors that are a bit harder to manage. And when we see that softness what you saw in the first half is that we pulled levers that we could pull responsibly.","And you should expect that we would continue to do that in the back half without compromising two things. One, the investments required to continue to grow the strong parts of the franchise; and two, infrastructure and controls. And those two things we think are critical to the long-term sustainability of the franchise.","Now, we'll continue to manage credit very carefully. You saw our tax rate come in a little bit lower this quarter. We'll continue to do work around what we can do to get the tax rate as low as we responsibly can get it, and you've seen us actually being more on the capital side.","So that combination of things, we think is helpful in obviously trying to get to that target of the 12%. There are -- there is some unpredictability to that, particularly on the market side. And to the extent that that plays out more severely than forecasted, we would expect to be in and around the range of 12%.","John McDonald","I guess also you did say \u2013 you\u2019d expect you\u2019re going to have lower card losses in the second half versus the first and that should help? Is there any frontloading of marketing or any other expense kind of frontloading and investment frontloading that you have ?","Mark Mason","Yeah. I mean, when you look at the profitability just in general on the consumer business, it does tend to skew towards the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend. We also and I mentioned this in the last call, we also pulled forward some of the repositioning that we were looking to do as we reorganized around different parts of the franchise. And so, savings that we were expecting kind of later in 2020, we can -- we'll see some of that benefit play out through the back half of 2019. So, there are those things around levers and actions that we took in the first half that not only helped the first half, but have the potential to help us in the second half as well.","John McDonald","Okay. And just last thing for me on that note. You're still looking ahead towards a goal of 13.5% for next year?","Mark Mason","Yes, 13.5% remains the target for next year. Just to -- obviously, again, I'll point back to the environment that we're in; we'll see how the environment plays out. We'll see how the market reacts to rate reductions. Obviously, the activity we saw last week in the way of a market reaction was pretty favorable to have a more certainty around the direction of rates.","But we'll see how those -- some of those things play out and it does remain the target, and if we have to identify additional levers to try and pull to get there, we will. But as we stand here today, that 13.5% remains our target for 2020.","John McDonald","Great. Thanks.","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thank you very much.","Mark Mason","Hi, Glen.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. Question on the net interest income trends. So, if you look at the 12% decline in non-interest bearing deposits and the 9% increase in interest-bearing deposits and then also the seven basis point rise in deposit costs sequentially and then the drop in loan yields, those trends combined, while not surprising, you would think from the outside would be a more negative tone on NII, but I think your guide was actually pretty good.","Are there offsets that we don't see end or are some of those trends like the tail end of things that have been in motion and they actually get better over the next couple of quarters?","Mark Mason","Yes. So, in terms of the net interest revenue, we're obviously at about $1.3 billion of net interest revenue with a strong Q1 about $450 million in Q2. And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in at this point not only the shift that you mentioned from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there.","And so as we look at -- and look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side, and we look at the end of the deposit growth that we're seeing particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR.","Notwithstanding that there are other factors that come into play, not the least of which is how many additional cards play out through the balance of the year. But as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about that. The bigger driver -- the biggest driver I think would be as I mentioned continued growth on the branded card side, continued growth in the accrual businesses. Those are going to be the larger factors that play through the back half of the year.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe a little more color on the loan -- on the loan yield side coming down, I'm assuming that is LIBOR-based loans. And the follow-up I have on that is, who makes the call on those loans, meaning LIBOR-based versus prime-based? Is it you, or is it client-led? I'm just curious on how to think about that as we go-forward. It looks like LIBOR adjusted but prime didn\u2019t, obviously.","Mike Corbat","Yeah. So, we've had -- we certainly saw some revenue pressure on the corporate lending book. That was a combination of, kind of, the spread compression in addition to some hedging cost and that certainly played through here.","In terms of the pricing of the loan, that is -- both a by-product of what we're seeing in the market, on the way of competition from a pricing point of view and obviously -- and the funding cost that we have. I think, we -- what we've tried to be diligent about is where there're opportunities to both serve the client and not necessarily tie-up the balance sheet, we've taken advantage of those opportunities, particularly in our trading -- our trade lending activity, so that we're not bringing on economic position that -- or positions that are uneconomical.","We continue to see pressure from a pricing point of view in Asia. And so, you've seen our Asia loans come down just because the combination of the economics not making sense again, as well as just really slowing demand, given what's going on with trade.","And so, there is pressure from a spread point of view. We do have a view towards pricing that not only considers our own internal funding, but also the client demand and the competitive landscape and that combination of factors is what plays out through the year.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Really appreciated. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Jim.","Mark Mason","Hi, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Hi. Maybe just following up on Glenn's question, just to zero in on deposits a little bit. Interest-bearing deposit rates paid was up 7 basis points without any kind of a hike. Is that just a mix shift? You mentioned, I think, it looked like Asia deposits were up. I would imagine they're higher rates. Just trying to figure out, is there domestic pressure on rates paid, or is that just mix?","Mark Mason","Yeah. So, there is some mix shift. I mean, there is some shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing.","Jim Mitchell","That would affect the rates paid on interest-bearing?","Mark Mason","Yeah. That's right. And then -- so the other dynamic is, in fact, what we're seeing -- there are two things. One, what we see on the market from a competitive point of view; two, there tends to be a lag effect from the betas that played through on the retail side. And then three, as we've been growing some of the U.S. deposits that I mentioned earlier, some of that has been growth out of our markets, but with high \u2013 so tied with high yield savings account type product.","Jim Mitchell","So, would you expect that to continue to creep higher a little bit, or start to stabilize?","Mark Mason","It kind of depends on kind of what happens in the broader rate environment. We obviously are talking about rate cuts now and that ultimately over time would have an impact. I think, the strategic way that I tend to look at it is, these deposits -- the deposit activity that we have with clients is really geared towards the broader relationship that we have with them as you know. And so, we had a lot of good deposit growth on the TPS side. That's around the broader solutions that we talked to and worked with those clients around.","The deposit growth we're seeing on the consumer side is really about the demonstrating the digital capability that we have and really broadening the relationship we have with them.","So, yes, there is some pricing pressure. The rate movement in the future will certainly have an impact on how much more or less of that plays through, but we do think we're making progress again for the broader strategic objectives.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And a clarification for the $2 billion in NII growth this year. Are you assuming now a rate cut in that number? Or I'm not sure if I heard you say that?","Mark Mason","We're assuming one rate cut in that number.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. That's very helpful. And then\u2026","Mark Mason","Towards the back half of the year.","Jim Mitchell","Right. And just one question on TTS and trade finance, you mentioned spreads being wider in trades, so trade war helping you a little bit? Or have you seen a slowdown? Certainly trade flow seemed to have slowed. How do we think about that you seem pretty confident in the growth in that business? Or how you\u2019re thinking about the dynamics there?","Mike Corbat","I think from a trade perspective, I would say -- I don't want to say BAU, the business activity remains fairly strong. I think we've seen some trade routes shifting. The example we gave as oppose to soy from the U.S. soy from Brazil et cetera, so trade route shifting, I think our clients are kind of very engaged around kind of steady and trying to stay ahead of that. So, I don't think, we'd speak to any kind of slowdown as of yet, but clearly people paying a lot of attention to it.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","So you guys are executing on the capital deployment strategy you laid out a couple of years ago and to be fair, I think there was some debate or concern whether you could execute on that and you are. But now you're sitting here, you performed very well in DFAST. Some of your peers surprised the market and delivered more than expected. And it seems like your position to do even more than what you had promised couple of years ago and just wondering your thoughts on whether you can do it and the timing and how you approach it?","Mark Mason","Yeah. So as you mentioned, we -- back at Investor Day, we talked about $60 billion plus over the three-year cycle. We were going to exceed that. We just have $21.5 billion over the four quarters covered by this 2019 cycle. As you know we have an objective of trying to, obviously, generate the highest return and return is -- as much capital as we can to our shareholders. We currently manage to a CET1 target of 11.5% net that obviously has buffers in it for some of the uncertainty that's still out there, whether the proposals like SCB and -- or other things that impact of the variability of capital.","As we get greater clarity on those things, we will obviously continue to kind of look at that, but that remains the target going forward. We've got -- we're still running at 11.9% CET1 ratio. So subject to growth needs, we will always be looking at how we ensure that we run that more tightly to that target of 11.5%. And the way we think about the return of capital distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to towards the end of the year will be around how much capital we generate just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow.","And so, we certainly have the objective of continuing to return as much as it makes good sense given the growth opportunities for the franchise. If you look back over the three-year cycle, we've returned on average about 121% of our net income available to common. So we feel pretty good about that percentage albeit, we started at a higher CET1 ratio years ago.","Matt O'Connor","And can you just remind us as we think about the 11.5% target, what are some of the areas of clarity that you're looking for in terms of reevaluating that? You obviously got some comments from the Fed in recent weeks. But it seems like the stress test might be little bit easier than feared as they bring in the stress capital buffer and -- what are some other things specifically that you're looking for to potentially bring that down?","Mark Mason","Yes. So, look they are -- you just mentioned one with the SCB that's one of the proposals that's still out there. We just got as you mentioned some clarity about what to see how that factors in. There are number of other proposals that are still outstanding.","And the dialogue that we've heard from regulators is largely around ensuring that those things that there is understanding, how those things will work in aggregate in terms of how they impact the amount of capital that institutional out the whole, whether that's additional clarity on how to think about G-SIB.","We obviously have C-CIL that will come into play in early 2020, but all of those factors are important. We've heard commentary around greater clarity or transparency as part of the CCAR process. We obviously support rate of transparency. We think it'll help through and move some of the variability in capital planning.","So as that starts to kind of come -- continue to come into the fold that will be important to how we think about this. So those are just a couple of examples.","Mike Corbat","And I think this really, Mark. When we think about the 4.5, plus to 3, plus the 3, what's in some ways on the table is the management buffer, the 100 basis points. And as you described, as we look at G-SIB and C-CIL and kind of all these things coming together, whether or not there's an opportunity to reexamine that or not.","Matt O'Connor","And then just lastly to bring it all together like as you think about some of these moving pieces, do you think you\u2019ll have clarity before the next CCAR cycle that might motivate you to resubmit? Or is it more helping that clarity with the next cycle on these factors?","Mark Mason","Yeah. Its -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years. And so we just really have to see how much additional clarity we get over the coming months and we'll figure that out as time progresses.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions; first, Mark, I just wanted to clarify the NII guide. So I think you mentioned, you're still on track for $2 billion increase this year versus last year of that -- and 4%. That does imply by my calculations that second half \u2013 the quarterly run rate does continue to ratchet up versus the first half, something like 12.1, 12.2. Is that -- I just want to clarify that's right and if that's including a rate cut being baked into that outlook?","Mark Mason","Yes. So what we are still targeting and on-track for $2 billion for the full year as I've stated. We do have one rate hike that we're assuming.","Mike Corbat","Rate cut.","Mark Mason","Sorry. Rate cut that we're assuming, excuse me. Rate cut that we're assuming on the -- in the back half of the year. Obviously, if that happens sooner, happens in July that would have an impact on the NIR forecast that we have and candidly, if there is more than one rate cut that would have additional impact and so those are the factors. There obviously are other factors that come into play, but that is -- and that is assuming obviously a change in the U.S. rates. So, -- but we are still targeting the $2 billion recognizing there's some risk there.","Saul Martinez","Got it. But given just the $50 million impact for 20 -- for the quarter from 20 to 25 basis points of cut, presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half?","Mark Mason","Yes. I think the broader issue is the uncertainty that Mike and I have referenced that's just out there. And so if we just isolated this to two interest rate cuts in the scheme of a $47 billion NIR line, I mean, you're absolutely -- you're right. But the reality is that, it's the broader uncertainty that's out there that's impacting the industry. And while that goes through the market-sensitive revenues and just kind of cooperate sentiment more broadly.","Saul Martinez","Was there -- in the past you've broken out this slide on Page 10, where you break out the accrual versus legacy versus trading. Is there a reason why you're not doing that this time around?","Mark Mason","Yes. Just -- I mean, as we kind of exited the holdings and started to kind of wind down those legacy businesses that became less of a significant variable as you look at these total revenues, it was probably 5% of the aggregate revenues in the first quarter, and so it just wasn't as -- it wasn't on a constant-dollar basis. It's just wasn't as meaningful, and so we moved towards simplifying it with both the legacy breakout as well as the trading NIR breakout.","Saul Martinez","Okay. And one final one from me, a large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America consumer comes from right-sizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposits, the inflows, the digital strategies, tapping your cards network or your cards clients.","But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads is likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking. In a tougher rate environment, can you right-size profitability? Or how much more difficult is it to right-size the profitability of your retail banking business, if the Fed continues to cut?","Mark Mason","Yes. I'd make two points. One is as I think about the back half of 2019 and even 2020 for that matter, I think that the work that we've done in branded cards is going to be a meaningful contributor, or continue to be a meaningful contributor to the revenue performance that we see in consumer North America.","The North America retail bank, as you mentioned, we had one's at a high efficiency rate at this point. We are seeing good traction as it relates to deposits increasing, but what -- again, what that's really about for us is, how we deepen the relationships and kind of broaden the penetration of those products and services into our card customer base. And so, over time, I think it's going to be more challenging to look at just the retail banking portion of that we breakout in income, because of that broader client strategy. And so, I think -- so, I think that's kind of how we thought about it.","That said, I mentioned, kind of, repositioning that we have taken in the first quarter that we've taken a bit of that in the second quarter. That's largely around the reorganization to support that strategy and moving from our product siloed-type of business model to one that is more geared towards the client and we think that that will help. That, obviously, will help the margins as we continue to execute against the strategy.","Saul Martinez","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. I have one very short-term question and one very long-term question. The very short-term question relates to -- what was the dollar amount of the mark-to-market hedge losses? You said that, roughly offset Tradeweb, or was a much bigger number than what was in the press release? So what was that number?","Mark Mason","So the -- in the quarter, the mark-to-market loss -- loan losses were -- losses on loan hedges were $75 million. For the half is what I was talking about. For the half, the number was about $306 million. So about $231 million in the first quarter. And so that's the number.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And then the longer term question is, how much runway do you have left with technology to improve Citigroup's efficiency? Mark, when you mentioned the levers that helped meet your targets, the RoTCE target of 12%. You didn't mention technology, yet you mentioned the $300 million spread between the savings from the investments over the new investment level. So, what's the runway left kind of short, medium and long-term? Thanks.","Mark Mason","In that $500 million to $600 million for the year, the $300 million that we've done year-to-date, as it relates to productivity, are the benefits of the technology investments that we've been making. So some portion of those savings is a by-product of technology investments.","We continue -- we see those technology benefits in the digital capabilities that we built-out and how that plays out in a lower cost to not only acquire, but lower cost to service the clients. You see things like the use of eStatements going up. We see things like volumes into call centers going down. All of those things are benefits that are generated as a by-product of technology investments that we've made.","We expect a similar level of productivity sales in 2020. We do continue to invest in technology. In fact, what you heard me mention earlier in terms of one of the protected areas being infrastructure and control, they are coupled with the different ways to look at that protected area as we invest in technology around our infrastructure and improve the data quality that we have and things of that sort, not only does it help us run a safer and more sound organization, but it also arms us with information sooner to enable us to react and serve our clients more quickly.","And so, yes, the answer is yes. We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that are referenced both in 2019 and 2020 and likely beyond and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time.","Mike Corbat","Mike, I think if you go to Page 21 in the deck, you can see, we put in there some different drivers and metrics, and I think from -- the way I think about it is, today we really run the combination of an analog and a digital bank. And the faster we can continue to drive digital adoption mobile usage, we know that\u2019s cheaper. It's significantly cheaper when we\u2019re solving issues on your phone, where we're solving issues away from physical interaction or voice and again, you can see, we've got roughly 30 million active digital users. We've got 20 million active mobile users between North America and international. And you can look at the year-over-year growth rates, I think probably amongst the highest in the industry. And so, we're on this journey. And, obviously, the investments that we can make to switch those over, we think yields a -- yield quite high returns.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up. Mark, you reaffirmed the guidance for RoTCE for this year and the next. And Mike, do you also reaffirm that guidance, I certainly do?","Mike Corbat","Absolutely.","Mike Mayo","So, Citi -- just predates you missed a lot of targets this decade as we approach the end of the decade and consensus does not expect you to reach those targets and look, we have buy on the stock. We haven\u2019t always had a buy on the stock. And we don\u2019t even have you reaching those targets. So, where do you think the disconnect is? You think that Citi is going to get 13.5% RoTCE next year and you are hard-pressed upon too many other people who agree with you. Assuming we don't have a recession or anything like that, where do you think the market is wrong?","Mark Mason","Now, let me try to answer that in a couple of ways. First, let me go back to 2019 for a second, because both Mike and I have said that the 12% remains the target for 2019. It absolutely does. You can also look at the first half of the year or the fourth quarter of last year and witness strength in the franchise, on the consumer side, on your core side of the business, but you can also witness the impact of the environment that we're in and the uncertainty around that.","Despite that uncertainty, we've gotten to 11.9% in the first half through pulling a number of levers and we would expect to continue to pull those levers into the back half of this year to the extent that that uncertainty increases, or there is more significant reaction from the market to the uncertainty, we'll of course look and work to find additional levers, but at some point that becomes challenged, in terms of getting to that 12% just given things we want to protect in this franchise. And I believe that even if it were to become challenged that we'd end up in a range around that 12% and that is what we are working towards that target that 12% target.","In terms of 2020 and the 13.5% target that we have for 2020 and the disconnect, I mean, we've talked about the disconnect in the past and it moves around as you would know very well.","But it's ranged from being a little bit of difference of views on the topline which I think we've started to narrow some of that gap, given the performance we've been able to demonstrate through the first half of the year, again in those strong areas. There's also been less of a disconnect on the expense line as I've given I think a little bit more specificity around the guidance there.","There's been a cost of credit difference of use in the past and again we feel pretty good about our cost of credit outlook, but we obviously recognize that where we are in this cycle. There's been obviously tax work that we continue to do and we'll continue to do and I gave some additional view on that.","We've done well on capital than we originally talked about. And still it's those drivers and levers that we will continue to pull through the balance of this year. We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and we'll go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it.","Mike Corbat","And Mike, the way I think about it simplistically is, we're going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers with the exception of two things. One is, we are going to continue to make the investments that are necessary to keep our business competitive.","You can see a lot of things going on around this and I think around our franchises in consumer or our institutional business. As an example, in TTS or security services, we think we just got to make those investments to stay competitive. And the second thing is around us is our commitment to our shareholders and our regulators to make sure that we're making the investments in terms of safety and soundness. And so, we won't put those at risk but everything else is on the table.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hey, good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start-off with the question on the FICC business. You cited some of the pressures within FICC and rates in particular. Your business is already been somewhat unique just given the higher contributions from TTS and particularly with non-financial corporate.","I think that's more than 30% of your total revenue there. I'm wondering whether you're seeing greater resiliency on that side of the business which would suggest maybe even more pronounced pressure within institutional.","Mark Mason","So I guess what I'd say is obviously our fixed income revenues for the quarter were down about 4% if you exclude the gain from Tradeweb. I think when you look at what transpired in the quarter, there was a fair amount of volatility around rates and rate movement and what we saw was that play out particularly around the investor client base that we have. So, to the point we made before, we continue to see stable cooperate client activity, particularly in rates and currencies, where there's a strong linkage to our broader franchise and in particular TTS. But we did see decreased activity with our investor clients given all of the macro uncertainty that I've mentioned now a couple of times.","Many of the investor clients remain on the sidelines. And frankly, it was the speed and the magnitude of the rate movements that created a challenging marketing -- market environment and made it difficult to monetize client flows.","On the equity side, well, you didn't ask about equity. But on the equity side, I mean, the trade war had similar or trade discussions and war had a similar impact that kind of flows through particularly again with investor clients, I mentioned earlier, impacting both cash equities and prime brokerage, but we did see again, corporal client activity even in equities kind of hold up nicely playing out to equity derivatives.","Mike Corbat","And the way I would say Mark is I think is -- engagement is high, engagement is very good.","Mark Mason","Yes.","Mike Corbat","But I think right now the challenges -- and maybe it's the opportunity -- in that we're clearly pivoting from an environment where we had predicted or thought, or had been built-in rising rates to at this point rates going lower. And I think from our perspective, we don't believe that the market has made that full adjustment, and there's probably some terms that's got to come as portfolio set-up for that potential lower rate environment.","The question is when will that come and to what degree will that come, will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not positioned where they need to be fully.","Mark Mason","And again, to that point, just last week when there appeared to be some signs of greater clarity on the move in rate, the reduction in rates and the timing of that. The equity markets responded very, very favorably to that. And so to your point Mike, I think clarity in direction should yield greater confidence and perhaps a more of a risk on mentality as it relates to the markets.","Steven Chubak","Very helpful color. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up for me on ICG credit, you guided to -- or indicate some normalization of credit trends, but the charge-off rate there is quite low at eight basis points. I'm just wondering is it fair for us to extrapolate that eight basis point loss rate as indicative of what you guys view as normalized.","And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view?","Mark Mason","Yes. I mean, again, when you think about our Corporate Lending book and the quality of our exposure, the multi-national clients that we cover, the 83% of it being investment grade type exposure. Historically, we've had loss rates that have been low in the way of number of basis points five to six basis points historically, and yes, we are starting to see some normalization of that.","I think the quarter cost of credit, the $103 million is reflective of that coming out -- coming out of last year and representative I think of what we've talked to in the way of what to -- to look to see in the way of normalization. And so, I think, it's a by-product of the quality of the book that we have and the nature of the activity that we do in lending.","Steven Chubak","Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks a lot. Just a follow-up on the credit side. Mark, you pointed out that the -- on the consumer side of credit that things have also kind of just gone according to plan. You've maintained that guide. At what point do you see the end of the light in terms of the seasoning? Meaning, how long do you think you can kind of stay in this very benign zone for the card side, presuming that the economy stays in relatively good form? Any reason to see any change to that, I guess, is the question?","Mark Mason","Yes. I mean, not at this stage. I mean, it\u2019s -- we gave kind of medium term guidance, if you will, and we've talked about those ranges of 300 to 325, 500 to 525. Again, certainly through the balance of this year, we expect to end up inside of that range. We look at probably all the things that would be obvious to folks and then some.","So, if you look at just on the macro front, we're obviously looking and watching closely the inverted yield curve and what that has meant historically. But when we look at that juxtaposed against the internal metrics that we use, whether that would be card usage patterns or utilization or payment rates or the percentage of customers making minimum payments. I mean, thus far those indicators have all remained broadly stable. And so, I don't see any cause at this point for material concern.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then, the tax rate you mentioned 22%, 23% in the back half and you've also talked about there potentially being some levers there. Can you help us understand, like, does that mean that over time you have the chance to still take the tax rate lower as you look into 2020 and as part of your \u2013 that plan for the RoTCE improvement?","Mark Mason","We're constantly looking at it and trying to identify opportunities, looking at obviously where we book business and client demands around that and where there are opportunities to do that. But at this point, I'm not taking down the guidance. I'm just pointing out, perhaps, the obvious, which is that, it's one of the levers that we continue to push on and explore.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Last one, just on the deposit cost side, with the potential rates turning and some non-U.S. central banks already cutting, what's the lag effect here in terms of this quarter? The deposit costs were up 7 basis points. What's the rate of change that you need to see before you can see a leveling out of the basis point increases that we see on deposit cost side? Thanks Mark.","Mark Mason","Yes. So it's -- I guess, it's a -- what we've seen during the rate rise or increases where that the -- abate is on the corporate side and the commercial side have kind of tick-up a lot faster and there tends to be a lag on the retail consumer side. And as things turn, I would expect, to some extent, similar type of direction, notwithstanding that the retail deposit side still has that lag to it and there are other factors such as the competitive landscape that's out there for deposit.","And so, it's a little bit hard, kind of, pinpoint exactly when that stabilizes, just given all of those factors, but we're obviously managing it closing and managing it in the context of the broader strategy that I referenced a couple of times now.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions. Just on the deposit business, a follow-up there. Could you give us a sense, I think you mentioned at the beginning, I recall that you had a $2 billion increase in deposits that was from the digital efforts you've got, two-thirds outside your footprint and half of the $2 billion coming from folks that have your card, but didn't have a banking relationship with you. Could you just give us a sense of how that was relative to expectations and what you think the major drivers were for generating that growth speaking to rate versus marketing versus any other factors that you want to add?","Mark Mason","Yeah. So, one I would say that is in line with what we were expecting in the way of deposit performance through the digital sales channel. We have seen, kind of, broadly just good activity with our consumer retail clients not just with the net deposits, but also retaining deposits as they shift into AUMs. And so -- and as clients start to make investments and so the flow levels have been very good if you include both AUMs and the deposits.","I would say, we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year. It is a combination of -- and if you think about our strategy again to target card customers, a good portion of the deposit growth that we achieved were outside of our six markets and with our card customers who did not have a retail banking relationship. It's a byproduct I would say of not only rates, so there was some portion that is tied to the high yield savings account. Although that -- even that does demonstrate the power of the model, because we know these customers and they're not -- it's not a cannibalization of what we gather inside of our market. But it's also a byproduct of the work we've been doing around creating a value proposition and understanding, which of our clients are likely to respond to what rewards.","And so you heard me mention banking points and double cash rewards. Those were part of the offerings to clients to join us in terms of the retail banking products that we offer in exchange for -- are there more ThankYou Points or more benefits that accrue from the double cash reward.","So, it is a combination of marketing, targeted marketing in terms of knowing the customers, we want to go after and what they're likely to respond to. Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth.","Betsy Graseck","And then, I know you mentioned that the NIM came under a little bit of pressure as you had significant increase in deposit growth and the tie-in question here is, is there anything you need to see from these customers? Is there like -- do they need to keep their deposits with you for certain amount of time before you're able to take some duration with these deposits on the asset side? Or should we anticipate that as you're growing your new deposits here and out of footprint does that gets reinvested in the front end of the curve?","Mark Mason","Yeah. So, I mean obviously there is LCR treatment for different types of deposits. These are largely time deposits that we've been bringing in. I think that we would expect that to -- like I said, expect that to continue down the path. There's no reason for us to feel us though the -- these are kind of short term in nature or anything of that sort.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. But they be match funded or match invested I should say?","Mark Mason","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just two other questions; one on the TTS business, could you give us a sense as how you expect the business operates or performs in a declining interest rate environment? If we look at the forward curve, how should we expect TSS to behave?","And then you mentioned some strong pipeline with initiatives for the client\u2019s maybe you could speak to that? And I'm kind of interested in understanding what you're planning on vis-\u00e0-vis the Libra announcement that came out of Facebook.","Now I know Libra seems like it's more a personal related, but there is a C2B and B2B element with that. So I wanted to understand, what your plans are? My basic question is why do we need Libra? It seems like you might have what companies need, so maybe you could speak to that a little bit? Thanks.","Mark Mason","Yes. I guess, I'll start and then Mike may want to chime in. So, just in terms of the TTS business, we obviously have seen very strong growth in the TTS business over the past number of years and quarters and even this quarter with 7% growth, which is probably a little bit lower than what we've seen in prior years and just as the rate increases have started to become fewer and now we move into a rate -- a likely rate reduction.","The impact to TTS is factored into at least the estimate that I gave you in terms of the impact of a 25 basis point reduction. It obviously would have an impact on the growth rate. But I would say that the majority of the growth rate that we've experienced in our TTS business is not tied towards -- not tied to the interest rate.","But instead tied towards growth that we've had in both with multinational clients that are large and that we've been with for a long time, but also new emerging clients as they've entered into new markets, new countries and we've been there to assist them with how they kind of grow their businesses and operations in those new environments where whether it be working capital or supply chain needs that they've had. And so I would expect to see continued growth in TTS albeit at a slower pace in light of the rate environment.","But again, our relationship with our clients are broader than just us taking their cash and holding their cash and we're offering them solutions that are a lot broader than just the rate that we pay them for cash.","The other piece that I'd mentioned is that, we have been and will continue to invest in technology around our TTS franchise. It is obviously a very competitive space, but it's one where we had a strong position for a long time. It's been nicely growing. It's very efficient. It's high-returning.","We're nicely entrenched with many of our customers and we've got to continue to invest in the high end experience and enabling faster cross-border activity for those client. And so good growth, I expect to see continued growth, requires investment, we're in front of that investment to stay competitive, and we will continue to do so. And I'll let Mike kind of comment on some of the other pieces you mentioned.","Mike Corbat","Thanks. Mark, I would just to -- going back to TTS for one second, that's the operating in a declining rate environment, it\u2019s nothing new, it certainly not new in the U.S. And if you look at our TTS business operating around the world many, many jurisdictions we operate, we've been in declining rate environments for a period of time, and I think the work that team is done, moving from interest rate sensitive to more fee-driven types of relationships has been helpful in that.","On your question pertaining to what's going on from a technology perspective and in this case Libra in particular. One is, I am not -- we are not dismissive at all of this. We look at them. We study them.","As we've said, we were not -- are not part of the inaugural group. I read the white paper several times at this point in time. And again, I look and there's I think some redeeming or there's some qualitative aspects that are appealing, and I think there's others that might raise some questions.","And I think the way we think about it is that the market is moving and likely moving quickly towards 24\/7, real-time frictionless, ubiquitous global money movements and payments, and that's just the reality and that's going to happen, and I think we're pretty well-positioned around that.","As I think of things like Libra not a question of if, it's when the digital currency comes, it's a question is that currency one that kind of operates as a consortium, or is it a Federal Reserve, or is it a central bank-backed type currency?","And I think we're preparing for a world with both of those were consumers, businesses are going to have flexibility in terms of their choices, of what they choose to use, and our goal objective and mandate really is to be there with the system that's got the capacity to operate across all of those.","Betsy Graseck","So, a lot of times big-tackled highlight friction in the system and opportunities they have to cut friction out, meaning take out fee rates of legacy businesses. Could you speak to how you're thinking about that? Because I think some people might view you as a legacy business with a margin that can be taken out. How do you answer that kind of question?","Mike Corbat","Yes. Betsy, I'd probably break our businesses into two components, I'd break it into consumer business and institutional payments business. I think in the consumer business, it's clear that interchange is an example is a friction that has existed for a period of time, and as we've seen elsewhere in the world, we're likely to continue to come down.","And so -- and I think that's one reason, why you'd seen the disruptors or the innovators so focused on consumer versus institutional payments, because on the institutional side, there's really not much money in the pure movement of money. It's in the operation of the operating account, where yes, you do get some flow. But by the way, Libra has flow and in their consumer as I've read, they're actually not paying. That's where the partners are receiving their income.","There are frictions in foreign exchange. There are frictions in terms of rates and other things that we combine with that, but you got to have the back-end that can provide those services in today's age, not only provide them, but provide them in a real-time upscale way.","So, again, not dismissive, but on the institutional side of things that from a payments perspective, you got to have the full package. It's not just the movement of money is not the answer in there. And so again, not dismissive, but -- and that's why the investments in areas like TTS are so important that we're continuing to build-out the front-end. We're continuing to take pain points out and whether those frictions are in the forms of fees or money, or probably to our customers benefit, even more so in the form of on-boarding all the frictions that come in terms of account opening and making sure that we're investing in BSA and AML and those other pieces, such that we can continue to distinguish ourselves with our clients as the place to go.","Betsy Graseck","Looks great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. And Erika, your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Hi. Can hear me now?","Mike Corbat","Yes. Good morning","Erika Najarian ","Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for answering the questions on your RoTCE targets. Maybe asking it a different way. The market seems to be now expecting three rate cuts between now and the end of 2020. I think previously you've set an efficiency goal of 53% for 2020, with 175 basis points of improvement in 2019 and 225 in 2020.","And I'm wondering if we do get three rate cuts and corporate activity remains at current levels, is there enough productivity savings that you can identify to reiterate the efficiency targets as well?","Mark Mason","Yeah. Look, I mean, we -- obviously, the volatility around rate movement has been pretty significant over the past couple of quarters from us -- from an increase to now a reduction and possibly three reductions. And so, if we had significant moves in rates, we can kind of do the math as to what the implications would be.","I think we'd also have to make some assumptions around those other factors that are in the environment and what happens with those, whether it's trade and the tariffs, et cetera, and whether we'd really have a fulsome answer in terms of what implications would be on achieving the 13.5%, and then being able to ascertain what levers we'd be able to pull.","So, it's a difficult question to answer, as I sit here today as to whether -- which levers and how much of those levers we'd be able to pull while protecting the things that Mike and I have referenced and still hitting a 13.5%. I think to some extent, I want to see how dispersed rate cut plays out and what the implications are for additional rate cuts. Again, we could very well see, as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to, kind of, wait and see how some of that plays out.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yeah. Morning.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So a quick question on branded cards. You said, you expect to maintain the current mix between the full rate and promotional? But, I guess, breaking that down, are you still expecting migration to be occurring from the promotional to full rate and you're just going to be relying on promotional for loan balances going forward? Or more heavily relying on promotional balances going forward?","Mike Corbat","So, in order to maintain the mix that we have, we will need to continue to invest in promotional and bringing on promotional balances, and so we will continue to do that. They will continue now -- we have, obviously, a track record of understanding how to do that and understanding the timing for, which it takes for them to convert and flip into average interest earning balances, but we now are reaching a mix that we think is a healthy mix for us. And in order to maintain that, we will need to continue to invest.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned that you're seeing macro conditions are slowing in Latin America specifically in Mexico, but there was additional levers you could pull on the expense side. I mean, what are examples of those additional levers that you have that are already in budget? Thanks.","Mark Mason","In Latin America and in Mexico, what we saw last year, we saw expenses were up, I would say about 8% last year. And what I referenced this year or this quarter and last quarter, with the growth that we were seeing in EBIT. And the growth that we're seeing in EBIT is a byproduct in some ways of the investments spend that we made last year, now starting to pay dividends so to speak through 2019.","And so investments or the digital capabilities that we invested in from technology point of view, the organizational business model structure that we put in place in terms of our retail activity there and all of those things are starting to play out as expected.","We're about, I don\u2019t know halfway through the investment plan that we announced a couple of years ago and we have the opportunity, obviously, to temper the remaining spend that was planned for to ensure that it's done consistent with the market opportunity that we see. And so, that obviously is a factor that would help on the expense line.","And then, we're tempering growth in terms of the loan activity, loan volume in light of what's going on in the economy and that obviously helps at least -- as we think about expected cost of credit and what else, so those are number of factors that play out there.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vinings Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for taking the question this morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Marty Mosby","To hit on the RoTCE targets again, would success be reaching those goals in the fourth quarter of each of these years? Or would success be -- ultimate success actually for the whole year? So, as you\u2019re kind of envisioning that, I kind my targets, have you kind of reaching those by the end of each year, but are you really saying that it\u2019s going to be 13.5% average for the whole year of 2020?","Mark Mason","So, the target that we've set was for 12% was the full year return on tangible common equity target and as was the case for the 13.5% for 2020.","Marty Mosby","And then when you think about capital markets or institutional business, it's been compressed or depressed for a while. We keep thinking this is uncertainty in the marketplace or it's related to something that's causing just a short-term hit. But is this somewhat more secular and when you start thinking about your goals for next year especially in 2020, are we assuming some of this pressure that we're in begins to release? And can you give us any, kind of, feel for the estimate of what you kind of assuming the uncertainty and that has had an impact on the short-term capital markets types of businesses?","Mike Corbat","Sure. Marty, what I would say is that I think that there's part of it that is sec. But today, I would argue the majority of it is cyclical and what drives me to that statement is the intervention of central banks around the world and the amount of quantitative easing.","And if you tell me that QE is just there forever, then I would probably move towards the majority of it being secular. But at some point, the central banks have to start to back out of the market in terms of asset purchases, in terms of liquidity.","And I actually think that there's going to be an opportunity for those that are there to step in and provide the liquidity and leadership on that front. And again, what you see is -- and you see -- you follow it closely, you listen to what everybody says, we're not measuring trading by the year. We're not measuring it by the quarter.","Trading in today's age is kind of day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, a change of sentiment out of the Fed causes markets to react quickly. And I think it's what's -- what makes the forecasting as either Mark or I speak at these conferences so difficult. You tend to kind of speak mid-quarter and these things can change in either direction pretty quickly.","And so it's not a lack of engagement from the client perspective, it's a lack of conviction. And again I think we've got the combination of that with a bit of overhang from an environmental perspective. And clearly, I think the central banks continuing to be actively involved and in some ways taking part of the role that ultimately the banks will need to play in the future.","Mark Mason","And I think -- I'd add to that. As we see the pressures that we talked about impacting the trading businesses, in many ways we're not just standing still as these happens. And so you've seen us announce kind of the reorganization if you will of our spread products or in our spread products area.","We've recently announced under the new leadership in end markets combining kind of our rates and currencies business both in an effort to ensure that we're better covering our clients and better positioned to cover our clients.","And you'll continue to see as markets evolve and as the industry evolves for us to constantly be looking at our business model for ways to improve it and to improve the effectiveness of it, to improve the profitability and returns associated with it.","And so we're mindful of kind of how things are changing to Mike's points, they do appear to be cyclical in nature, but we're constantly evaluating our businesses and trying to position ourselves effectively.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. That was very helpful. And then lastly I wanted to ask you, as we think the Fed could begin to pull short-term interest rates down are we preparing to be able to begin to lower deposit rates instead of actually increasing them? So this has been a quick inflection point. But do you think that you'll be able to offset some of the impact as you're able to pull those deposit rates back down?","Mark Mason","Yes. I mean look we've seen -- we've talked a little bit about earlier about the betas and how they varied from the corporate clients and commercial clients to the consumer client base. I think there are other important factors as rates start to move in a downward direction. We have seen some of the players in the industry start to take rate down.","The other factors include the competitive landscape that's out there and how players decide to adjust the pricing, but it also includes, how you think about the relationship with the customer. And if it is in fact more than just that deposit relationship that's going to factor into how you think about pricing strategy, but I would imagine over and over time with a clarity on the direction that you will see betas respond over time.","Marty Mosby","And historically, we're seeing the backdrop of higher deposit betas and rates initially drop meaning you drop a little bit more and then eventually that has a slow down, kind of reverse what we had on the way up. So, thanks for your answers today.","Mark Mason","Yes.","Operator","The final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike.","Mark Mason","Good morning, Gerard.","Mike Corbat","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","You guys did very well in the CCAR this year in terms of the amount of capital that was reduced during the stress test. I think you dropped about 500 basis points, which was the lowest in maybe four or five years. What was the primary driver? Was it obviously de-risking the balance sheet, but it was primarily coming from Citi Holdings falling off?","And then second, is it continues to go this way, would you consider lowering your CET1 capital ratio -- your target that is?","Mark Mason","Yes. So, as Mike kind of alluded to earlier, there are a couple of factors that are involved in the CET1 ratio just taking that part of the question first. And obviously, we've had our management buffer that is included there of about 100 basis points. We have kind of a 3% placeholder in terms of the SCB and we're getting more clarity on that.","It seems like in some of the recent commentary and as we get more clarity on the SCB proposal and other proposals and it takes out the risk of variability to how we think about capital planning, we will certainly take a look at the 11.5% and see that that still makes sense.","In terms of the ask that we made of the $21.5 billion and what was approved, we obviously ran our scenario with an eye towards the targets that were set 11.5 in this base case, but also ensuring, we can achieve at least the minimums during the stress test scenario.","And the mix of assets that we have on balance sheet, we\u2019ve been thoughtful first about the client needs to the course of 2018 with an eye towards what the implication would be from a stress point of view, as we go into a CCAR cycle and the longer term planning of the business and ensure that we ended the year in a place, again, that allowed for us to serve those needs, but was mindful of the return necessary in light of stress losses that maybe a byproduct of those types of assets. And so that's what kind of played out through the scenario and through the ask that we ultimately made.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And Mark can you remind us are they still implementing the operating risk capital charge for companies like yours that have exited businesses, but you're still being assessed, the capital charge for those businesses, even though you're not in them?","Mark Mason","Yes.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then\u2026","Mark Mason","Up risk RWA.","Gerard Cassidy","And how much is that for you folks, that has cushioned you in terms of capital?","Mark Mason","I don't think we break that out.","Mike Corbat","We haven't broken that out.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Is there any color do you think coming from the new regulatory regime to maybe give you and your peers some relief in this area?","Mike Corbat","I don't think so.","Mark Mason","I don't think so.","Mike Corbat","I think you know as you look across -- we look across the industry peers, it's pretty consistent and that hasn't been contemplated. Just -- and, yes, just to be clear I think you noticed, but we're looking at -- or we utilized kind of LIBOR pretty standardized as it relates to our risk-weighted? That is the metric that is involved there.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then shifting over to the Institutional Clients Group. Mike, I think you touched on in the markets area that there are some cyclical factors affecting them. And you talked about the quantitative easing. In terms of secular in the cash equities area, did you guys see much of the MiFID II changes affecting your cash equity business this quarter?","Mike Corbat","This quarter? No. No. Again, I think, that over the kind of glide path of implementation, we really haven't. And we have been seen really many surprises. And we actually went into this and continue to believe that we've got the ability as clients kind of rationalize the counterparties to people that they deal with that Citi's in a position to be a winner in that, and I think we continue, I think as you've seen us continue the kind of climb up the tables, continue to take share there.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just -- can you guys give us a flavor for the Investment Banking pipeline, how does it look at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter?","Mark Mason","Yes. Again, on Investment Banking, kind of, as you saw in the numbers, we ended -- down 10%, but better than what I talked about at Morgan Stanley. The strength we saw in the end -- at the end of the quarter, was really a pull forward with both some ECM activity as well as in M&A.","That said, the dialogue that we have with clients in Investment Banking remains strong and fully engaged and quite constructive, and we've seen particular strength in the U.S. M&A activity continuing. So we kind of go into the balance of the year feeling good again about that dialogue, but also recognizing that all these factors that we talked about influences the corporate sentiment and willingness to take action.","Mike Corbat","And Gerard, when I think of it, in some ways it\u2019s -- the pipelines are fine. The pipelines are in pretty good shape, but what's the market willing to accept? What can get priced on what terms? And so I think the pipelines are there, I think the question is, in what ways are the market is open to get those deals done.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you for the color, gentlemen. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","And presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Elizabeth Lynn","Thank you, everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","Okay.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.45 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we continued to make good progress towards our strategic and execution priorities.","With half the year behind us, we\u2019ve remained on track to hit our financial targets in terms of return on assets in our efficiency ratio. We again achieved both positive operating leverage and strong loan growth in our core Citicorp businesses. Citi Holdings was profitable again during the quarter and we continued to wine down its assets which are down 22% from a year ago and Holding\u2019s assets now comprise only 6% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. We continued to utilize DTA this quarter bringing the total to $1.5 billion for the first half of 2015 and we added $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital during the quarter even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends.","Our tangible book value increased to $59.18 and our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to a 11.4% on a fully implemented Basel III basis. We submitted our resolution plan to the Fed and the FDIC which details how we would resolve Citi without the use of tax payer funds or harm to the financial system, viable resolution planning is critical to our making Citi as simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution.","In terms of our businesses, we saw balanced performance for the quarter across our institutional and consumer segments. In ICG, we\u2019ve grown our investment banking wallet share year-to-date and our Private Bank continued to show strong rise in revenue growth.","Treasury and Trade Solutions saw a revenue growth on a constant dollar basis. And our Markets and Securities Services revenue grew from a year ago driven by rates in currencies and security services.","In consumer banking, high quality checking deposit growth improve spreads and higher mortgage originations drove revenue growth in the U.S. while we\u2019ve optimized our branch footprint to focus on seven cities. And internationally, we also grew revenue, despite continued spread headwinds with growth across investment sales, deposits, loans and purchase sales.","We\u2019ve remained focused on our expenses and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. Despite significant investments in our regulatory and compliance functions, we continued to lower our overall headcount and we\u2019re reducing both our real estate footprint and our employees in higher cost locations.","These actions help to keep our expenses lower than they were a year ago even before the benefit of foreign exchange.","While I am pleased with our results for the first half of the year, the environment remains challenging and unsettled. Growth forecast continued to be downwardly revised and we still don\u2019t have clarity on when interest rates will begin to rise. While some volatility may create trading opportunities, we would much prefer to see growth strength inconsistently across the developed and emerging markets.","But whatever the economic conditions are we will remain focused on our clients and executing our strategy on behalf of our shareholders.","John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of items CVA, DVA and the prior period mortgage settlement that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned a $1.45 per share in the recent quarter compared to a $1.24 in the second quarter 2014.","On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the second quarter, we earned $4.7 billion generating a return on assets of 101 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.1%. Net income grew by over $700 million year-over-year driven by core improvement in Citicorp. Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.2 billion, but increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars. Expenses declined 7% year-over-year mostly reflecting a lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation and net credit losses improved offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.","The tax rate in the second quarter was 29% somewhat lower than the 31% outlook we had provided on a full year basis.","Turning to the first half of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56%. Net income grew by 17% year-over-year, we generated a ROA of a 103 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10.5%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $632 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wine down of Citi Holdings.","Deposits also decreased 1% driven by Citi Holdings including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year.","On Slide 5, we provide more detail on second quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 5% year-over-year mostly driven by growth in our institutional franchise and revenues declined in Citi Holdings reflecting continued asset reductions as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of last quarter.","As a result of the HFS accounting treatment, OneMain loans are classified as other assets. As such approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction to other revenue during the second quarter. This lowered both revenues and cost of credit by an equal amount and therefore had a neutral impact on earnings.","On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citi core expenses were down 1% as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and repositioning cost will largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets.","On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 22% year-over-year in the second quarter. And as I just described, we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with 5% growth in revenues and 1% decline in expenses in constant dollars. And for the first half of 2015, we achieved the Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.1%.","Turning to Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter with over a $150 million in net income. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with a $116 billion of assets or 6% of total Citigroup assets.","On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 25% year-over-year driven higher revenues, lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit cost, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by spread compression and ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets.","In Latin America, we grew revenues 3% driven by modest loan and deposit growth in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of selling our consumer franchise in Honduras last year. And in Asia revenues were roughly flat year-over-year as 3% growth in retail banking revenues including wealth management was offset by lower card revenues.","Asia card loans and purchase sales both grew year-over-year by 4% and 5% respectfully but this growth was offset by lower spreads driven by continued higher payment rates and the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets. We continued to believe these headwinds will abate somewhat in the second half of 2015. Asia card revenues grew by 3% sequentially in the second quarter.","In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchaser sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses declined 5% as lower repositioning cost were partially offset by the impact of volume growth, higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments and credit cost declined from last year.","Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Net income of $1.1 billion declined slightly year-over-year as higher revenues, lower expenses and lower net credit losses were more than offset by a decline in the net loan loss reserve release.","Total revenues grew 1% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 11% from last year, reflecting continued loan and checking deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads. Branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% from last year as 5% growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans mostly driven by the continued runoff of promotional rate balances and higher payment rates. And retail services revenues were flat to last year with improved spreads being offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments.","Total expenses declined 3% mostly driven by ongoing efficiency savings as we have continued to rationalize our branch footprint and capture the benefits of our global scale in cards. Our retail banking results reflect the strong progress we\u2019re making in North America.","Over the past year, we have reduced our branch count by 15% to 779 branches. And at the same time, we've improved the overall productivity of our network, concentrating our resources in 70 markets and deepening our relationships with our target clients. Despite the branch reductions, we grew checking account balances by 7% year-over-year. Card acquisitions per branch were up 10% year-over-year on a same store basis and we continued to enhance our retail mortgage origination platform reducing our reliance on third parties and better integrating our operations. Over 80% of our growth in origination volumes year-over-year came through retail channels.","Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favorable in the second quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained broadly stable and in Latin America. the NCL rate improved in line with a lower delinquency rate.","Slide 11 shows the expense trends for the global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 54% including overall 150 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. For the first half of the year, the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53.3%, down from 56% last year. We now expect the total consumer efficiency ratio for 2015 to be somewhere in the range of 52% to 53% consistent with our plans to begin gradually increasing the level of investment spend during the second half of the year, primarily in the U.S. branded cards.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12; revenues of 8.6 billon in the second quarter grew 2% from last year and declined 6% from the prior quarter, total banking revenues of 4.4 billon were roughly flat to last year and up 4% sequentially.","Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billon were down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 5% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. And while trade revenues continue to present the headwind this quarter, we see some early positive signs that spread maybe stabilizing. Both cash and trade revenues increased sequentially up 3% in total.","Investment Banking revenues of 1.3 billon were down 4% from last year as higher M&A revenues were more than offset by lower underwriting activity as compared to a very strong second quarter last year consistent with overall market trends. Year-to-date, investment banking revenues were up 4% driven by strong M&A results and we have gained overall wallet versus 2014 particularly in North America.","Private Bank revenues of 746 million grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in investments and capital markets products as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of 445 million were down 2% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues grew 4% from last year as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads.","Total Markets and Security Services revenues of 4.2 billion grew 4% year-over-year and declined 12% sequentially. Fixed income revenue of 3.1 billion were down slightly from last year as continued strength in rates and currencies was offset by lower revenues in spread products.","Rates and currencies revenues grew by double digits year-over-year in the second quarter as investor client activity and market volatility were improved versus last year, G10 rates was the key driver of growth. In North America in particular as we saw strong client activity and a favorable trading environment offset by a small decline in G10 foreign exchange.","Local market rates and currencies grew modestly year-over-year driven by our franchise in Asia. In spread products however, activity levels declined versus last year in credit products in particular resulting in lower revenues.","On a sequential basis, fixed income revenues declined 12% driven by seasonal factors as well as the lower rates and currency activity as compared to a strong first quarter.","Equities revenues of 653 million were down 1% year-over-year and down 25% sequential. Our equities revenues this quarter included a charge of 175 million for valuation adjustments related it certain financing transactions. And as of today, we have a remaining exposure with respect to these transactions of less than a $100 million. Excluding the adjustments, equities revenues would have increased by 26% from last year, driven by growth and derivatives, improved trading performance EMEA and strong client momentum in Asia.","In Security Services, revenues were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequential reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operative expenses of 4.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation and credit was a positive in the quarter.","On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57% including roughly 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges and our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the mid-point of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.","Slide 14 shows the result for the Corp and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year and sequential, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks as well as real estate sales in the recent quarter, partially offset by hedging activities and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.","Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings asset which totaled a $116 billion at quarter end, down 22% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in winding down these assets. During the quarter, we closed the sales of our consumer businesses in Peru and Nicaragua and we have signed agreements to sell an additional $32 billion of assets including our consumer businesses in Japan, Egypt, Costa Rica and Panama as well as OneMain Financial.","On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.7 billion declined by over 300 million from last year, driven by the reduction in assets as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of the quarter. As I described earlier, as a result of the HFS accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue during the second quarter. The HFS treatment had no impact on expenses which declined 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the asset reductions.","On Slide 17, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to strength.","Our net interest margin increased sequentially to 295 basis points, driven by a higher than expected contribution from trading NIM which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Excluding this impact, our net interest margin would have been closer to 291 basis points and we expect to maintain roughly this level for the third quarter.","Looking to the fourth quarter, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestiture including OneMain at our Japan retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly 7 basis points before using any part of the associative gains to redeem high cost dept.","We believe we can ultimately mitigate more than half of this NIM pressure through a combination of the upcoming debt redemption actions as well as the April acquisition of the Costco portfolio.","On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to a 11.4% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% and our tangible book value grew to $59.18 per share.","In summary, we continued to make progress in the second quarter with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends.","For the first half of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial targets with a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55%, a Citigroup ROA of a 103 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.5%. Of course we would expect our results to be stronger in the first half of the year given the seasonality of our markets business. But for the full year, we continued to expect to deliver a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a Citigroup ROA of over 90 basis points.","Finally, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position improving our CET 1 ratio to a 11.4% and our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.7% even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and common dividends this quarter.","Turning to the second half of this year, we continued to expect modest revenue growth in Citicorp. In consumer, in North America, we expect continued underlying revenue growth in our retail banking franchise, although comparisons for the prior year will be impacted by certain onetime items that benefited our mortgage business last year as previous disclosed. And the North America cards, revenue will likely remain under pressure in the second half of the year as it will take some time for our incremental investment spend to drive top line results.","In international consumer, we continue to believe we can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage year-over-year in the second half of 2015, driven by continued modest growth in Mexico as well as continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds in Asia as we begin to lap some of the spread compression and regulatory changes we absorbed last year.","Turning to the institutional franchise, we continued to see good momentum across Corporate Lending, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services and the Private Bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year in constant dollars.","Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market, but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise generating 4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half with overall wallet share gains versus 2014.","And finally, in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. In Citi Holdings we remained focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven.","As I\u2019ve described earlier we have signed agreements with a sale of $32 billion of assets virtually all of which we expect to close by year-end. And in particular, we continue to work towards a late third quarter sale of OneMain financial. We expect credit cost to increase somewhat in the second half of the year driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline staying at or below our current size.","And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning, guys.","Mike Corbat","Hi. Thank you, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","May be we could take a little bit just about the expense trajectory from here, you highlighted higher regulatory expenses in some investments in U.S. cards, but maybe you can kind of give us, but you\u2019ve also haven\u2019t seen much of a decline in markets expenses in the corporate bank yet, seasonally we should expect some decline revenues. And then layering - maybe layering on top of that date on single operating platform in the global retail business and what that could mean for expenses longer term? Thanks.","John Gerspach","Lots of mouthful Jim, okay.","Jim Mitchell","Yeah.","John Gerspach","It\u2019s alright, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll try to take it one at a time. As we\u2019ve said we\u2019re really focused on operating Citicorp towards an efficiency ratio and so we\u2019re committed to operating Citicorp overall in an efficiency ratio in that mid-50% range for the year. And so that\u2019s you know \u2013certainly near term that\u2019s what you should expect us to do.","Regarding some of the items that you mentioned, I do think that as we get further into next year, certainly we begin to see some of the regulatory cost growth, those trends begin to abate. So we think that we are towards the end of that growth cycle, but that\u2019s something really for 2016 story, I don\u2019t see that for the second half of this year.","As for everything else, we\u2019re focused on being the most efficient that we possible get can, we\u2019ve given you the efficiency targets for those different businesses. And certainly in a different rate environment, we would certainly expect our efficiency performance to be even better.","Jim Mitchell","But ex-rates you would say 55 is sort of your steady state?","John Gerspach","You know we said mid-50s for this year, could we do something more sure, but you take a look at the progress that we\u2019ve made already, we\u2019re operating Citicorp at 55%, we\u2019re operating Citigroup overall with an efficiency ratio of 56%. I\u2019d say that to date we are certainly well ahead of what most of our peer institutions have been able to do. So I feel pretty good about the work that we\u2019ve already done and while, we can continue and we always will continue to get better. I don\u2019t know that we want to get much better. We do want to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough power to make important investments in those Citicorp businesses.","Jim Mitchell","Now that\u2019s fair. And then maybe one just accounting question on the DTA you used 1.2 billion last quarter, it seems like that dropped the values using up 300 million this quarter, yet looks like North America net income was pretty similar to last quarter, why the balance, why not using more DTAs this quarter?","John Gerspach","Well the answer there is three initials OCI. When you take a look at what happened on the available for sale portfolio which some of their rate rise that we had, OCI ended up impacting us. If you take a look at the contribution from earnings, the contribution from earnings on DTA was roughly similar to the first quarter both Citicorp and Citi Holdings combined to use roughly $800 million of DTA in both the first and the second quarter, but the difference in the way the two quarters pan out really has to do with OCI.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. First one is just the timing and the puts and takes you mentioned OneMain be in the late third quarter hopeful. Can the debt repurchase coincide with that, how long of a delay there and then also Costco coming in. I am just more of timing the good guidance you give us on the puts and takes on the NIM in the back half and going as a next year?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I mean you know Glenn, what we\u2019re working to would be to do the best job we can of matching up the cost of the debt buybacks with the gain recognition on OneMain, that\u2019s a very much our focus and that\u2019s what we are going to try to do.","And then as far as Costco, you know as we\u2019ve said that contract is due to kick in April 1st of next year, so that will be something towards the second quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Great, I\u2019ll look for a simple clarification on the equities and the 170 as I think you said charge on the valuation side, what were you financing, why is get revalue, I am just curious of the mechanics, I understand that it\u2019s not going to repeat I hope?","John Gerspach","No, these are just financing transactions that result from the processing and funding of client treating activity primarily on our prime brokerage business. And the charge that I mentioned was related to a very limited number of financing transactions where we just felt that was necessary, they were just the value of collateral to reflect the current estimate of its liquidity characteristics.","Glenn Schorr","Is that - is that means there is some realized losses related to PB balances because it\u2019s a - actually don\u2019t think I am in real \u2026?","John Gerspach","No, no, no - no, no, this is not they do is realized losses at all. As matter of fact I would say that given what we know today based upon everything that we\u2019ve got, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve just took an appropriate and a prudent charge to revenues. We continue to work with the parties involved and so this is still very much a work in process. As of today all the promise payments have been made on schedule and we anticipate that these financing transactions will be resolved hopefully over the next several weeks.","And to your question is as long as the remaining schedule payments are received, we will not realize a loss and therefore the charge that we\u2019ve actually taken would actually be reversed back driven.","Glenn Schorr","Good, here is a last one. I thought given all the volatility and pick and your EM heavy franchise, the local markets franchise, I thought the performance is good concerning all the disruption late in the quarter. I am just curious, was there disruption late in the quarter and the things that happened late in the quarter, have we seen a reversal of any of that so far in July?","John Gerspach","You know I\u2019d say we had a couple of periods of disruption during the quarter that we manage to work our way through. And I think it\u2019s a little bit early right now to make comments on the overall tone what\u2019s rating will be for the balance of the third quarter, but we managed to work our way through a series of events.","Glenn Schorr","Alright, thanks a lot John.","John Gerspach","Alright.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, John.","John Gerspach","Hi.","Brennan Hawken","Just to clarify, you guys sort of adjusted the GCB target for the full year versus last quarter but is there any impact to your target that you are shooting for to exit the year or does that still remain in the previous rate?","John Gerspach","No, the - what we would say is we haven\u2019t adjusted the target. The target is remains that we believe that business should be able to operate it in an efficiency ratio of 49% to 52%. However given where we are in this year and given the fact that we do want to begin to put some additional marketing spend against U.S. branded cards in the third and fourth quarter which we think is the right thing to do from a top line - future top line growth point of view. The overall efficiency ratio for the business for this year is likely to be slightly higher than 52% somewhere in that 52% to 53% range.","We\u2019ll give you guidance on next year and where we expect that business to be when we are talking about the third and the fourth quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, thanks for that. And I know that sequential quarter doubt is can be somewhat difficult, but is it possible to provide some color on what drove the pickup in Citicorp expenses quarter-over-quarter on a constant dollar basis and maybe the quarter-over-quarter uptick in quarter efficiency for GCB?","John Gerspach","Yeah, most of the expense increase that we are seeing really has to do with pressure coming out of regulatory and compliance types of cost. I think that\u2019s something that you are probably here throughout the industry at this point in time.","Brennan Hawken","Okay and those regulatory and compliance costs are captured in the quarter expense as opposed to be considered legal and repositioning right?","John Gerspach","Absolutely.","Brennan Hawken","Perfect.","John Gerspach","They are in our core operating expense and everything is in our efficiency ratio.","Brennan Hawken","Got it, got it. And so is that way you guys highlighted on the expense front in international GCB that you had the up west from volumes but you didn\u2019t see that translation into revenue, is that because of that regulatory headwind?","John Gerspach","Well that\u2019s not the - that\u2019s not an expense headwind but that is a different type of regulatory headwind. As I think I mentioned in the past, what happened in Asia especially last year and it continues somewhat into this year, almost every country has passed some form of what the U.S. did back in 2010 with the Card act and so they put in a series of debt caps and interest rate caps. So those are headwinds that are impacting us on a revenue point - from a revenue point of view and we now believe, we do believe that those spread headwinds are beginning to abate particularly in the second half of the year as we lap the imposition of those new regulation. But that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting us on the revenue line. That\u2019s a little different from the other regulatory and compliance headwinds that we faced on the expense line.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, terrific. Last question from me, thinking about Holdings and the North American mortgage book, as of last quarter, about 24 or so billion of the 54 billion mortgage was second lean which is might saying that it\u2019s basically not market above, so I am just kind of curious of the remaining roughly 50 billion of mortgage that is first lean. How much of that do you carry the core responding second lean on your balance sheet and therefore you probably wouldn\u2019t want to sell those mortgages to put yourself kind of orb yourself negatively in the structure, I just trying to think about sizing what\u2019s left to sell in mortgage?","John Gerspach","You know Brennan I don\u2019t have that particular figure either with me or in my head, so I can\u2019t answer that question for you right now. We do have as you can see later in the deck, of the mortgage that remaining 51 of mortgages, about 23 of that is home equity. And as you can see that\u2019s declining at a fairly steady rate of about $1 billion a quarter. Obviously we\u2019re going through the reset period now \u201815, \u201816 and \u201817 are the year where virtually about 13 billion of 12 billion of that portfolio go through rate reset. And the rate resets are performing well now. What we\u2019re hopeful of is that the market begins to get a sense that the rate reset issue is not really a big detuned that perhaps a market for home equity loans will open up if not later this year then perhaps earlier mid next year. And then that might give us the opportunity to work down those balances in home equity loans at an even faster rate.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks a lot for all the color John.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi Matt.","Matt O'Connor","The color on the NIM - the color on the NIM in terms of OneMain and some of the houses was helpful. Just as I just try and put all together and thing about the earnings impact and the capital impact of those three things, one there in Costco debt restructuring. Any color there you can give us?","John Gerspach","No, I really haven\u2019t put the whole capital impact a story of each of those things into my head, so I apologize for that. Obviously we are not doing, OneMain is something that we\u2019ve focused on for some period of time, so that is all part of the holding story and trying to continue to wind down holding, so we would look at that as something is exiting a what is really a good business but if one that just doesn\u2019t fit with our strategy and Costco we continue to believe that that is something that will be accretive to next year. So we feel well about that. But I can\u2019t link the capital story for you of those three separate things, I am sorry Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, are the earnings impact, you said past that a way is to have the NIM drag but obviously there is some credit cost and expenses and things like that especially to OneMain as well?","John Gerspach","Yeah, OneMain you know again, OneMain is part of Holdings. You know what we are trying to do with Holdings and our target for Holdings is to remain above breakeven. OneMain certainly is a contributing of significant contributor to Holdings profitability but it\u2019s by no means the only profitable business that exists in that portfolio. And so we continue to believe that we can even with the disposition of OneMain, the earnings of the remaining portfolio plus the effect of the ongoing expense reductions as well as the continued retirement of high cost funding and we\u2019ll have other episode of gains and losses. So we think that that will enable us to maintain Holdings into next year at no worse than breakeven on an annual basis.","Matt O'Connor","Okay and then just within North America retail banking you mentioned that passes spreads for improving and that was a key driver of the revenue. What\u2019s driving their deposit pressure that just mix of what is that?","John Gerspach","Yeah, we\u2019ve been - if you take a look at our overall focus on deposits, deposit quality and cost of something that we\u2019ve been focused on for the better part of two plus years at this point in time. We see a definitive tradeoff as far as what you can do to be able to optimize your deposits. When it comes to optimizing deposits, we look at both making sure that we are improving the liquidity value of the deposits as well as then optimizing the cost, but there is a lot of situations where we\u2019re actually willing to pay more for high quality deposits if it gives us the ability then to shed low quality non-operating deposits.","The whole - this whole topic of non-operating deposits is something that again we\u2019ve been focused on now for five, six quarter and we\u2019ve been steadily driving down our non-operating deposits. You know that\u2019s benefited us both from terms of a liquidity point of view and I think from and our ability then to overall fund the franchise.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","You next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. With regard to your efficiency ratio, you are at 55% for Citicorp, you mentioned the growth and some of the regulatory growth should abate next year and you also said it should be better if and when interest rates go up, so and you saw project Rainbow actually if you give an update on that? So where should the long term efficiency ratio go and at what point would you think about being more aggressive with that target and again an update on project Rainbow?","Mike Corbat","Mike I think a lot of and John touched on it a bit where we go with our efficiency ratio is going to be function of the environment. We would be pushing towards in a rising rate environment. Obviously we\u2019ve talked about our sensitivity the rates and the impact in terms of revenues and our belief that we could get a lot of those revenues to the bottom line as rates begin to come up. And so we\u2019ve tried to be mindful, we said when we set to mid-50s that was predicated on a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth environment which is unfortunately proved to be the case as that revenue environment changes we would adjust our efficiency of that again trying to deliver positive operating leverages a result of that.","Mike Mayo","And what about your ROA target, I mean you added over 100 basis points low and is 90 basis point. At what point would you consider increasing that target and I am not saying to do away with the concrete targets over a concrete timeframe but for next year or long term normalize so where should the ROA be?","John Gerspach","You know Mike, let me just jump in for a second because I think it\u2019s going to be hard for us to give a long term guidance as far as return on assets until we get more clarity around some of the regulatory rules that still need to be set including especially the TLAC. So it\u2019s possible that all financial institutions including us might actually as a result of TLAC, we force to put on levels of debt that would serve no other purpose - no other purpose but is certainly serve the purpose to end up grossing up our balance sheet which could therefore inhibit any bank\u2019s ability to improve ROA. So before we give longer term targets on ROA, we\u2019d like to see the rules under which we\u2019ll need to be operating.","Mike Mayo","And then just going back to my earlier question, one factor that\u2019s more unique to you guys project Rainbow as you consolidate your systems, you think it had more efficiency gains from that how much you are going to reinvest some of the savings, where do you stand with that?","Mike Corbat","You know Rainbow continues on its path of implementation, we continue to go live in countries around the world. And as we\u2019ve talked about historically when we launched Rainbow, we launched it with the premise that it would be an expense savor for us and in essence have rationalized the target that. What we\u2019ve seen is a combination of not just expense save but also some revenues gains as we\u2019ve got the system in place. We\u2019ve talked about from timeframe perspective, we continue to roll that out and fund it organically. And so work in progress but the result so far are quite positive.","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [indiscernible] on for John.","John Gerspach","Hi.","Unidentified Analyst","Just had a quick question on revenues, the revenue in corp other has jumped up a little bit last few quarters and I know you mentioned some gains. So just if you could talk a little bit about what level at you are a little bit more sustainable at?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I think that you know longer terms you\u2019d probably expect Corp other revenues to be something in the 100 to maybe 200 range, so somewhere maybe even 150 to 200. So this is at somewhat higher levels right now. And we noted the fact that it included some gains on the sale of real estate and continued debt buybacks. Debt buybacks, the hedging activities that\u2019s all what we consider to be normal type of activity that could go into Corp other.","The sale of the real estate gains and that generated about a $140 million of gains this quarter. So that\u2019s what I think you are really seeing is pumping up Corp other.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then somewhat follow-up, looking at international consumer loan growth, it looks like trends are pretty good, ex-Korean, just wondering sort of what your outlook was there?","John Gerspach","For international consumer or for Korea, I just want to make sure.","Unidentified Analyst","For international consumer more broadly.","John Gerspach","Okay. Well again we think that the drivers that we have in that business continue to reflect pretty well on the strength of the franchise. We would continue to expect to see both growth in deposits and average loans. And hopefully investment sales will continue, obviously investment sales are somewhat depended upon the overall state of the markets. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve gotten I think reasonable - in the current environment reasonable growth coming out of the retail banking piece of the franchise. We had 3% revenue growth this quarter. We need to get the card\u2019s franchise back contributing and that\u2019s really more matter of just being able to lap those regulatory changes and make sure then that we\u2019ve seen the abatement in the spread pressure that we\u2019ve otherwise been facing, which is why we are more confident on the revenue growth of that franchise going into the second half of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thank you.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi Steven.","Steven Chubak","Hi. John I had a one quick question on capital. I was hoping you could give us some inside or incremental color on what contingency plans you might have in place if the Fed were to incorporate GCB surcharges in CCAR, just given that it could have a pretty meaningful impact on your return profile as well as your payout capacity?","John Gerspach","Yeah, if the - let me approach it this way, one, if that would have to happen it would impact the entire industry not just us. So we\u2019d really have to take a look at what the entire industry response is.","Secondly, it will depend upon what GCB surcharge they were to add to the CCAR requirements. I don\u2019t know how the GCB surcharge will be calculated, I guess we\u2019ll all find that out Monday and that should be informative. If they give us the opportunity, if they come up with a GCB surcharge that we can actually manage and therefore take effective actions against then certainly part of our action plan would be to really focus on managing down our GCB surcharge.","Thirdly, if they were to add the GCB surcharge into CCAR, I don\u2019t know what changes they might also make in the CCAR process itself. Don\u2019t forget some of the things that they build into CCAR such as the market shock actually serve the purpose of putting more stress on the larger institutions already. So you would think that if they were going to put the pressure on the capital then to be fair, they might take some of the pressure of the CCAR calculation themselves. So there is a lot that is unknown about what may happen and so contingency plans at this in time are somewhat dependent upon the scenario in which we\u2019re ultimately dealing.","Steven Chubak","I understand. I appreciate that color John. And maybe just one more picky question on DTA, I did appreciate the color you had given surrounding the AOCI impacts of weighing on the pace of consumption. But just wanted to get a sense as to what drove the increase in the net operating losses, just given AOCI hedge are typically a timing DTA as you and it did increase by north of 500 million which is not immaterial?","John Gerspach","No. No, no, no, you\u2019re absolutely right. What the - that roughly 500 plus million dollar increase that you see in the back of the investor deck during the second quarter was actually cause by a $900 million in state and local net operating losses. That all resulted from audit settlements that we concluded during the quarter. So that influx of the state and local NOLs was partially offset by the utilization of roughly $500 million of FTCs in the quarter and the difference is it has to do with the general business credits. But the NOLs that we added in as a result of the audit settlements have got a 20 year life on them. So we\u2019ve got every confidence in the world that we\u2019re going to be able to generate use of those that $900 million of NOLs. And importantly the FTCs that were utilizing or the FTCs that will actually near term expiration dates in \u201817 and \u201818.","Steven Chubak","Okay, thanks for clarifying that John and thanks for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem Steven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Just a follow-up question on the expense ratio and just a little bit of different angle on asking about the consumer where you\u2019ve indicated that for the near term the expense ratio would rise as you are reinvesting in the business. I know just you didn\u2019t change the overall company expense ratio, so just wanted to see if what you are saying is you\u2019ve got other cost saves even further ahead of plan happening elsewhere in the organization that\u2019s funding, this investments spend in consumer or you are saying we see good payback relatively good timeframe and as a result we\u2019re just going to let this rise up a little bit as reinvesting, we\u2019ll get it back next year?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s some combination of all of that Betsy. When we take a look at trying to manage Citi, overall Citi to an efficiency ratio, it\u2019s very much as you say we\u2019ve got several things to look at, the performance of the ICG which from an expense point of view, even at efficiency ratio point of view this year has been quite good. We\u2019ve got consumer which has made great progress on its expenses but with the performance of the ICG and the performance of other things that we see in some of the staff functions, we feel that we\u2019ve got a little room then to let consumer and run this year at slightly higher efficiency rations and still bring the full firm in at our overall target.","And we thing that letting consumer go a little bit higher in this year especially because of some higher levels of marketing and investment spend will actually then have much better payoffs in the future exactly as you outlined.","Betsy Graseck","And so when you are thinking about where you putting your incremental dollar to work, as you as considering the best place right now?","John Gerspach","We\u2019re very focused on U.S. branded cards. We think that U.S. branded cards is an excellent business. And consumer overall we think gives us excellent returns, we obviously have a lot of things going on with Rainbow and what not, so you don\u2019t want to overload activity into anyone area, but focusing specifically on branded cards, we think that there is good payback to begun from branded cards. As a matter of fact well all the investment that we\u2019ve made in order to I think that Jud and his team have done a great job as far as completely restacking the product offering that we have in U.S. branded cards in order to get the maximum amount of the work that they have done, we need to put a little bit more marketing dollars at work.","Betsy Graseck","And then just lastly on card, you indicated that you are likely to get back some of the NIM compression from some of the - from the exists impart from portfolios like Costco, you know it\u2019s - you know understanding that there is some other portfolios out there that could be of interest to, could you just give us a senses to how you are thinking about, what kind of financial hurdles and goals you have in mind when you are looking at portfolios for purchase?","John Gerspach","Well, we look at each portfolio standalone. We understand the targets that we\u2019re working towards. And it\u2019s not just a matter of looking at a portfolio and seeing does it make economic sense, it has to be a portfolio that really fits in with the business, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Costco was so attractive to us just because of the incredible client strength that they bring and it meshes is very well with the client profile that we\u2019re looking at. So for us Costco was a natural fit, other portfolios may not have that same good client mix.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi good morning.","John Gerspach","Good morning.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","My question is on how your best in class capital ratios particularly on the leverage is impacting your client conversations in markets. Do you get a sense that some of your competitors that held for example a much lower SLR and therefore have a less balance sheet to give are being less aggressive with in terms of competing in market or not really as competition really as curious as ever and the leverage ratio differences aren\u2019t really making an impact?","Mike Corbat","Erika, it is Mike. I would say that competition is fear so I am not going to dismiss that. But we don\u2019t have some of those same constraints and I would say we probably see it more pronounced in Europe where the European banks by enlarge our constrained by their leverage ratios. And I think we\u2019ve been able to consistently be in front of our clients and smartly trying to use our balance sheet with them which obviously drives the ancillary revenue. So we have seen that and have tried to take advantage of that as an opportunity.","Erika Najarian","Got it and just a follow-up question. John, the way you sort of answered Steven\u2019s GCB question on the CCAR, I am assuming also that until we get final rules in TLAC, we won\u2019t see you guys lagging in any potential issuance ahead of having the rules finalize in the U.S.?","John Gerspach","You know we\u2019re continuing to do debt issuance if that\u2019s request and obviously we\u2019ve matter of fact when we take a look at the amount of preferred and the amount of debt that we issued last question, I\u2019d say was quite substantial. We issued roughly - roughly we issued $2 billion of preferred, we did $3 billion of sub-debt and we did $5.5 billion worth of senior debt. So we did $10.5 billion worth of issuance last quarter and of course we also bought some debt back but overall we were in net issuer of 8 plus billion dollar worth of offerings.","Erika Najarian","And based on how you are understating the proposals, could you give us a range on what your TLAC is at the end of the quarter, the TLAC ratio?","John Gerspach","We\u2019ll give you more guidance on that next week when we do fixed income call, but the numbers that I\u2019ve seen would suggest that our TLAC ratio now is a - instep a little bit over where it was last quarter, I think we\u2019re at 21.3% as of the end of June, but we\u2019ll form up all the numbers for you when we do the fixed income call next week.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thanks so much.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon, gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls - my questions. John, just a question on the U.S. branch system, that\u2019s down about 15% year-over-year, however you\u2019ve got sort of expense reductions at least for part of this expense reduction is down about 3% year-over-year, is there more to go in terms of the U.S. branch count or are you pretty much done with that?","John Gerspach","I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much done. There is still probably some slimming that we could do as far as completing the focus of the branches on the seven focus cities. I think we\u2019re a little over a 90% now of branches that are in our seven focus cities. So there could be some additional but I think also importantly there is probably some case to made for opening up some additional outlets in some of those cities as well just to make sure that we\u2019ve actually got the proper coverage.","I used the term outlet as opposed the branch because I am not sure that in the future every outlet that we open will look like one of the branches that are out there today. It\u2019s much more likely that the branches of the future will be somewhat smaller in line with the fact that many more of our customers who are transacting with us by alternate mean is using mobile banking and the Internet.","Matt Burnell","And then from my follow-up, just a question on your comment in terms of investment banking taking market share, it sounded like you were taking more market share in North America perhaps then at least in this quarter than you did in outside the U.S., is that also true in the markets business because a number of other banks this quarter have implied that they continue to get market share at least on the market side of the equation outside the U.S. to a greater degree than they are getting it in the - within the U.S.?","John Gerspach","You know you take a look at market in wallet share on any individual quarter. We try to look more at market share in longer term trends. We are continuing to add market in wallet share especially against our focus clients in both investment banking as well as with our markets business. And we see that as a strength of our franchise but I can\u2019t tell you whether we actually took market share in a particular business during the quarter. I don\u2019t track it quarter-to-quarter, I tend to look at more trends on a trailing 12 months basis.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally, you did 26% increase in equity markets if we exclude the valuation adjustment. How much of that was the result of improved activity in Asia?","John Gerspach","A very piece of it that stem from Asia, Asia was one of our primary engine for growth. I don\u2019t have the percentage in my head but it was - it was the primary driver.","Matt Burnell","Great, thanks very much John.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. John, just a couple of clarification questions please. One, I just want to make sure on the efficiency guidance for GCB, was that new guidance than what you had previously stated?","John Gerspach","I believe it was.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And so can you just repeat that?","John Gerspach","Previously, just to be clear, I believe that the when I spoke last quarter we would have said that we thought that GCB would be end the year with have an efficiency ratio for the full year near the top end of the range that we had set out the 49% to 52%. But with the some of the incremental spend what we are looking to do particularly in U.S. branded card that\u2019s going to knock that just slightly above. So that\u2019s why I wanted to make sure you were aware of the fact that it\u2019s likely to end they have for the full year an efficiency ratio slightly above where I would have said at the last time.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. Great, thanks for clarifying that. And just on the debt repurchases and the debt issuance that you went through with Erika a moment ago, where those consistent with the plan for this year or they - is the plan different than the one that that we talked about last quarter?","John Gerspach","No, it\u2019s consistent with the plan. I mean we may have pulled forward some of the issuance into the second quarter that we otherwise would have planned to do in the third quarter, but we\u2019re still on our plan and we\u2019ll have more to say about debt issuances on Tuesday.","Eric Wasserstrom","Sure. And the pull forward presumably was because of rate and market opportunity?","John Gerspach","Yeah, we have the opportunity to do some larger amounts than we otherwise would have given on the heels of certainly the first quarter results that we had and I think you\u2019ve seen kind of continues with the second quarter results, we found a favorable market for debt and we didn\u2019t want to disappoint any investors.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great, thanks very much.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Hi John.","John Gerspach","Hi.","Gerard Cassidy","John, can you remind us putting off to the side for a moment the possibility of GCB being included in CCAR, can you remind us what the binding constrain on the capital ratio, which ratio were you guys looking at as that binding constrain?","John Gerspach","Yeah, right now, if the GCB surcharge comes in at the 400 basis points that we would currently estimated to be, it\u2019s sort of running neck and neck between the CET 1 ratio including the GCB surcharge. And what we would look at as far as the CCAR requirements. And that is somewhat dependent upon the scenario that you might get out of CCAR et cetera but it\u2019s pretty much neck and neck CET 1 with GCB and CCAR.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thank you. You\u2019ve talked about growing the card business and you\u2019ve had success with acquisitions, now you are putting more muscle into growing that business organically. If you - as you go on the offence from the defensive position you\u2019ve been in the past, are there other areas you guys are looking to grow possibly through acquisitions separate from cards?","Mike Corbat","I would say that when we think of acquisitions as John spoke earlier would need to be very much in strategy and it would be probably much more bias towards portfolios rather than business acquisitions. So again around our framework fitting in business and having the right accretive attributes where worldwide open to portfolio purchases.","Gerard Cassidy","And then my final question, overall credit continues to improve for you folks and the industry but I did notice that nonaccrual area incorporate North America sequentially had a jump in your nonaccruals whereas Latin America had a significant improvement. Could you give us some color on both of those line items?","John Gerspach","Yeah, the - let\u2019s start with the Latin America line item, that really refluxed an asset sale that we had done, so we actually exited a nonaccrual loan during the quarter so that - you see that reflected in bringing down the nonaccrual loans in Latin America. And then as far as the increase in nonaccrual loans in North America that\u2019s largely driven by some additional classifications of nonaccrual loans coming out of our energy portfolio.","Gerard Cassidy","And was that as a result of the Shared National Credit Exam, I assume or nowhere something separate?","John Gerspach","Well, it\u2019s in connection with the Shared National Credit, we had decided to classify good portion of those loans is nonaccrual. And then what happens, so that let\u2019s leave it like that. But again so from an overall energy exposure point of view, our energy exposure actually declined during the quarter, as far as the exposure that we have to the producer type of client other than that we added to the energy exposure in what we consider to be more the high grade energy processors as far as our multinational clients. So we saw an overall increase in the energy exposure but a decrease in the exposure that we have to the exploration type of clients.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great, thank you. Yeah, most of my questions have been answered, so I have one follow-up questions related to the North America cards and the additional investment spend. I mean we think about it from a receivables point of view I mean where you have additional investment spend, I mean what are the expectations around receivable growth? I guess so differently, is that investment spend needed just to stabilize receivables or you expecting growth above from the arm what you have already because from 1Q to 2Q you saw 8% growth annualize, so you looking to get even further beyond that with those additional investment spend?","John Gerspach","I am not quite sure but that 8% number that you referenced that doesn\u2019t quite ring with me, but we would expect then that the incremental market. When you are thinking about cards, it is somewhat of a time sensitive process and so when you spend marketing dollars, the first thing you are doing is you are acquiring accounts then you make those accounts active then those accounts get into spending and then from that spending you end up growing receivables. So marketing dollars spend today are likely to be growing receivables more in the 2017 range than early on in 2016. So it\u2019s not a case of you just add marketing dollars and you certainly sprout receivables.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great, thank you.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","David Hilder","Thank very much. Just a quick question on the Citi Holdings assets, I think you said that Citi Holdings is at 6% of total assets and it looks like from the footnote, it\u2019s more like 13% of your risk weighted assets, so it looks like the risk weighted assets in Citi Holdings are not coming down as fast as total assets, do you think that kind of relationship will continue and is it related to any particular type of asset to the Holdings?","John Gerspach","Well when you take a look at Citi Holdings in particularly, as we got out of the risky assets in Citi Holdings early on we were very focused on making sure that we got out of the most risky assets in Citi Holdings. That relationship between risk weighted assets and GAAP assets in Citi Holdings has been steadily declining. So we\u2019ve got now a $116 billion worth of GAAP assets sitting there in Citi Holdings. The RAP assets, the risk weighted assets associated with Citi Holdings earnings $169 billion.","So you know David, we\u2019ve been de-risking the Holdings portfolio all along and so there isn\u2019t a big multiplier effect anymore associated with that holdings asset. Within that 169 billion, $49 billion of the risk weighted assets are there for operating risk. So it\u2019s really a $120 billion worth of credit and market risk RWA associated with $116 worth of GAAP asset, so it\u2019s virtually a one to one relationship at this point in time between credit and risk - market risk, risk weighted assets and GAAP assets.","David Hilder","Great. Actually the reference or explanation on operating risk is actually quite helpful. Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Very, very happy to help you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","John, I was very curious in your comment, most of the banks are getting ask about G-SIB in the inclusion in the CCAR, but now so we had done, there was some talk about counter cyclical buffer side the very beginning of this going into G-SIB. If you look at the counter cyclical buffer average for the money some of banks have 2.5%, the credit loss is in CCAR averaged 2.7%, you look at the G-SIB buffer average for the money center banks kind of looks like now it\u2019s around 3% and if you look at operational loses, it\u2019s actually 3.1%. So your concept of well what through the overall G-SIB buffer in the CCAR then they had have to make some adjustment to operational losses. I think I just was going to ask you to kind of think about that and expand on that concept?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I wasn\u2019t focused so much Marty on operational loses but there are other aspects of CCAR such as the market risk shock that we all go along with. That market risk shock is really targeted against the major banks. And because the way that market risk shock actually impacts the banks there is a doubling up effect on PPNR reduction and market risk shock. It\u2019s something that it\u2019s known by I guess CCAR [ph] autos and I mean - and again if there was going to be some add on the I can call it the denominator the capital, the I am going to say hope or my thought process would be that we could explore some reduction then in some of the add-ons that go into generating the losses.","But I agree with you, it wouldn\u2019t be operational risk, it\u2019s really just in the way that the CCAR calculations are done and the scenarios are constructed.","Marty Mosby","Just on saying that that would be coincide then all that these buffers are almost equaling the losses in CCAR and then when you look at the non-money center banks, they have very little operational loss at all and then have any G-SIB buffer. So it\u2019s just the parallel calculation seem to be more than just reveal?","John Gerspach","Yeah, maybe, I don\u2019t have any inside into how the Fed has come up with some of their models, but I am sure they are quite good at it.","Marty Mosby","Last thing I am going to ask is, and I appreciate the time. As you look at your tangible book value, you\u2019ve without these extra charges because you\u2019ve tied a lot of thing reserved and those what\u2019s are ahead but just assume that less of the head versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, are your ability to repurchase add or below tangible book value when the returns improving, growth this quarter annualize the tangible book values about 8%, it just seems like that acceleration could continue into the future and just want to see your thoughts on that? Thanks.","John Gerspach","Well, agree with you that we do think that overtime we have the ability to grow tangible book, obviously as I mentioned before one of the items that you are always focused on with tangible book is the impact of rates on your AFS portfolio and you\u2019ve seen that there were times when that can have a - that can play a heavy hand in dampening down the growth, but we do believe that if we can continue to perform we should the way we have been, we have the opportunity to continue to grow tangible book. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we think that continuing with stock repurchases is the right thing to do from a capital return point of view.","Marty Mosby","Thanks again.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.","Christopher Wheeler","Yes, good morning, gentlemen. David Hilder set my question out really well, he is colleague of mine. I actually do with the rundown of Citi Holdings that how that impacts this weighted assets because you mentioned the 34 billion which you basically got baked in and you just touched on the relationship between the GAAP assets and the RWA. So if we were to be looking at what is going to happen to the 12.79 billion of RWA you had fully faced at the end of the second quarter, I mean obviously I would imagine that a minimum would be 34 billion coming of that pro forma. And I supposed to question I am asking is how much more might come off in respect of the uplift between the GAAP assets and RWA? And also perhaps how much you think you might use in actually growing the business during that period? Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Christopher. Let me pass through some of those questions. First, just to be clear the assets that we\u2019ve got under contract is 32 billion, I think I heard you say 34.","Christopher Wheeler","I must - I think that\u2019s just me, I went too many bank results obviously in few days.","John Gerspach","Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to add to your numbers, but I just wanted to make sure that you\u2019ve focused on the 32. As much as I said that overall there is a virtually a one to one relationship between credit and market risk RWA and GAAP RWA that obviously is not the same with each asset that we have and included in that $32 billion worth of assets that I mentioned of course is the sale of our Japan retail bank. On our Japan retail bank would be one of those situations where the RWA associated where actually be much less than the GAAP assets. So I can\u2019t guide you to how much RWA is associated with the overall 32 but I wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to the conclusion that the 32 is one for one reduction in RWA.","Mike Corbat","And John the piece I would add to that is from an expectation perspective, John mentioned the $49 billion of assets associated with operations, as assets come down you can\u2019t simply release the ops RWA, it\u2019s going to take time to work through that, so you should expect to see as a percentage of Holdings RWA as we reduce assets that ops piece continuing to growth both as a percentage. Yeah.","Christopher Wheeler","Both as a percentage. Okay, thank you very much, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","Susan Kendall","Great, thank you all for joining us.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, Citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2013 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $350 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, or $0.06 a share. These results include the impact of $3.5 billion in legal reserves and repositioning costs, which we had disclosed in December. While these charges had the biggest impact on our results, we also saw a challenging end to the year, with macro uncertainties and falling oil prices resulting in a more difficult market environment than we had expected, particularly in the last few weeks of December.","At the same time, our institutional banking franchise continued to show solid revenue growth. In consumer banking, our U.S. franchise performed well and we showed modest growth in international consumer, even as the global economic growth remained uneven. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter and reduced assets to below $100 billion for the first time, driven by ongoing runoff in asset sales.","While the overall results for 2014 fell short of our expectations, we did make significant progress towards our priorities, and while some of the steps we took were painful, I believe they allowed us to put our franchise in a position to have a successful 2015. We're doing everything we can to maximize the benefits of our repositioning costs and throughout 2014 we worked hard to improve our efficiency and reduce our cost base. We reduced our head count by almost 10,000 people, closed 95 operation sites, shrunk our branch network by over 10% while increasing digital uptake by consumers, simplified our product offerings, and increased customer satisfaction as measured by net promoter scores.","We sold our consumer businesses in Spain and Greece and took important steps towards the exit of One Main. And in October, we announced plans to exit 11 consumer markets and have already signed two agreements regarding the sales of our Japanese retail business and our consumer business in Peru. These steps are part of our process to build one global consumer bank from a confederation of local banks.","Our institutional banking business performed well throughout the year, as we focused on serving our core clients. In investment banking, we gained share with our target clients across most regions, generating strong revenue growth, and despite the low interest rate environment, treasury and trade solutions grew revenues as well, as did our private bank.","While our markets businesses were impacted by volatility towards the end of the year, we'll continue to take steps to make sure that they are sized correctly for the environment we see going forward. After reviewing certain institutional businesses, we have decided to exit several non-core transactions businesses in order to further decrease our expense base and improve net income. These businesses will be reported out of Citi Holdings going forward.","For the first time since its establishment, Citi Holdings was profitable for the full year and we reduced its assets by 16%. By utilizing $3.1 billion in DTA, we exceeded 2013's utilization by $600 million and have now utilized $5.6 billion in the last two years. Despite significant legal challenges, we were still able to generate $11 billion in regulatory capital in 2014, bringing the total to $31 billion over the last two years.","During the year, we managed our balance sheet carefully. We grew our loan book in Citicorp and improved both our net interest revenue and margin from 2013 levels. We made Citi a safer and stronger institution in several ways. We invested in our risk, audit and compliant functions. We reduced our risk to asset profile by asset sales in business exits and we maintained a highly liquid balance sheet while improving the quality of our deposits. Our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios each increased over the course of the year.","Returning capital to our shareholders remains a critical priority. During the year, we invested in and strengthened our capital planning process by focusing on risk identification and scenario design, improved our models, and we fostered a deeper engagement with our businesses.","Last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve and we believe the submission reflects the progress we have made. We're fully committed to sustaining and building on these gains. As recent events have shown, there's no reason to think that the environment in 2015 will be any less challenging than the one we faced in 2014. While the recovery in the U.S. is gaining momentum, aided by lower energy costs, Europe is a continuing area of concern, with Russia and Greece facing the most immediate pressure. And while most emerging markets continue to grow, their economies remain the most vulnerable to external factors.","That being said, we feel good about how we're positioned and to meet the challenges. This is an important year for our firm and we're committed to reaching our efficiency and return on asset targets.","John will now go through the deck and then we'll answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to highlight a few items from the fourth quarter of 2013 that affect the comparability to this quarter's results as shown on Slide 3.","On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.82 in the fourth quarter of last year. This decline in EPS mostly reflects higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges versus last year.","On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $346 million, or $0.06 per share, including the impact of $3.5 billion of legal and repositioning charges. Revenues declined slightly on a reported basis to $17.8 billion, but were up 2% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses grew 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the higher legal and repositioning charges. Core operating expenses were flat, including a benefit from the impact of FX translation. Cost of credit improved from last year. And our tax rate was significantly higher this quarter at 72%, reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals.","On a full-year basis, revenues and core operating expenses were fairly stable versus last year. Legal and repositioning charges were significantly higher than the prior year, as we work to resize our operations and address legal issues. As we said in December, we believe we have put a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters behind us.","Cost of credit was a tail wind, driven by lower net credit losses. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans decreased slightly year-over-year to $645 billion, as 3% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits declined 4%, as we reclassified $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in Citicorp, given the sale announcement last month, and deposits continued to decline in Citi Holdings.","On Slide 5, we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In consumer banking, revenues were flat sequentially and up 3% year-over-year, driven by North America. Institutional revenues were down from last quarter, reflecting a difficult market environment and seasonally lower activity, but improved slightly from last year. And Citi Holdings revenues were down quarter-over-quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt. On a constant dollar basis, Citigroup revenues grew over $300 million, or 2% from the prior year.","On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related expenses were over $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and repositioning costs were roughly $650 million. Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion increased in constant dollars both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting increased regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process, higher volume-related expenses, and certain one-time items partially offset by efficiency savings.","The quarter-over-quarter increase of roughly $200 million was mostly comprised of an adjustment to accruals for certain non-income taxes, such as VAT, higher external legal and consulting fees, higher business volumes in a number of areas, and higher levels of expenses related to ongoing compliance and regulatory efforts, resulting from an acceleration of hiring and related spending originally planned for the first quarter of 2015. All of this increase from the prior quarter reflected expenses that were either non-recurring or already baked into our expected 2015 run rate.","Performance-based incentive compensation was down from the prior quarter. However, this benefit was largely offset by changes to assumptions related to the recognition of deferred compensation. And on a full-year basis, core operating expenses were roughly flat, as repositioning savings, reductions in Citi Holdings, and other productivity initiatives fully offset the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and growth-related costs.","On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. On a reported basis, Citicorp revenues of $16.5 billion declined slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while core operating expenses grew 2% driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, growth-related expenses, and certain one-time items I just described, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.","Credit costs improved modestly year-over-year, and the tax rate was significantly higher in the quarter reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals. On a full-year basis, the decline in net income mostly reflects higher legal and repositioning costs, partially offset by an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter, with roughly $160 million in net income compared to a loss of over $400 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $98 billion of assets, or 5% of total Citigroup assets.","Before I go into more detail on Citicorp, I would like to provide an update on our strategic actions in global consumer banking and describe some additional actions we are taking in the institutional clients group. Starting with consumer, last quarter we announced plans to exit our consumer operations in 11 markets, plus our consumer finance business in Korea. Since then, we have executed agreements to sell two of these businesses. Our Japan retail operations and our consumer business in Peru, and we have active processes under way in the remaining markets.","As we previously indicated, we will report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter. In 2014, these businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenues and a loss of $36 million, with the loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans.","In addition to these actions in consumer, we also plan to exit certain businesses in ICG, including hedge fund services within securities services, and our prepaids cards business in treasury and trade solutions. These represent non-core businesses where we do not believe we have the scale to generate appropriate returns. We are working to exit these businesses in a timely and economically rational manner, with a minimal impact on our clients. In aggregate, the businesses generated nearly $460 million of revenues and a loss of over 80 million in 2014. However, roughly half of the operations pretax loss for the year was driven by repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. We will also report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter.","Turning back to the fourth quarter, on Slide 10, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression and regulatory headwinds in certain markets. Average loans grew 4% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 3%, and average deposits grew 2%. However, revenues were down sequentially, driven by lower investment sales revenues in Asia, reflecting weak investor sentiment and seasonality.","Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs, grew 2%, as the impact of business growth and higher non-income taxes was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs were up slightly year-over-year and by 10% sequentially, mostly due to loan loss reserve builds in Latin America, due to portfolio growth and seasoning. We incurred a charge-off of roughly $70 million this quarter related to our home builder exposure in Mexico. However, this charge was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release resulting in a neutral impact on overall credit costs.","Slide 11 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 25% from last year, including a gain of roughly $130 million from the sale of certain on-balance sheet mortgage loans. Excluding this gain, revenues grew 13%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, as well as abating spread headwinds.","Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were flat versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans, reflecting the continued runoff of promotional rate balances, and retail services revenues declined 3% from last year, primarily reflecting higher contractual partner payments, driven by higher yields and improved credit costs. Underlying drivers for retail services remain positive, as average loans grew modestly and yields improved year-over-year.","Core expenses declined year-over-year, but grew modestly from last quarter, driven by seasonal marketing expenses and other episodic items. Repositioning costs were higher this quarter, mostly reflecting actions to rationalize our branch footprint. We continued to resize our North America retail banking business in the fourth quarter, all while continuing to grow deposits, loans, and assets under management.","Over the past year, we have sold or closed over 130 branches in North America and we have announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015. By the end of the first quarter, roughly 90% of our branches will be concentrated around New York, Boston, Washington DC, Miami, Chicago, LA and San Francisco.","We are focusing on our most productive branches in key urban areas and on growing high quality deposits. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, checking account balances grew 11%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $200 million, up 17% from just a year ago.","Slide 12 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remain favorable in the fourth quarter. In North America and Asia, credit remains stable to improving, and in Latin America, as I described earlier, we incurred a roughly $70 million charge-off related to our home builder exposure in Mexico that was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release. Excluding this charge-off, dollar losses were flat to the third quarter in constant dollars and the NCL rate would have improved to 4.7%.","Slide 13 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. We reduced our core expenses by roughly $160 million from 2013 to 2014, even while absorbing $100 million of incremental expenses related to the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. This core expense improvement reflects the significant progress we have made with head count reductions, product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Including roughly $900 million of legal and repositioning charges over the past year, our total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 56%, and pro forma for the announced market exits, the total efficiency ratio would have been 55%.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 14, revenues of $7.2 billion in the quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter were flat to last year, and down 17% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion grew slightly from last year and were down 5% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 6% from last year and 2% sequentially, as growth in high quality deposits and fees more than offset a decline in trade balances and spreads.","Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 7% from last year on lower equity underwriting activity, and down 15% sequentially, reflecting the comparison to a very strong third quarter. Private bank revenues of $666 million grew 11% from last year driven by higher volumes and growth in investments, and capital markets products.","Corporate lending revenues were $431 million, up 9% from last year, reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs, and down 2% from last quarter, driven by fair value marks on loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $3 billion declined 9% year-over-year, and 30% sequentially.","Fixed income revenues of $2 billion were down 16% from last year, and 33% sequentially, reflecting challenging market conditions, as well as seasonally lower activity versus the third quarter. The fourth quarter started with a volatile environment in early October, and ended in a similar way, with uncertainty around Russia and Greece, as well as falling oil prices in the last weeks of the year, driving increased volatility, wider credit spreads and less liquid trading conditions.","Overall, our currencies business navigated well, with stable revenues year-over-year and a moderate sequential decline from a strong third quarter. However, we saw a significant revenue decline in spread products. In particular, credit and municipal products, as we continue to support our clients in a less liquid, more volatile market. Our G10 rates business was also down versus prior periods, mostly driven by the uncertain macro environment in the latter part of December.","Equities revenues of $471 million declined 3% year-over-year and 38% sequentially, both driven by EMEA. Outside of EMEA, our equities revenues increased 24% year-over-year, with broad strength across products, and declined 18% sequentially on seasonally lower activity. In securities services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year on increased client balances and activity, and were down 4% sequentially, reflecting the impact of pending strategic exits.","Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over last year, and were flat sequentially, as lower compensation expenses and the benefit of FX translation were offset by higher repositioning costs, as well as higher external legal and consulting fees. Credit costs grew to $163 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an episodic write-off, as well as a reserve build driven by the overall economic environment.","On Slide 15, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, as lower core operating expenses offset higher legal and repositioning charges. Including roughly $700 million of legal and repositioning charges, our total efficiency ratio was 59%, and pro forma for the announced strategic actions, the total efficiency ratio would have been 58%. Our full year comp ratio was also flat to 2013 at 29%.","Slide 16 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year, driven mainly by lower revenues from sales of available for sale securities, as well as hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CCAR process. Assets of $329 billion included approximately $80 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $197 billion of liquid investment securities.","Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $98 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $5 billion during the quarter and $19 billion year-over-year, driven by asset sales and runoff.","On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings' financial results. Total revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up slightly year-over-year, mainly driven by higher gain on asset sales, and lower cost of funds, and down 20% from last quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt.","Citi Holdings' expenses continued to decline, driven by the lower level of assets, as well as lower legal and related costs, and credit costs continued to improve as well. On a sequential basis, net credit losses increased, as continued improvement in mortgage losses was offset by the impact of seasoning in the personal loan portfolio, as well as credit losses due to corporate loan sales. However, higher net credit losses were more than offset by higher loan loss reserve release.","Mortgage net credit losses were entirely covered by reserve releases in the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, 2014 was an important turning point for Citi Holdings. As we achieved profitability while continuing to wind down the portfolio and moving past our legacy legal issues. We sold our remaining Western European retail operations in Spain and Greece, significantly reduced our mortgage exposures, and positioned the One Main business for exit.","On Slide 19, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower cost of funds and our full-year margin was 290 basis points, up from 285 basis points in 2013. Looking to the first half of 2015, we expect our net interest margin to remain more or less flat to full-year 2014 levels.","On Slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 10.5%, driven by a pension-related reduction in OCI, and an increase in operational risk RWA. Foreign exchange movements had no impact on the CET 1 ratio during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was flat to the prior quarter, at 6%. And our tangible book value declined sequentially to $56.83 per share, driven by changes in OCI.","To conclude, I would like to spend some time on our outlook for 2015. We remain committed to delivering on our financial targets, including a mid-50s efficiency ratio in Citicorp and a return on assets of at least 90 basis points for Citigroup. We believe we can reach these targets through a combination of several drivers. First, we continue to believe we can generate low to mid single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp. Citicorp's full-year revenues in 2014 were broadly flat year-over-year. But in many ways, this understates the progress we're seeing across the franchise.","In North America consumer, we saw 3% growth in the second half of the year, excluding certain one-time items, as we moved past the difficult comparisons in mortgage refi volumes, loans and deposits continued to grow, and spread headwinds began to abate. In international consumer, we also grew revenues by 3% in the second half of the year, even as we saw slower global growth and absorbed significant regulatory and spread headwinds that we see abating somewhat in 2015.","In investment banking, we saw good momentum again this year, growing wallet share with our target clients and generating strong revenue growth year-over-year. And our momentum in treasury and trade solutions and the private bank was also evident, as we progressed through the year, with continued volume growth translating into stronger revenue performance.","In total, our current expectations for continued volume growth and somewhat abating headwinds provide good line of sight for revenue growth in these businesses, which account for over three quarters of Citicorp revenues. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment, with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.","Going into 2014, we knew we would face difficult market comparisons in the first half of the year, which was certainly true. But in the back half, total markets revenues broadly stabilized, even with continued challenging market conditions. Second, we believe we can drive a meaningful reduction in total operating expenses as a result of continued expense discipline to offset higher regulatory and compliance costs, the full realization of cost savings from the actions we took in 2014, and a significant reduction in legal and repositioning costs from the levels we saw in the past year, although on legal, as we have said before, nothing is certain until the matters are resolved. Higher revenues and lower operating expenses would naturally result in positive operating leverage in Citicorp.","We expect credit costs to increase in 2015 driven by loan growth, as well as lower loan loss reserve releases, and our tax rate should be in the range of 31%. We believe that Citi Holdings will stay at or above breakeven on a full-year basis and we expect to keep balance sheet disciplined, staying at or below our current size. We expect the combination of these factors will help us deliver on both our efficiency and ROA targets in 2015.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. John, I was hoping you could try to give us a sense of how much of the one-time items you had in the fourth quarter core expense figure of the 10.9 core operating expense. You mentioned a number of items that were either pulled forward or that you characterized as one-timish. Can you give us a feel for how much that might have been of the 10.9 billion core expense number?","John Gerspach","Well, let's focus on the $200 million. Because we basically \u2013 the guidance that we mentioned as of the end of the third quarter would have been that we would expected the operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. We saw about a $200 million rise, which I gave you some of the component pieces. I would say that somewhere between 50% and 75% of that 200-plus million dollars would be non-recurring, so call it two-thirds is non-recurring.","John McDonald","That includes the CCAR expense? Some of the CCAR expense?","John Gerspach","Some of the CCAR expense in the fourth quarter \u2013 overall in the second half of the year, we incurred CCAR expenses of about $180 million. And roughly two-thirds of that should be non-recurring as well. But that's split, John, between the third and the fourth quarter.","John McDonald","Okay. And any sense \u2013 ","John Gerspach","I would say, John, John, back up. Two-thirds of that should be recurring. One third of that is non-recurring of the CCAR expense.","John McDonald","Okay. Those expenses are in the 10.9 that that jumping off point in the fourth quarter expense number, correct?","John Gerspach","Yes. John, maybe what's simpler is if I took you through where we stand with delivering the repositioning saves that might get you closer to where you're looking to \u2013 to try to get to.","John McDonald","Okay.","John Gerspach","If you think about our repositioning expenses, over the last nine quarters, we've taken roughly $3.1 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions that we announced back in December of 2012. We expect that the, all of those actions should produce about $3.4 billion of annual savings. Roughly $2.7 billion of those benefits are already included in our fourth quarter expense run rate. Or maybe said another way, the fourth quarter expenses are lower by about $700 million, resulting from the cumulative impact of those actions. So these savings will continue to accrete each quarter and we expect the vast majority of those remaining benefits to be reflected in our expense base by the fourth quarter of 2015.","John McDonald","Okay. So if we actually tried to talk about it in terms of the 10.9 you're running right now exiting the year just under $44 billion in core operating expense. You hope to have that number lower in absolute dollars in 2015 with the savings building?","John Gerspach","John, again, we're committed to delivering that efficiency ratio in the mid-50s for Citicorp.","John McDonald","Okay.","John Gerspach","And as we said before, we think it takes, some low to mid single \u2013 low single-digit revenue increase. We need to deliver on these expense initiatives. We've got the path to get there. I don't want to get into an absolute level of expenses.","John McDonald","Okay. And John, in terms of the repositioning, unlike the legal costs, the repositioning, as you and Mike have said, are 100% in your control. So do you expect to have any repositioning in 2015? And should it be a lot lower? Could you give us any kind of sizing perspective on any additional repositioning we should expect in 2015?","John Gerspach","I would never use a word like we won't have any repositioning, because we're constantly looking at the business. But it certainly shouldn't be at the level you saw in, in 2014 where we had in Citicorp something like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion worth of repositioning costs. What we said, John, when we set up those efficiency targets, don't forget, is we said we thought that in a normal year, we would have about 200 basis points of our revenue consumed by legal and repositioning. So we certainly aren't looking to run repositioning anywhere near the level in 2015, anywhere near the level that we ran it at in 2014.","John McDonald","Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks John.","John Gerspach","No problem, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Mitchell","Hi, good morning guys. My question is on the strategic actions. There's a lot of moving parts there. And you mentioned, I guess number one that you expect Citi Holdings to remain at breakeven or better next year or 2015. But we have \u2013 you're adding businesses that have been losing money. There's the pretty clear that you guys are looking to sell One Main. Is all of that contemplated in that comment? How do we think about that?","John Gerspach","It's all contemplated in that comment.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Perfect. And then have you \u2013 can you guys help us a little? We can all pick our own guess on what maybe what the capital gain could be in One Main or anything else. But with all these actions, is there any kind of a way to think about the RWA reduction potential coming out of One Main, as well as the strategic changes?","John Gerspach","No. One Main has about $9 billion worth of GAAP assets in it.","Jim Mitchell","Right.","John Gerspach","Obviously, it's higher than that on an RWA basis, but I don't want to get into the capital accretion that might come from a One Main exit. As we get closer to that, again, that's going to be dependent upon which path we go down. We're obviously working a dual path exit strategy for One Main. And so let's think about which path we actually go down and then we'll be able to talk about what the implications are.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last sort of bigger picture question. You guys obviously are a global company that's been I guess a source of some fear in the market. How are you feeling about the international aspect of your business, the economies there, given what we're seeing with the volatility outside the U.S.? Has anything changed? If you look at consumer revenues in international, they are still positive, but she slowed a little bit versus 3Q and maybe that's just seasonality. You're still expecting growth. What do you see as the risk to that expectation of growth outside the U.S. and how are you thinking about it?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think the balance of where growth is going to come from, with the move in oil, has probably, or most certainly shifted over the last couple of months. So I think what you've seen is revisions in terms of many of the developed economies up and some of the emerging economies, and in particular, those that are most dependent on oil export as a big part of their economy.","I think when you take the aggregate of those two and add them together, you can look at the growth rates being projected that we're projecting higher growth rates in the global economy in 2015 than we had in 2014. I think when you think of, or as we think of the potential winners and losers and how that impacts our business, I would probably break the world into \u2013 or countries into one of three buckets. Those where there's a clear benefit from the reduction in terms of oil prices, those where there's a clear detriment or headwind that comes as a function of lower oil or energy prices, and then there's a bucket in the middle where it probably becomes a bit more complex. And that is where you've got different combinations of where economies overall benefit, yet you have governments that are quite dependent on oil export for revenue generation against their budgets.","And so clearly, when you look across the world today, the big beneficiaries are the U.S. They are Europe. They are China, Japan, India, and you could take that list forward. You look at those that are probably most negatively affected, countries such as probably Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria. The countries that I mentioned in terms of being positive probably account for an excess of 65% of our revenues. And you could measure that in 2013 or 2014.","If you look at the companies or the countries that are most negatively affected, those countries probably constitute somewhere 2% or less than 2% of our revenues. But that being said, I think we all have to recognize that it's going to create unevenness. It's going to create some uncertainty. It's certainly going to create volatility. And I think we all need to be mindful of that.","Jim Mitchell","Great. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt O'Connor","Hi, guys.","John Gerspach","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","If I could follow up on the low to mid single-digit revenue growth, just trying to better understand how you get there. I guess if the NIM's relatively stable and the balance sheet is flat to down, and obviously net interest income is about 60% of revenues how do you call it 2% to 4% of revenue growth, when half of the revenues, or more than half the revenues aren't really growing?","John Gerspach","Well, you've got that revenue momentum already in the second half of the year, Matt. So when you're looking \u2013 when you're looking at it, you need to focus on the second half of the year and the momentum that we've gotten. So every one of those businesses, has both interest earning revenues and also fee earning revenues. And we are seeing growth in those businesses in both the NIM, both the near, the net interest revenue, as well as the fee components. Some of it, when you take a look at the full year numbers, it's going to be masked a bit.","Don't forget when you take a look at non-interest revenues, a lot of that impact year-over-year \u2013 come from the mortgage refi boom. When you take a look at mortgage refi, that's fees, those gains that we would have gotten are in 2013 in the first half of the year. They didn't replicate this year. So year-over-year, our fee-related revenue from that is down, I don't know, 700 or so million dollars. So there's a lot of those types of items that are just buried in the results. But we're focused, we certainly are looking through the full year comparisons and looking to what we see in the businesses today as we're operating them.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately, can you remind us how the foreign exchange movements impact, I guess you said it doesn't impact regulatory capital. It does impact tangible book. Just remind us if that's the right way to think about it? And then why is there a mark? Why is that something that you can't hedge, because it seems like what happened last year, the dollar strengthening is something that might continue?","John Gerspach","Well, Matt, we do hedge. So let's start with P&L. P&L and we have had these discussions over the years. And there's a slide in the back of the earnings presentation. I think its Slide 26, that actually talks to \u2013 which is it?","Susan Kendall","28.","John Gerspach","28. Sorry. 28. I was off by two. That actually shows you the impact of FX on the various line items. So the dollar strengthening or weakening or different currencies strengthening and weakening has an impact on our revenue line, our expense line and our cost of credit line. However, as you can see in no individual quarter does it have what I would consider to be an outsized impact on our pretax earnings. And in fact, this quarter even with all the volatility, the net impact was close to zero. So that's, that's P&L.","When it comes to capital, we do hedge our capital that's invested in foreign currencies, but we hedge it with a view towards protecting our CET 1 ratio. And that's why, when you look at how foreign exchange movements occur they not only impact your capital invested, they will impact your assets. And they will also impact some of the assets that you have, such as the intangibles that serve, then, as direct deductions against your regulatory capital base.","So we factor all of that into a hedging program that, gives us fairly good results. And this quarter, with all the movement we had, the combination of our hedging program and then the natural hedges that we have resulted in a zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. However, because we do not hedge every dollar of capital, you will then have an impact through OCI on tangible book. But, if I'm going to run the company with an eye towards where do I have exposure, I want to protect my CET 1 ratio. I don't want to run an FX position through that ratio.","And so in a quarter where the dollar strengthens, we may take a reduction on tangible book. But I've protected the ratio. If I go the other way, if the dollar weakens, and we have had quarters where the dollar is weakened, then I may really enjoy the impact that it has on my tangible book, but it's going to destroy my CET 1 ratio. And as you know, that is one of the key measures of regulatory strength that we have. So we think that it's really important that through our hedging program, we focus on that CET 1 ratio.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That's very helpful going through all the detail. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","John Gerspach","Not a problem at all, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Guy Moszkowski","Thank you. Good morning. My question is very much a CCAR related one. I think to paraphrase, Michael, you have said in the past that you recognize that a qualitative path with a very, very ultra conservative capital return ask would not really be a win in your eyes. And I'm sorry if I've paraphrased you incorrectly, and go ahead and correct it. But I guess the question is, having now been through the process for this year and done the submission, is that still the way that you feel about it?","Mike Corbat","I think, Guy, we are aiming for, looking for, we worked towards what we would want to be an unqualified path, both qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. I think as we've said all along, capital return is something you work towards over time. But again, we think that our capital ask is the appropriate one. And when all the results come out, we'll obviously let you be the judge of it. But we've felt given everything that it's appropriate and it's right.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. And is there any change in the way that you would sort of answer that question versus what you said, say, at a conference last month?","Mike Corbat","No.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. I guess the only other question that I have today is in light of the weakening in certain emerging markets and you were very good about giving us a sense for where your revenues come from in terms of markets that are more and less affected by energy prices. But generally, given some of the weakness that we're seeing in more of those markets, what have you done on both the credit side and on the trading risk side, if anything to say increase the level of scrutiny and protection?","Mike Corbat","I think you saw back beginning with Gipson, I think as different challenges around the globe in the macro economy have presented themselves. I think we've come out and tried to be very transparent with what our exposures look like. I think in this environment, you can imagine, we continue to watch Europe closely. Clearly, Russia, and we can speak to some pretty significant reductions in terms of risk in Russia. John and I had both mentioned Greece earlier. And clearly, with what I described as those economies that come under pressure either from the broad perspective of just big exporters of energy and suffering that impact or those where governments are extremely dependent on the revenues from energy to fund public and social programs, we obviously have a very close eye towards those and we think we're watching from a risk perspective very closely and monitoring that.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Guy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Wanted to follow up to that, which is \u2013 ","John Gerspach","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Oh, hi, can you hear me?","John Gerspach","Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So one's a follow-up to the question we just had on just the outlook for economies where they are a little bit weakish. I know you mentioned earlier in the call, Europe, EM could be weakened, even though they are beneficiaries of oil pricing. And obviously we saw a presence in those markets. So if the top line is coming in weaker than you think in some of those economies, do you have room to manage expenses down a little bit more? I know you outlined you hit the targets at year end 2015 on the expense ratio. But just wondering where you might be able to pull some resources out if the top line disappoints.","John Gerspach","Betsy, as we've said, we're committed to hitting those targets. We think we've got some level of flexibility obviously, to the extent that we see certain countries or certain businesses, underperforming what the expectations are. And if our view towards the targets change at any given point in time during the year, we'll have that discussion with you.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then you mentioned at the beginning of the call about the concept of moving away from a confederation of banking organizations to a true global organization. Is the steps to get there what you outlined last quarter, which is just exit the 12 consumer businesses, or is there more to do?","Mike Corbat","No. I think we said as we did that, as we looked at the exit of the 11 consumer businesses, that the remaining 24 we thought were the right mix of businesses in the right places, with the right client demographics. And so we feel that the consumer portfolio is at a point in time today where it is, it is the right portfolio, the right mix.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Just want to be clear on that. Then lastly, there's some action taken today by the Swiss Central Bank. Just wondered how you're thinking about that action and how it impacts your business.","Mike Corbat","Well, I think there's a couple ways we think about it. One is a move of that magnitude and you hear a range of potential standard deviations moves, but it's big. And clearly, those types of one-off moves affect the markets in a couple different ways. One is there's P&L ramifications from the trade. I think there's also longer term ramifications from just people being surprised. There's talk out in the marketplace of \u2013 some of the high frequency traders suffering a fair amount of pain on that. We'll see how that plays itself out. And we've seen in these pockets of one-off volatility that it actually causes people to potentially pull back from the market and we see volumes abate as a result of those. We'll see, we'll see what this move does, but I think clearly, based on market reaction, it came as quite a big surprise.","Betsy Graseck","Right. I mean, from a competitive perspective, there might be some opportunities for you, or no?","Mike Corbat","I think there could. We are, as you know, a big player in foreign exchange. Our business in the fourth quarter actually performed quite well. We think we're well positioned. And if some of that pain is out there and people can't find their way around it or through it, I think we've got the ability to step in and potentially take share or potentially do more business as a result of that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I think if we take your target of a 90-basis point ROA in 2015 that would imply that Citi would beat consensus expectations for 2015. So I think that's the way of saying the market doesn't believe you if. I could just go down a couple issues, especially after page 1 of your press release that 2014 was disappointing. So first, on efficiency, just to be clear, John, you have $700 million more of restructuring benefits to go. Would that be in 2015 or over a couple of years?","John Gerspach","No. A bit low, Mike, not every dollar of that will be in 2015, but the vast, vast, vast majority of it will be in 2015.","Mike Mayo","And is that why you guys are confident, I mean, these are big moves in global consumer efficiency from 56% down to 49% to 52% in 2015 and ICG from 59% down to 53% to 57% also in 2015. I mean, what \u2013 you're reiterating that guidance today. What gives you confidence in addition to those restructuring benefits?","John Gerspach","Well, as we said, it will take \u2013 there's some revenue lift baked into at least our initial expectation. But again, it's low single-digit revenue growth. So we're not, I don't think, overreaching for that. But, 2014 was such a noisy year. And we did \u2013 it was impacted by $11 billion worth of legal and repositioning charges that I think sometimes that masks some of the progress that we actually made. If you look at 2014's results, let's take it on the operating results. And we had pretax earnings of $18.6 billion of pretax earnings.","Now again, when you take a look at the Citicorp level of legal and repositioning charges that we had, that \u2013 there's over $6 billion of legal and repositioning charges that impacted Citicorp's results. That's about 900 basis points of Citicorp's revenue. So if we had been able to hold legal and repositioning to what we would consider to be the more normal level, say the 200 basis points of revenue that we would have mentioned previously, if you adjust for those two things, take out the 6, substitute in the 200 basis points, the Citicorp efficiency ratio in 2014 would have been 59% and the overall ROA for Citigroup would have been in the mid-80s.","So it's not that we are that far away from the targets. Again, if you normalize for the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had this year. And therefore, we think that given those levels, the 59% efficiency ratio in Citicorp and say the mid-80s ROA for Citigroup, the combination of the steps that Mike talked about earlier, the low single-digit revenue growth, the continued delivery on the expense reduction actions, the careful attention to the balance sheet, all of those things should get us, and keeping Holdings at or above breakeven should be enough to get us to the \u2013 to both the goals that we laid out.","Mike Mayo","That partly begs the question. You said you had $3.1 billion of repositioning charges over the last nine quarters. You had another big hit in the fourth quarter. How much more should we expect of these repositioning charges?","John Gerspach","We don't expect to be talking to you next year about significant levels of repositioning.","Mike Mayo","Okay. As it relates to project Rainbow, which does tie into efficiency and also going from a confederation to a global firm, how far away are you guys in having your systems connect and finishing project Rainbow, which really stretches back long time?","John Gerspach","Mike, we are \u2013 as we've talked on these calls in some of the forums before, Rainbow is, due for delivery in completion. Again, it's not a one-and-done. We've been continuing to bring countries on, but it's a 2016, largely a 2016 completion date.","Mike Mayo","And then lastly, again, the math works. We can all, work this out on paper, but then it comes down to execution. Mike, especially after what you called a disappointing 2014 or results below expectations, is this the right team on the field? And I ask that because there have not been really major management changes despite some of the shortfalls. And we know what those were. But how do you think about the team you have on the field?","John Gerspach","I feel very good about the team on the field. As you and I have spoken, we've spoken before on the CCAR. At the end of the day, that's my responsibility and I look at these other things that we're trying to work and put behind us from legal issues, to continuing to shape and exit businesses and use repositioning to drive costs out of the firm. I think we've got the right team that's focused on delivering on our targets and delivering on behalf of our shareholders.","Mike Mayo","All right. I guess it's a different story if you were not to pass the fed stress test. Is that fair?","John Gerspach","I'll let the Board be the judge of that.","Mike Mayo","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. I appreciate --","John Gerspach","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello. I appreciate the earlier answer when you spelled out the different markets and revenues associated with the beneficiaries and the losers in the oil tug of war. Just curious, how different would those percentages look if we talked about it as a percentage of exposures versus revenues? Do they match up or are they pretty different?","Mike Corbat","It's, it's interesting that I pulled these a while back, but if you look, I talked about the four countries I spoke to, Saudi, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, which at the end constitute and again, you can go back and look over a number of years pretty consistently somewhere 2 to \u2013 just under 2% of our revenue. They actually, in each of those years as I went back and looked, as a percentage of our end-of-period loans are actually slightly below those percentages on a year end basis, or end-of-period basis. So again, those countries that I just talked about would probably have end-of-period loan balances of less than 1.5% of our outstandings.","Glenn Schorr","Great. Thank you. Just a quickie on CCAR. Did you remediate all the MRAs from last year? I know that was one of the contributing factors from the prior year. So I'm assuming you had a playbook that they said fixed all this stuff. Were you able to address all the MRAs?","Mike Corbat","We certainly worked to address all the MRAs. The fed will be the ultimate judge as to whether or not the MRAs were in fact remediated.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. In other words, it's not a black and white answer. So I've asked this of the other banks. I do want to get your color. Your disclosure on energy-related exposures is very broad. I think it includes petroleum, energy, chemicals, metals. Can we talk more specifically on what you would deem oil-related and how it breaks down in terms of investment grade, non-investment grade, collateralized, things like that?","John Gerspach","Yes, Glenn. We're going to provide more in-depth information on this topic at next week's fixed income investor review. We'll lay things out for you pretty clearly, but just to get the conversation started, we've got roughly $60 billion of combined funded and unfunded ICG exposure to energy companies. That's including those classified as energy in that conglomeration that you mentioned, PECM, as well as energy-related clients in other disclosed segments.","And that $60 billion amounts to about 11% of corporate ICG exposures, just to give you a frame of reference. And as with the rest of our book, the exposure is predominantly investment grade. Certainly over 80%, and as we keep on saying, it's reflecting the focus that we have on large multinational corporations, including the global integrated energy companies. From a geographic point of view, about three quarters of the exposure is in developed markets and the largest exposures there would be in North America and the U.K. And roughly 35% of the exposure represents funded loans.","So the ICG has just over $20 billion of funded exposure to energy and energy-related companies. It represents funded exposure. I've moved to funded exposure. And that represents roughly 3% of our total funded loans. And again, about 80% of the funded loans are investment grade. So that gives you a fairly good overview, I think, of the portfolio. Again, $60 billion investment grade, predominantly investment grade, 80% investment grade. Three quarters of the book in developed country most of that North America, U.K.","Glenn Schorr","Definitely helpful. I appreciate it. Last one, you commented in FX is pretty good, given the volatility. Rates I think was pretty good in general. And those two businesses are bigger pieces of business for you. And you commented the softness is in credit and munis, as you paraphrase facilitating client flow in times of stress. I know this is a hard one and I know you're not alone here. I thought with your business mix you might have had better or less performance down in FIC given your mix. Is facilitation \u2013 were there large losses associated with that in this type of environment? Or is it a volume thing? How much can we attribute to inventories? I was just scratching my head a little bit on how that contributes to weakness.","John Gerspach","The biggest impact that we had year-over-year, Glenn, really is in the spread products business. So and that really is a result of taking marks on inventory positions that we've got to support the customers. And again, I don't think, as you just said, I don't think that we're alone there. We do have probably a slightly different mix than, than many of our other competitors, but even within there, we've got a fairly large muni book, probably a little bit larger than with some of the other banks would have. And so that certainly adds then to the results that we're getting out of the spread products.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate all the answers. Thanks.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brennan Hawken","Good afternoon.","John Gerspach","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Following up on the question there from Glenn on exposures with oil, when we look at the last few years in DCM volumes in the energy business, looks like you guys have a bit more bigger market share there. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be a bit of a headwind for your DCM business here if we assume that there's a slowdown in energy-related issuance?","John Gerspach","Some of these things will certainly have impact. I would say that global energy has certainly been a robust area for the last four years and clearly, our investment banking franchise, as with other institutions, has seen significant growth in episodic business as a result from that sector. And you're going to have some impact for lower, lower commodity prices and lower equity valuations. That is certainly going to have an impact on equity offerings and IPOs. But energy, energy is a broad business, and some sectors are going to be impacted more than others. And so we continue to see bust activity in some sectors where we're a leader, and I think you'll see the upstream in the energy services sector certainly see significantly less activity. So we'll just see how the whole mix continues.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. All right, thanks. And then shifting gears to Mexico, there was some noise and speculation, color in the market on Banamex and the fact that there would be a bunch of bidders for it and such. Is that \u2013 is the reason for that noise because you all were having dialogue? Or is this just from companies hoping to bid for an asset if it happens to come on the market?","Mike Corbat","We rarely comment on things. And in that case, we felt compelled to go out and comment and say that we are not a seller of Banamex. And I don't think we can be any more clear about that on these calls and in the forums. I've spoken directly to it and the importance of the franchise and why we're so constructive on our position in Mexico and why we think Banamex is the right way to express that in Mexico. So we have a terrific franchise. We're committed to it. And we think there's very good things ahead coming out of that business.","Brennan Hawken","That's clear. Thanks. And then in equities, right, I know you guys called out the weak cash revenues in EMEA. But was there anything else behind the equities' weakness? Also, more broadly, is there maybe an updated plan for the equities business because it does seem like there's a pretty regular stumble in that business, whether it's derivatives or in this case EMEA or what have you. How do you feel about it currently and where do you want to take it in the next couple years? ","John Gerspach","We're committed to the equities business. And this has been a business that we have spent a lot of time working on. And I think the \u2013 outside of EMEA, this quarter we've actually got performance that shows the progress that we've made. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, excluding the performance in EMEA, the rest, we had 24% revenue growth year-over-year, in every other region, North America, Latin America, Asia all saw double-digit growth. It's not that there's just one region that's driving the action here. This is a good franchise. We have an issue with our equities franchise in one region. And we have certainly begun to take actions there. We've made management changes, beginning in the late second half of 2014 and we do expect that region to be a much better performer in 2015.","Brennan Hawken","And given the fact that it was so strong in other regions, were there some sort of risk management or facilitation losses there, or was it purely just volume-driven?","John Gerspach","No, it's a combination. We had volumes, and we had strong performance in some of our equity derivatives business. Asia had a very good performance in equity derivatives this year for one in the quarter. So did Latin America. So it was pretty broad-based good performance. Again, the one difference would be \u2013 the one exception to that would be in EMEA.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then last one for me, you gave some helpful color on the fact that ICG expenses, you took down the incentive comp. But there was an offsetting assumption to the deferral, deferred comp piece. Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on those changes? Was that tied to repositioning that you guys are planning? Or is it a change in the timing of the deferral schedule? Are you shifting to more cash oriented comp? What's driving that?","John Gerspach","No. It's a combination of factors, as so many other things are. And as you go through the year, you make assumptions both on the absolute, the dollar level of deferred comp that you're going to have. And don't forget, every country has got some slightly different rules. We also need to make assumptions based upon the level of forfeiture that we'll have coming out of deferred comp as people leave. And, we've got \u2013 we had slightly less turnover this year, in the non \u2013 outside of the actions, of course, that we instigated.","So we had to change the view that we had towards the forfeiture percentages and as well as the absolute amount of deferred comp that we were going to have. And so all of that we cleaned up in the fourth quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. Thanks for the color.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Duong","Hi, everyone. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just starting out on the credit, where do you guys see your net charge-offs going in 2015? And what would be the drivers of that?","John Gerspach","I don't want to get into any individual line item forecasts. Obviously, what we said in the prepared remarks is that the cost of credit is likely to increase. That's going to come from a combination of both. We're likely to have slightly higher NCLs. I can't tell you \u2013 just as we continue to grow the book, it's not because we see credit quality weakening anywhere. And we continue to benefit this year from loan loss reserve releases and that is certainly likely to lessen next year. So the combination of those two items will largely cause an increase in our actual reported costs of credit. But we don't see any diminution in the credit quality of the portfolio.","Steven Duong","Okay, great. Thank you. And just switching over to Volcker Rule on trading. Volcker Rule's been here since July. Are you guys seeing your traders maybe being a little more cautious so that they are not doing any prop trading? And just a follow-up to that, where do you see the Volcker Rule impacting liquidity in the fixed income markets?","Mike Corbat","I think Steven \u2013 it's Mike. We haven't been a proprietary skewed institution for a long time. And so I would say no, that we really haven't seen those impacts, that ours is predominantly a client-facing organization. I think ways that you're going to see \u2013 I think we've already seen it manifesting itself probably comes in the form of liquidity, that there's just things we're not in or there's types of trades we're not going to do, and in times of market disruption, I think the buy side finds it quite difficult to find liquidity in certain types of assets or in certain asset classes.","And I think that's a reality of some of those changes. And so again, we've talked a bit about that we're probably going to see heightened periods of volatility as a result of that. I think you're going to see more price fluctuations around certain types of asset classes as I think bank and broker balance sheets have become more refined and defined in terms of what they do, and I think that just manifests itself in just less liquidity.","Steven Duong","Great, thank you. And just last question, can you remind us in your Citi Holdings, how much of your home equity book goes to full amortization of the principle and interest in 2015 and 2016?","John Gerspach","We will update those disclosures when we publish the Q, but it's roughly $4 billion of HELOCs that become fully amortizing in 2015. And then I think there's $5 billion that go fully amortizing in 2016 and again in 2017.","Steven Duong","Okay, great. And just looking back at \u2013 in 2014, even though that's not that large, but, have you guys seen any \u2013 what the early credit metrics have been on home equity book?","John Gerspach","You mean as far as the home equity loans that that have gone to full amortization or just in general?","Steven Duong","Correct. Yes, just the full amortization portion.","John Gerspach","Just the full amortization portion. They have been fairly consistent with the results that we've gotten for that over the last couple of years. Slightly higher levels of delinquencies, slightly higher NCL rate. Everything is either on track with or slightly better than the assumptions that we have built into our loan loss reserve model.","Steven Duong","Great. Well, that's all our questions. Thank you again.","John Gerspach","Not a problem, Steven. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks. I'll follow up offline. Thanks, John.","John Gerspach","Okay, Eric. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I had a quick question on the revenue growth targets that you gave out there for Citicorp. What's the trading revenue growth assumptions that you have built into those targets? I mean if trading revenues decline year-over-year, can you still hit that revenue growth target?","John Gerspach","What we've said, at least what I think I said in the prepared remarks was that our trading markets will perform in line with the market. And so, we're not, we're not giving any view towards what trading revenues will or won't do in 2015. So we're expecting \u2013 as we said, we had basically flat revenues on those businesses in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We'll see how 2015 goes.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then just one thing in the North America cards. You've mentioned for a couple years ago that the runoff of promotional balances has been a headwind. Is there any way you can size what that promotional balance as a percentage of the total or may be say that when you expect to actually what quarter kind of the headwind will be?","John Gerspach","No. We haven't talked to that publicly. And I quite frankly, I don't have those numbers right in front of me right now anyway. It's not going to continue forever, but I just don't have it. Sorry.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","John Gerspach","Sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Chubak","John, I just wanted to clarify something that you had mentioned relating to the efficiency target of 55%. One of the things that -- ","John Gerspach","Hold it, hold it, Steven, Steven, Steven.","Steven Chubak","Yes.","John Gerspach","Mid-50s.","Steven Chubak","Mid-50s, okay. I suppose after applying all the adjustments that you had talked about relating to the strategic actions on a pro forma basis, contemplating some of the restructuring benefits, the majority of the $700 million that you alluded to, I still get to about a mid single-digit revenue growth number. And I suppose is the growth \u2013 the low single digits that you're referring to, is that off of the reported revenue base from this past year, is it a pro forma revenue base, which should include some revenue attrition as you exit some of those non-core businesses?","John Gerspach","It would be a low single-digit growth off of where we performed in 2014. You can pro forma \u2013 I'm not going to go into every \u2013 I can't help you with your model, Steven.","Steven Chubak","I guess the low single digits seems reasonably conservative, but if you have all the pro forma actions that are taken to drive that improvement in the efficiency target, it feels as though the revenue growth actually needs to be a little bit better than that. I just wanted to confirm whether that was the appropriate way to think about it or not.","John Gerspach","No, I don't think so.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Then just one more for me on a topic that's garnered some attention in the press relating to the growth in your derivatives book, at least through the first nine months of 2014. I actually wanted to just inquire as to whether you're managing that \u2013 how \u2013 I guess how much more growth you can support or whether one of the important considerations we should have is the potential risk that the growth and derivatives book over the last nine months could potentially move you into a higher adjacent bucket, based on the inputs that have just come out from the fed.","John Gerspach","Yes. All very good questions, but first, let's start with the fact that what everyone's been focused on is not the growth in our book, but the growth in notionals. And notionals, as you well know, really are not any sort of measure really of risk or necessarily of counter party engagement, net counter party engagement. It's a reference sum on which then other things are calculated. So we have been working to compress the trades and what you'll see when we publish results at the end of the fourth quarter is a reduction in the reported amount of gross notionals. Those are the notionals that we had at the end of the third quarter I believe were about 65 trillion of notionals. And that's being reduced now to 60.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Actually, that's really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one follow-up and then I'll jump offline. But John, I just wanted to confirm some of the numbers you were saying before in terms of the cost reductions that are currently in the fourth quarter run rate from the repositioning exercise, were 700 million. That's not 700 million of incremental cost benefit. That's what's currently in the run rate right now, with another 150 to come over the next year-plus. Is that how we should be thinking about it?","John Gerspach","More or less, yes.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much. I'll jump offline for my other questions.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Just one quick one for me. As the full CCAR process is now behind you, do you feel that the feedback that you've got \u2013 the specific feedback that you got on the steps you have to take in order to remedy what the fed is looking for on the qualitative side, was it more robust and specific this year versus last year's process?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think first, Erika, I would say that the CCAR process is never behind you, right, that the CCAR process is just part of what we do and how we run the firm. So we in essence put a submission in, but the process continues and obviously us wanting to continue to improve and continue to embed. I would say that we had terrific engagement from the fed at every level, from our onsite team to the horizontal work teams to Washington and so I think that the communication was quite good.","And, again, at the end of the day, our submission is our submission, but we feel like the communication is good and we felt that we knew what it was we needed to do and obviously, we felt like that we've accomplished what it was we set out to do, but more to do as we go into the future and I think as I said in my opening remarks, I feel good about our submission.","Erika Najarian","Great.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Susan, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.52 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we accomplished a great deal by executing against our top strategic priorities. We tightly managed our expenses, helping to achieve positive operating leverage in Citicorp, and we're on track to hit our financial targets for the year.","Citi Holdings was profitable again, earning a $149 million. We also announced the sales of the largest business remaining in holdings, OneMain, as well as our credit cards business in Japan, and our consumer business in Nicaragua. We have now signed deals to divest over $30 billion of the remaining assets in Citi Holdings, which were already reduced 19% over the last four quarters.","After utilizing $3.3 billion of our deferred tax asset during 2014, we utilized another $1.2 billion of DTA during the first quarter. This helped Citi generate $5.3 billion in regulator capital during the quarter, helping increase our common equity Tier 1 ratio to 11% on a fully implemented Basel III basis, and increase our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.4%.","The Fed did not object to our capital plan, so we can now begin meaningful capital return to our shareholders. This reflects the improvements we made in our capital planning process, as we build a safer and stronger institution.","We continued the transformation of our credit cards business, setting us up for growth in the U.S. with the Costco announcement, and solidifying an important global relationship with MasterCard. We've simplified our products, improved our technology, brought in new talent, and have built a solid foundation to invest in.","While some businesses, such as markets in international consumer faced revenue headwinds, we had solid overall performance from our core business during the quarter. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, and gained wallet share among our target clients.","In ICG, our banking business had a very good quarter, led by investment banking in the private bank, and treasury and trade solutions revenues were up as well in constant dollars.","In markets, as we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start to the year in parts of fixed income, including credit, but our rates and currencies franchise continued to see strong client activity, and equities was roughly flat to last year.","Our U.S. consumer business posted good performance, driven by growth in retail banking, and international consumer revenues were flat, but loans, deposits, and purchase sales all continued to grow, and some of the headwinds in that business should abate as we go through the year.","While I'm pleased with our first quarter accomplishments, the environment, both macro-economically and legally remains very challenging. Interest rates remain low, economic growth is uneven, and market sentiment lacks conviction. That highlights the need for us to continue simplifying our company by focusing on our target clients and markets, while driving our finite resources to where they can generate the best risk adjusted returns.","Regarding our capital planning, we're committed to building on our progress to ensure we have a sustainable process that satisfies the expectations we place on our institution; a bank with unique global reach. We recognize the need to keep strengthening the CCAR process, and are continuing to invest in our compliance and regulatory functions. Overall, we expect to reach a headcount of 30,000 people in these functions by year end, and as an example, we're very focused on resolution planning, and have 600 people dedicated to it.","We're maintaining discipline across our company, whether it pertains to our balance sheet, risk management, and expenses in light of the environment. I believe we have the right people in the right jobs to meet these challenges and our targets. As you may know, Steven Bird will succeed Manuel Medina-Mora as Head of Global Consumer Bank. Francisco Aristeguieta will follow him as CEO of Asia, and Jane Fraser will replace him as CEO of Latin America, including Mexico. Between them, these three Citi veterans have been in our company for nearly 50 years, and reflect our deep bench talent.","I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Leach, who is retiring from Citi at the end of the month. He's worked practically non-stop for the firm over the past nine years, and I know we would not be where we are today without him.","John will now go through the deck, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I'd like to highlight a couple of items; CVA\/DVA, and a prior period tax change that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned $1.52 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2014.","On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $4.8 billion, generating a return on assets of 105 basis points, and a return on tangible common equity of 11%. Net income grew by over $660 million year-over-year, with about one-third coming from our core improvement in Citicorp, and two-thirds attributable to lower legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings.","Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.8 billion, but increased slightly year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 10% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses improved, offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release.","In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year to $621 billion, as growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits also decreased 3%, driven by Citi Holdings, including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of last year.","On Slide 5, we provide more detail on first quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 2% year-over-year, driven by North America retail banking, and continued strength in our institutional banking franchise, partially offset by lower markets revenues. This growth in Citicorp was partially offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, mostly reflecting continued asset reductions.","On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. In total, Citigroup expenses declined 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by a significant decline in legal and related costs in Citi Holdings. Citicorp expenses grew 1% year-over-year as growth related expenses and higher regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.","On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. As I just described, we generated positive operating leverage in Citicorp, with 2% growth in revenues, and 1% growth in expense in constant dollars, and we achieved an operating efficiency ratio of 54%.","Turning to Citi Holdings; we were profitable again this quarter, with nearly $150 million in net income, compared to a loss of roughly $290 million last year, driven mostly by the lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $122 billion of assets, or 7% of total Citigroup assets.","On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars; revenues were roughly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression, ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets, and the impact of prior period asset sales.","In Latin America, we grew revenues in Mexico on higher loan and deposit balances, as well as a rebound in card purchase sales. However, this growth was offset by the impact of prior period divestitures in other markets. In Asia, we saw modest growth in our retail banking franchise, and wealth management revenues were stable year-over-year. However, card revenues declined as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. In total, average loans grew 3% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 7%, and average deposits grew 5%.","Operating expenses grew 2%, as the impact of volume growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs were mostly offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs declined from last year, driven by a modest net reserve release.","Slide 9, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 12% year-over-year, on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release, and the impact of a tax benefit in the prior year period. Pretax earnings grew 21% from last year. Total revenues were up 4%. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 18% from last year, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity, and improved deposit spreads.","This quarter's results include a gain of roughly $110 million on the sale of our Texas branches, as compared to a gain of $70 million last year, on a sale\/leaseback transaction. Branded Cards revenues of $2 billion were down slightly from last year as growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans, mostly driven by the runoff of promotional rate balances, and higher payment rates. Retail Service revenues grew slightly from last year on higher average loans, and improved spreads, partially offset by contractual partner payments.","Total expenses declined 6%, driven by ongoing efficiency savings, as well as lower legal and repositioning costs. We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the first quarter, while also growing our average deposits, loans, and assets under management. Since the beginning of 2014, we have sold or closed nearly 200 branches in North America. We are focused on deepening relationships with our target clients in urban areas.","Today, roughly 90% of our footprint is concentrated around seven key markets. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter, checking account balances grew 10%, and assets under management grew 7%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $218 million, up over 20% from a year ago.","Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favourable in the first quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained stable to improving; and in Latin America, the NCL rate increased somewhat from last quarter on a normalized basis, however, the delinquency rate continue to improve, which we expect to result in lower NCL rates later in the year.","Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 55%, including over 200 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. In the first quarter, these charges were minimal, and the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 52.6%, down from nearly 55% in the first quarter of last year. We currently expect to improve the total consumer efficiency ratio to 52% or below for the full year of 2015.","Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 12; revenues of $9.1 billion in the first quarter were down slightly from last year and up 27% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion grew 4% from last year, and 3% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior period on a reported basis.","In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 4% from last year, as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 14% from last year, and 12% sequentially, driven by strong M&A and debt underwriting activity partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues.","Private bank revenues of $708 million grew 6% year-over-year, driven by higher client volumes and growth in capital markets products, and corporate lending revenues were $445 million, up 7% from last year on higher average loans and improved fair value marks.","Total markets and security services revenues of $4.8 billion declined 6% year-over-year and grew 62% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by spread products partially offset by growth in rates and currencies.","As we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start in spread products this year as compared to a strong first quarter last year, with lower activity levels across distressed credit, non-investment grades CLOs, and municipals. We did see strong client activity in investment grade credit; however, these flows tend to come at lower spreads.","Turning to rates and currencies, client flows were very strong this quarter in both G10 and local markets, driven in part by Central Bank actions and a pickup in FX volatility. Excluding the modest loss we incurred on the Swiss franc revaluation, rates and currencies revenues would have improved by greater than 20% from last year.","Equities revenues of $873 million declined 1% year-over-year, as growth in prime finance was offset by lower cash equity revenues. Sequentially, revenues grew 86% on seasonally higher activity and improved trading performance in EMEA.","In security services, revenues were up 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operating expenses of $4.6 billion declined 5%, driven by FX translations, lower legal and repositioning expenses, and ongoing efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs.","On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57%, including roughly a 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges; and our comp ratio was 28%. Currently expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.","Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were down slightly year-over-year, while total operating expenses increased, driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. On a sequential basis, revenues improved, driven by hedging activities as well as the absence of losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities. And expenses were down as more regulatory and compliance costs were absorbed directly by the businesses.","Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $122 billion at quarter end, including $31 billion of assets, which had been reported in Citicorp until this quarter. Over the past few months we've made great progress in divesting these and other assets in Citi Holdings, including the announced sales of our consumer businesses in Japan, Peru, and Nicaragua, as well as OneMain Financial. We expect these sales to close this year, totaling roughly $32 billion of assets, and we have several other active sales processes underway.","On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. A significant reduction in legal and related expenses drove most of the earnings improvement year-over-year. Total revenues of $1.8 billion were down 7%, while core operating expenses fell by 13%, reflecting the continued wind down of the portfolio. And credit cards improved as lower net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net reserve release.","On Slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has begun to shrink.","Our net interest margin remained flat sequentially at 292 basis points in the first quarter, and was up slightly from a year ago on improved funding costs. In the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline perhaps by two to three basis points similar to the trend we've seen in prior years.","Looking to the second half of the year, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestitures, including OneMain and our Japanese retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly seven to eight basis points before using any part of the associated gains to redeem high cost debt.","On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to 11%, driven by retained earnings, and approximately $1.2 billion of DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.4%, and our tangible book value grew to $57.66 per share.","In summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter with modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, significantly lowered legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. We continue to wind down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner including several announced divestitures that we expect to close by year end. And we also strengthened our capital position, ending the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11%, and a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.4%.","On a full year basis, we remain committed to delivering our financial targets, including a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid-50s, and as Citigroup return on assets of at least 90 basis points.","In Citicorp, we continue to expect modest revenue growth in 2015. In consumer, we saw healthy growth in North America retail banking this quarter, as volumes continued to grow and deposit spreads improved. However, international consumer revenues were flat year-over-year. This trend should improve somewhat as we progress through the year, driven by continued volume growth, as we expect the pace of regulatory change and spread headwinds to abate in certain markets.","Turning to our institutional franchise, we saw good momentum this quarter across corporate lending, investment banking, treasury and trade solutions, security services and the private bank. Together, these businesses represent over half of our institutional revenues, and should continue to grow this year with some quarterly fluctuations. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment with a goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients.","In Citi Holdings, we remain focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven on a full year basis. Overall, we continue to expect credit cards to increase in 2015, driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases. And we expect to keep balance sheet discipline, staying at or below our current size.","Our first quarter results provide a solid start to 2015, better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning, John. I had a question on the expenses. In terms of the core expenses, trying to get a sense of how much of your cost saves you achieved this quarter are reflected in the core operating expense, somewhere at the $10.8 billion? Or I guess another way of asking, is that number sustainable and a good jumping-off point for expenses from here?","John Gerspach","Yes, John, as we ended the fourth quarter of 2014, I think what we told you then is that all the repositioning actions that we had taken during the previous nine quarters we expected to generate cost savings, annual cost savings of about $3.4 billion. And as of the fourth quarter of last year, about $2.7 billion of those cost saves were already embedded in our expense base. That left about $700 billion of annual saves to realize then during 2015. And in the first quarter we generated an additional -- just over $200 million of that remaining $700 million. So we've got some more to go this year, but we feel pretty good about the level of expenses that we're currently running at.","John McDonald","Okay. And is the first quarter typically high on expenses because of the seasonality of the investment bank revenues?","John Gerspach","No, we don't -- I wouldn't say it's typically higher in the first quarter, it's a little bit higher maybe in the first quarter, but pretty much, expenses stay fairly consistent during the course of the year, again depending on certain fluctuations or episodic items. You saw at the end of last year we had some expense growth associated with our focus on CCAR. So those items do give us some quarterly fluctuations, but again, I think the first quarter is a pretty good jumping-off point for the rest of the year.","John McDonald","Okay. And then, could you also just clarify the comments about the NIM, and then interest margin in the second half of the year, John. You're selling some businesses now have an impact on NIM, but it sounded like there might be some actions you could take to mitigate that?","John Gerspach","Yes, well, John, what we said even in the earnings release that -- not in the earnings release, even in the press release that we put out in connection with signing the deal for OneMain Financial is that our intent is to invest some of the gains that we get from that sale to redeem high cost debt that are used to fund the businesses. Redeeming that, that high cost debt will then serve to improve the NIM, somewhat mitigate the impact of the NIM loss from OneMain.","John McDonald","Okay. And just on a related point to that, John, I was hoping I could ask Mike a question in terms of the CCAR. Mike, you passed the CCAR, I presume you've heard back from regulators in terms of how you did, and maybe new MRA. Could you share any thoughts on what kind of feedback you received and what you'd work on for next submission? And then related to OneMain, is it too early to ask if the OneMain transaction goes through as planned, would you consider maybe making an off cycle request to add on to your existing approval, with an update for capital that might get released when OneMain goes away?","A - Mike Corbat","Sure, John. Starting with CCAR, I think it was -- first off, I should preface it by saying that not only we believe the industry or the submitting banks haven't yet received formal response in terms of feedback, and so we've gotten verbal response, but I would categorize the responses we've received so far as having put a lot of work into it, made a tremendous amount of progress, but on an industry basis the large SIFI banks have more work to do. We've recognized we have more work to do, and we view 2015 as an important year to do that. And Barbara Besoer, and the team are obviously committed to doing that.","From a OneMain perspective, it's early in the year. I would say, we're not big fans of going through the processes of one-offs, but let's get through the year and see how things go, and we'll make a decision at some point later in the year.","John McDonald","Okay. And the timing, expected timing, just as an update on OneMain?","A - Mike Corbat","Second quarter -- I'm sorry, third quarter, John.","John McDonald","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning guys.","A - John Gerspach","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a question on the big jump in the SLR, that seems to imply, if my math is right, that you made some progress on the denominator. I guess, first, is that the case? And does that have also positive implications for the Tier 1 leverage in CCAR when we think about next year, or is that just purely an SLR phenomenon?","A - John Gerspach","No, it's primarily focused on SLR, and we did make progress in reducing the denominator of SLR, that will have knock-on effects against other ratios. And again, it's just something that we are focused on. It's against all categories of the various SLR computation. And so it does have knock-on effects for other calculations.","Jim Mitchell","Do you think there's more to go there?","A - John Gerspach","Well, we're always looking to optimize. I feel pretty good about where we are right now, at 6.4%, but we'll always strive to run the most efficient balance sheet that we can.","Jim Mitchell","Yep. Fair enough. Maybe just a follow-up question on fixed income; you guys, and I think some others have mentioned a slow start, particularly in spread products. Maybe if you can give us a sense, you've disclosed the [indiscernible] rates and effects as a bigger proportion of your business, and some others you had a competitor today show significant, or decent year-over-year growth in FIC despite arguably a lower concentration in FX and rates and a similar decline in spread products. So I'm just trying to get a sense, was it really the issue with the Swiss franc, or just had a particularly bad, tough time in spread products; just trying to get a sense why we wouldn't have seen a little bit more of a improved result there?","A - John Gerspach","Yes, well, Jim, as you know, I mean when you're trying to do growth rates, or you're trying to do anything year-on-year, you have to look at the composition of both periods.","Jim Mitchell","Sure","A - John Gerspach","And so, if you go back to the first quarter of '14 that was on a relative basis compared to our peers, a very strong quarter for our FIC businesses. It was especially strong for us in spread products. The first quarter of '14 gives us a tough comp. Spread products, historically, have accounted for about 40% of our FIC revenues, but if I look back to the first quarter of '14, spread product revenues was significantly above that level.","Then, if look at the current quarter, year-over-year, our spread products' revenues are down significantly. They're down significantly to the point where the revenues per spread products this year are below the historical percentage that we would normally expect them to be of our total FIC business. So it's been a significant impact on us. And I mentioned some of the underlying factors during the prepared comments; lower activity levels across the distressed credit, as well as non-investment grade CLOs, and munis [ph]. So these are what I would call, \"Normal fluctuations,\" that you would expect in an uncertain rate environment, and just reflective of the lack of distressed opportunities.","Rates and currencies, just to segue over, rates and currencies benefited from extremely strong customer flows throughout the quarter, especially in our FX business. And that's why we said that, excluding the reval impact that we had, the modest loss stemming from the Swiss franc, rates and currencies revenues would have been up over 20% compared to the first quarter of '14. So I characterize the first quarter of '15 as a strong quarter for rates and currencies -- our rates and currencies franchise, but a down quarter for spread products. It's exacerbated by a tough comp backed [ph] to an extremely strong 2014.","Jim Mitchell","That's all fair. I appreciate the color. Just any more color on how things progress throughout the quarter. You mentioned as slow start, does that imply that things got better each month, progressive month?","A - John Gerspach","It was a slow start and things evened out during the course of the quarter, but I wouldn't say that we finished with a big upswing in spread products.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, thanks. Thanks for all the color.","A - John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","A - John Gerspach","Hi, Matt.","A - Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","Just from a consolidated point of view, if we look at net interest income, it was down about $500 million versus last quarter, is that mostly the impact of FX and day count?","A - John Gerspach","Matt, I missed you. I'm sorry, there was -- what was down, 500 million; I'm sorry?","Matt O'Connor","Sure. If you look at consolidated net interest income dollars, they were down about 500 million Q-Q?","A - John Gerspach","Q-on-Q, well, don't forget there is a two-day impact. The fourth quarter has got 92 days in it; the first quarter has 90 days.","Matt O'Connor","Right, and I assume some FX impact in there as well or\u2026","A - John Gerspach","There's going to be some impact on that as well. You can see the -- on a constant dollar basis, you can see the comparison in net interest revenue per day on slide 17, and as you can see on a per day basis, fourth quarter on constant dollars, first quarter net interest revenue is spot on with the net interest revenue that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Matt O'Connor","Okay then in terms of the outlook, I mean, you gave me some color on the NIM down a couple of bits potentially in 2Q, but we should pick up a day, and then some balance sheet growth, so those net II dollars should be up, I guess, as we think about 1Q to 2Q?","A - John Gerspach","I hate to get that deep into it, Matt. The expectation is that NIM is going to be down, as it has been every second quarter for the last couple of years, down two to three basis points. There's a certain amount of seasonality in that. You can see though, again, if you look back, as far as our net interest revenue per day, it stays pretty constant. So that's more of a denominator factor than anything else.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then maybe a bigger-picture question on Mexico. I know, it was a couple of years ago, there had been some de- risking there in terms of the credit profile. And then more recently, some control issues had been flagged. Just where are we, and, obviously, there's that change of management as well. How are you feeling on Mexico overall in terms of, both the new leadership that you have there, and as well as the strategy from the fundamentals?","A - John Gerspach","Matt, I would say we feel quite good. As you referenced, we made some material changes to management leadership in Mexico, both from an operations and from a control perspective and feel like we've got the right people in place. We did fairly broad-sweeping reviews of our control processes in Mexico. And as we've said, as a company, we are extremely bullish on the economic prospects of Mexico, and Banamex's position in terms of helping to fuel that growth for the country. We see a lot of opportunity in Mexico.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, just lastly if I can squeeze in. I assume you can't tell us anything more on the Costco deal than what's out there, but anything on the timing in terms of when you'll have more details to share?","A - John Gerspach","No, Matt. That will happen during the ensuing couple of quarters and we'll put those details out when they are available.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, all right, thanks for taking the questions.","A - John Gerspach","All right, thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Schorr","Hello there, thanks. So I liked the improvement on the efficiency ratio targets, and liked the commitment to the target ranges. Just a quick, curious question on -- I don't think of you as the biggest rate beneficiary, but it helps, but what type of rate scenario do you have embedded in there, or I like your tone from last quarter of, we're going to hit them, one way or another.","A - John Gerspach","Yes. You know Matt, as we -- not Matt, Glenn; sorry. You just overwhelmed me with what you liked, and I was focusing on that.","Glenn Schorr","We'll get to the [indiscernible].","A - John Gerspach","Yes, yes, yes. Look, as going into the year, what we said was that we were expecting a continuation of the difficult environment that we experienced in 2014, and unfortunately, I think that's where we're heading into; certainly that's the way 2015 is playing out. We weren't expecting to be bailed out by any sort of significant rate increase, and again it doesn't look like that's going to happen. So we said that we thought that our Citi core businesses could generate low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth this year just based upon the fundamentals, and that is, in effect, what we experienced in the first quarter, with a 2% growth rate in Citicorp.","So we don't really have any sort of significant rate increase baked into those revenue projections. And our commitment is to deliver Citicorp that mid-50s efficiency ratio, and then the ROA target for overall Citigroup, no matter what the environment.","Glenn Schorr","Very much appreciate that. A strong dollar didn't seem to have a huge P&L impact, and broke all out -- you broke out for us all the places that hit both revenue and expenses. It also impacts the G-SIB buffer, and I know those rules aren't finalized, but is there a way to hedge that, or do you give up P&L neutrality if you wind up hedging that as an either\/or scenario?","A - John Gerspach","One, I wouldn't even propose putting on hedges for rules that are not even fully baked in yet, so\u2026","Glenn Schorr","Yes.","A - John Gerspach","That's not something we're looking at. The difficulty with anything to do with the G-SIB calculation is that, not only is it linked to changes in the FX rate, it's linked to what 79 other banks are doing, and I don't know how to put a hedge on against 79 banks' activities. That's just not something that I know how to control at this point in time. From an overall, what we can focus on, what we do know what to do, is hedge the CET 1 ratio, and you can see, again, that despite all their fluctuations in the dollar, it had zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. We laid that out for you in Slide 37 in the back of the deck.","So we've got a very effective ratio hedging program on to protect the capital ratios that are significant. And you can see that once again, as you said, the dollar fluctuation doesn't really impact our revenue or -- well, it doesn't impact on net income performance. Again, we laid that out for you in the back of the deck as well. Whether the dollar is going up or the dollar is going down, it all nets out to somewhere of plus or minus $100 million dollars of pre-tax earnings.","Glenn Schorr","Yes, I appreciate that. Last one, on credit, which has also been great. I'm just curious if there's anything within, whether it would be Russia\/Ukraine exposure, or energy exposure that is getting internal rankings going higher, or should I say internal downgrades that we should be thinking about throughout this year.","A - John Gerspach","We've been actively managing the exposure, obviously, to Russia on an ongoing basis and -- excuse me I apologize. As you can -- As you have seen, we've continued to manage down the exposure that we have in Russia. The consumer business in Russia is actually performing, I'd say, better than what we had expected; so that's good. When it comes to energy-related matters, we gave you a lot of details as far as our energy exposures when we did fourth quarter last year. Well, we'll give you more details on that when we do the Fixed Income Investor Presentation next week, but in general, our energy-related exposures on a funded basis are steady, fourth quarter to first quarter. Total exposure is down slightly. We mentioned last quarter that about 85% of our exposure energy companies was investment grade. We had some minor downgrades in that, but I think it's reduced by a couple of 300 basis points, or maybe it's down to 82%, so it's still very strong.","During the quarter though, in connection with those downgrades, we did take about a $100 million reserve, no credit loses, but we did take a $100 million credit reserve and that you'll see reflected in the ICG results this quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Great I appreciate all that, thanks.","A - John Gerspach","Not a problem, Glenn.","Operator","Your nest question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, guys. On holdings, thinking about the $30 billion in sales that you've inked, or equivalent of $30 billion in assets tied to sales that you've already inked, how should we think about revenues and expenses that are tied to those?","John Gerspach","Well, when you take a look at holdings, we -- again, our commitment to holdings is to be able to run that business at least on a breakeven basis over a full year period, and we believe that even with the sales that we've got lined up for the balance of this year, we still should be able to produce holdings at breakeven during the balance of this year and into next year.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, all right. Thanks for that, John. And then, how about on the capital front, can you help us think about what potential capital impact might come from those deals?","John Gerspach","Well, we don't go into deal-by-deal basis on these things. Holdings, at the end of the first quarter has got about a $179 billion worth of risk weighted assets, now about $49 billion of those assets though are op risk assets, so individual sales are not going to impact op risks. So, say, you've got a $130 billion dollars of mostly credit risk, some market risk, but mostly credit risk, risk weighted assets sitting there in Citi Holdings, and if you think about the businesses that we've got on tab, including OneMain and Japan, they total as we said about $32 billion worth of GAAP assets, but on a risk weighted asset basis, it's much lower than that. They only account for about $16 billion worth of the risk weighted assets, and that's just because of the concentration of HQLA [ph] type assets that are concentrated in Japan.","So you are not going to get a significant drop-off in holdings risk weighted assets just stemming from the combination of those deals.","Brennan Hawken","That's helpful. And then, you mentioned, John, I believe a decline in trade revenues, we heard -- a competitor mentioned lower demand in trade finance, could you give maybe a little bit of colour around that business and what trends you are seeing there?","John Gerspach","Yes, I'd say that our commentary would be similar. There certainly is a lower demand. Some of the trade finance businesses obviously is in connection with energy-related type of projects. So when you get the price of oil dropping by 50%, you are going to have a significant drop in your demand for trade finance.","Importantly, what we're evidencing in that business is a discipline, we are not just going to chase volume at any cost, because chasing volume just doesn't give you the type of returns that you want. So we are maintaining good relationships with our clients, but shifting the business to, some to be -- we'll facilitate the deal, but not look to hold the asset itself, and so that has a reduction in our trade revenues for now, but we are maintaining we think overall market share in the trade finance area.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me, Argentina, we've seen a lot of noise coming out of the situation there with the bond payments and the like, is that just how you think about that market from here?","A - Mike Corbat","If you look at our franchise in Argentina, we just in actually 2014 celebrated our 100th anniversary of being in the country and it's a place that we've got a history franchise. Clearly, we're challenged that today, or if you go back to March 12, sitting between the district court ruling here in the U.S. and the Argentine government is not a place we want to be. And as a result of finding ourselves in that position, made the decision on our own that we would like to exit the custody business. And so, we are in conversations with the Argentine government in terms of trying to execute against that process. Many of these things are complicated, but we think that's the best course of action for us to take.","Brennan Hawken","And limit it to the custody business at this stage?","A - Mike Corbat","Absolutely. Limited to the custody business.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. Thanks for all the color.","A - Mike Corbat","Yes, no problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, thanks. One follow-up and one on expenses; just on the RWA discussion around Citi Holdings so to get RWAs down more significantly from here is that just a function of the U.S. first and second-lien resi portfolio fading, is that necessarily [ph] the next driver, or is it some of these others that are on tap to be sold?","John Gerspach","I'd say still the U.S. mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, you can see that it's got the lion share of the GAAP assets, and in similar fashion, it has the lion share of the remaining risk weighted assets.","Betsy Graseck","Yes, and that's a natural state over four years, is that how we should think about it?","John Gerspach","Well, we've done there some opportunistic asset sales. We continue to run that portfolio down. You've seen the reduction that we achieved in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that's a combination, both of pay downs as well as asset sales, and we will continue to do that where the economics makes sense.","Betsy Graseck","Sure, okay. And then, separately on the expenses which I would say looks fantastic this quarter, you indicated earlier that there's about [ph] $700 million left in the cost saves to come through, $200 -- well, I should say $500 million left, 700 beginning of the year, 200 used this quarter, 500 left to go; is that going to manifest itself mostly through non-comp lines as it comes through. I'm just thinking about it relative to the comments you made on ICG group, with the expense target going from 57 to 55, and a comp ratio of 28 looks extremely efficient already on the comp line?","John Gerspach","Yes, the bulk of the remaining annualized savings, and I want to just be clear, Betsy, that roughly 500, little bit less than 500 -- that's on an annualized basis. So you'll get that in the expense based during the remaining three quarters, but that will show itself. But the bulk of those savings are split between comp costs as well as real estate costs, because we got real estate actions that we've also got embedded as we continue to take streamlining actions. We're consolidating sites along with some of the personnel actions that we've taken. So you'll see it on both the occupancy line as well as on the compensation lines.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just lastly on the repo costs, you've mentioned for couple of quarters here that you would expect repo activities would be -- repositioning activities would be fading. We had a smaller run rate this quarter, obviously repo costs, is that the kind of expectation going forward here, or are we just taking a pause before you dig into the next round?","John Gerspach","Our overall guidance has been that we expect legal and repositioning costs to run about 200 basis points with Citicorp. And we said that was a pretty good target to go forward for 2015. So when you look at the overall level of legal and repositioning in the quarter, I think it ran something like a 175 basis points. So roughly in line with that 200 basis point target. Well, I think that during the course of the year, you will continue to see some level of repositioning; even in this quarter, while Citicorp I think shows a repositioning charge of one, there was actually gross repositioning charges of something around $30 million, but that was largely offset by the release of some previously established repositioning reserves from prior periods. But we still will continue to do some repositioning. But yes, we do think that the bulk -- certainly the largest portion of our repositioning efforts are behind us.","Betsy Graseck","And the 500 million is coming through roughly evenly spread next three quarters, or is it backend loaded all?","John Gerspach","I'd say that we got a little over 200 million in the first quarter. There's probably a little bit more to come that will be -- you'll see in the third quarter with the second and fourth quarter somewhat evenly split.","Betsy Graseck","Okay thank you.","John Gerspach","Very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I'm trying to reconcile two thoughts; the positive thought comes from the CEO letter, where Mike you say, all that we accomplished over the last two years has been in preparation for this year. That's a pretty positive statement, but then I've heard a few I think negative statements on the call; the ICG efficiency ratio was 51% in the first quarter, and you're guiding the 55% for the year. So I guess that won't maintain. Trading typically peaks in the first quarter. You talked about a lower margin after the asset sale, so is this as good as it gets, or is this a false start for Citigroup, or is there a lot more ahead?","A - Mike Corbat","Well, Mike, I would say that you're right, there is cyclicality to the business, but if you look at the quarter I think there's a couple of stories or a couple of themes in here that are important to call out. John talked about the diversification of our earnings base, and if you look at the banking piece of it, we had good earnings growth in banking at the same time offsetting some softness around parts of our markets business, if you look at what's going on in terms of North American consumer.","So we believe, and you look at the earnings power of Citi, and how and where we make it, depends upon certain revenue streams. Hopefully you see and believe that there's more diversity to what we're doing. And I think a lot of that's the work that we've done and continue to do.","From an overall efficiency perspective, and from an ICG perspective, we are committed to our targets. And yes, ICG did have an efficiency ratio of in the low 50s, but again we've got investments that we need to make in that business, and we can't be starving these businesses, and we're already -- when you compare us against our industry peers, we're already leading in terms of what we're doing. And by the way, when we talk of an efficiency ratio of 54% for the quarter in Citicorp, when you take that and overlay it over Citigroup, it goes to 55%. So it's not that there's a bunch of things that are away from that. So, completely committed to the targets, diversification of earnings, and I think a continued story going forward.","John Gerspach","Mike, let me just -- the other things, I just want to make sure that you picked up on some of the other things we've talked about, which is that, we did recognize that we had headwinds in our international consumer business during this first quarter as well. So in a quarter where we had headwinds in both our trading performance as well as in international consumer, we still are able to post overall strong results.","And as Mike said, I think that really speaks to the balance and strength of the overall business model. And we fully expect international consumer to generate growth in the second half of the year and return to positive operating leverage. So I just want to make sure that you captured all the positive statements.","Mike Mayo","Got it, that addresses the operating efficiency. On capital efficiency, Mike, you said that you don't really believe in a lot of one-off to buyback capital, but you can now repurchase stock, which is different; actually if you could let us know when you're allowed to start buying back stock, and also if you can buyback stock at such a discount to tangible book value, why wouldn't you sell off additional non-core assets? I mean if it was me I could -- if I could buy dollar bills for a discount, I'd be buying as many as I could. I mean I'm looking at my office, I'd be selling my water bottle, my stapler, you know, maybe my desk chair, I'd stand -- I'd do whatever I could to raise that additional capital buyback stock and I'd make the request to regulators. And the question before, why not take the proceeds from OneMain or anything else that you can sell for a gain and buyback stock right now?","A - Mike Corbat","Well, two things. One is we have started buying back stocks. Our permission gave us the ability to start that on April 1, and we did. So that's underway. And I think if you've seen, Mike, we've been very disciplined, and I think quite transparent in terms of the way we look at our businesses. And those businesses that over the intermediate term, we don't believe there's a pathway to be accretive to our franchise in the industry. You've seen us take action against those. And so we'll continue to review those, but we believe today that franchise away from holdings has largely positioned the way we'd like it to be. And if you look at the returns of those businesses, both institutional and consumer, they're accretive to our shareholders.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","A - Mike Corbat","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So John, I just wanted to start off with maybe a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the G-SIB surcharge [ph] calculation. Recognizing, of course, as you said the Fed's proposal has not been finalized, assuming the current draft and some of those FX considerations relating to the calculation, or [ph] not amended, can you maybe just speak to some of the actions that you can take to help mitigate the G-SIB score. And in addition to that, whether you have any plans to actually manage to a specific target and say, \"No,\" it's unclear whether you've moved up a bucket from the 3.5% to the 4%?","John Gerspach","Thanks, Steve. I'd say it's pretty clear that we have moved up to afford it to the 4% bucket. I mean that's certainly our estimation, just given -- again, given the change in exchange rates and everything else we'll get confirmation of that, but we're pretty sure that we're in that 4% bucket under the current proposed rules. And we'll have to see how those play out.","And as we've said, you saw some of the impact that we've had by managing down some of the components of the SLR denominator. And so, again, we're looking to manage down various elements of both the SLR and the G-SIB calculation. We focus on the OTC -- derivatives that are trading on OTC, the PFE associated with derivatives; things that we can control, we're bringing down. We haven't seen the disclosure yet, but we brought our derivative notional down another $3 billion or so in the quarter, $3 trillion, sorry. And so where we can, we will. What I don't know is what impact that has on the calculation, because I don't know what everybody else is doing. And I don't know where FX rates are going. So we will look to optimize our footprint, but the way the calculation is currently structured, I can't tell you that it will have any impact.","Steven Chubak","Have you had any dialog with regulators with regards to the approach, and whether -- it seems fairer balance giving some of those FX considerations as well as the fact that it's a relative calculation as you noticed?","John Gerspach","I believe that there were a series of comment letters already submitted to the Fed, and I'm sure that the Fed is giving those due consideration.","Steven Chubak","Understood; and maybe just one more on risk weighted assets, also follow-up to Betsy's question with regards to Holdings' RWA specifically; just looking at some of the 10-K disclosure that you guys provided, it looks like 30% of Holdings' RWA consists of operational risks, so call it $54 billion or so. And just given the long look back for op risk, I just want to get a better understanding as to what happens in an accelerated unwind of Holding? Should we expect that 5 to 6 billion of capital is actually released, or does it persist or linger because of the significant look back?","John Gerspach","Steven, so the updated number that I mentioned earlier is we would say that of the $179 billion at the end of the first quarter of risk weighted assets that's in Holdings, that $49 billion of that is op risk. And right on to your point, we don't expect that op risk RWA to dissipate just because we've gotten rid of the Holdings' assets. That will stay with us for sometime. I can't tell you how long, but it will be with us for sometime.","Steven Chubak","Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, John, and congratulations on a strong quarter.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Steven.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.","John Gerspach","Yes, good afternoon.","Gerard Cassidy","John, you mentioned that your deposits per branch here in the States I think were up 20% even though you've obviously downsized the branch structure that you have here in the States. Are you now at the optimal level in the seven cities that you've identified, or is there further reductions that we should expect?","John Gerspach","Well, we're concentrated around those seven cities. Are there still some branches outside those seven cities that we might consider doing some further pruning on? Perhaps, and there's probably other opportunities that we have to open up additional outlets in some of those seven cities as well. So the number 788 that we currently have, that could go up a little, could go down a little, I wouldn't necessarily just focus on it, but again whatever we do, we will be consistent with that strategy of concentrating our efforts on those seven urban areas.","Gerard Cassidy","Following up on your comments that you talked about with after OneMain is sold, obviously the NIM will come under some pressure, but you do get the capital gain hopefully from the sale, and you can pay down some of your high cost debt. Will some of the gain be also used for stock repurchases, or is it all just to reduce that higher cost debt?","John Gerspach","Under the CCAR, the thing that -- the CCAR submittal, we've already received approval over the next five quarters to buyback about $7.8 billion of our stock. And so, those actions are currently underway, as Mike indicated earlier, beginning on April 1 as to whether or not we would do anything specific with the OneMain gain, while it's probably too early to give you a definitive answer, I would not expect us to.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Early in your comments, I think you guys said that by the end of the year, you might have about 30,000 folks working in regulatory and compliance. Where's that number today?","John Gerspach","I think at the start of the year, we were looking at something around 26,000, may be a little bit over that. So I think in terms of slightly more than 10%-12% growth during the course of the year.","Gerard Cassidy","And do you guys have a ballpark and what that cost is, if you use an average salary of 60,000 or something like that for the folks that are in that division or that group?","John Gerspach","I'm not going to address the 60,000 number that you just drew out, but now I can't give you a specific cost of that. We've made comments that obviously the cost associated with regulatory and compliance efforts has continued to increase. It's consumed a fairly significant portion of the efficiency savings that we've been generating in the business. We've given you that math before. We've said that, of the $3.4 billion of expense saves that we expect to get in specifically of the now $2.9 billion of expense saves that we've gotten through our efficiency efforts, approximately 50% of those savings are being consumed by additional investments that we're making in regulatory and compliance activities.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thanks. And obviously, General Electric made that announcement about exiting the financial services business in a big way by selling couple of hundred billion of assets; is any interest on your guys' part and looking at any of those portfolios?","John Gerspach","I think as we've shown, Gerard, we're always willing and interested to look at assets at the right price, so, if things fit in strategy, happy to look at it, but I don't see us breaking into new areas that we're not already in.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just finally, coming back to -- John, I heard your comments about the G-SIB NPR, and obviously everybody has made their comments and letters. To your recollection in the past on NPRs, does the Fed ever come back to you guys, you and your peers for added commentary after the official closing of the letters posted and all that?","John Gerspach","I don't believe that is within the rule. They may seek additional commentary to other means, but I don't believe that while the comment and review period is underway that they can have individual discussions. But again, I'm not a rules expert.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Burnell","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just I guess administrative question, it looks like there's a really sizable increase in other revenue in your reported income statement. I guess I'm just trying to get a little more color as to what the change was there in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter?","John Gerspach","Sorry, Matt; can't do that one. I'll give you the usual line, if you call our crack IR staff after the completion of this call, they will get you that information. I apologize.","Matt Burnell","I appreciate that's a little bit in the weeds. Just to pull up a little bit from the weeds; you mentioned on July 24 that there was a transfer of a portion of a liquidity portfolio from corporate into ICG, at the same time you also increased the allocated TCE into that business. What was the size of that portfolio that you transferred and what effect might that have going forward on ROCE in that business?","John Gerspach","I can't recall the exact size. It was a fairly sizable number, something like a $130 billion or so. Again, we can get you the exact number. Again, that's more reflective of some of the deposit taking activities that are resident in the transaction services business. While we had the -- they tend to generate then high quality liquid assets that we hold, we were -- those things used to be resident in our corp other segment. And so, we felt that there was a better measurement to act from a performance point of view to actually push those assets into the business themselves. And I think you can see that it's had a small impact on the capital than attributed to ICG. That capital is up a couple of billion dollars from quarter-to-quarter. It's going to drive down their ROA. But we think it's a better measure of what the real ROA is that we have coming out of that business.","Matt Burnell","And presumably it doesn't affect the overall Citicorp -- that you are reporting and tracking again?","John Gerspach","No. From a Citicorp, or from a city group point of view, it's a right pocket left pocket, we just thought that it was a better way of measuring performance.","Matt Burnell","Okay, Thanks very much. That's it from me.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Q - Erika Najarian","Yes, good afternoon. My question have been asked and answered. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Hi, Mike and John. A question on just CCAR and the limitations, it's clear that CET 1 was not so much limited [ph] as much as Tier 1 in total. You guys have previously talked about raising about 4 billion preferred this year as a helper on that side of things. I'm just wondering just post this year CCAR, can you give us some thoughts about just the outcomes around limitations and any views that you might have that maybe different around the magnitude of preferred issuance you might need to think about for this year and looking ahead?","A - Mike Corbat","No, we still think that $4 billion is about the right level of issuance that we'll have this year. We'll give you further guidance next week when we conduct the Fixed Income call, but I don't expect that number to increase. The important thing about the CCAR, don't forget CCAR is an exercise that goes out over nine quarter. And so it's really what gets reflected in the various CCAR calculations is the totality of your capital plan, including issuances as well as redemption, the use of capital repurchases over that nine-quarter period. We're still comfortable with the guidance that we'd given as far as the level of preferred stock issuance that we need to do.","Ken Usdin","Okay, understood; great. And then second question, you spoke to the drag that have been impacting the international consumer businesses from the spread compression and the regulatory changes, can you talk a little bit more about just qualitatively the international markets, LATAM and Asia, and any impact you are seeing from FX not so much in the translation effects because that's pretty clear that that's a net neutral, but just in terms of the economies in general, organic and secure growth, and how you are feeling about those businesses? Thanks.","John Gerspach","Yes. I mean we still look -- obviously -- globally, GDP growth is less than what we would hope for, and I don't think we are alone in that, but we still see good opportunities in markets; India for instance, is doing very well. It's likely that India is going to emerge as the economy with the strongest GDP growth this year as it outdistances China, but we continue to invest on our franchises throughout Asia, and we are getting good driver growth, the deposit levels, the loan levels; so we feel really good about the strength of our overall Asia franchise. Unlike so many other things these are patches that we have to manage our way through, where you are going to get some regulatory headwinds, you are going to have some slowdown in GDP, so that might mitigate some of the -- it might cause you to lessen the pace of some of your investments in those countries, but it doesn't stop the fact that we are still looking to grow our Asia consumer business.","Ken Usdin","And then, last just clarification, John, you earlier had mentioned that maybe China offset, or keep key holdings profitable on a yearly basis this year into next year, and I'm just wondering is the potential debt pay down considered after the sale of OneMain considered in the helping part of next year as well?","John Gerspach","Yes, very much so, very much so.","Ken Usdin","Okay, understood. Thank you.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom","Hi, how are you, John? Just a couple of questions; first, as it relates to the Costco portfolio, can you just describe how the price discovery works on that?","John Gerspach","I'm not quite sure that we've released the contractual terms on that, but just to say that there is a process put in place by which a purchase price can be set between the two parties, and we ultimately feel that we will reach agreement on an appropriate purchase price, because we think it's in both of our best interest to have the portfolio transferred.","Eric Wasserstrom","And I guess what I'm trying to just understand is to the extent that there is obviously a difference in view on pricing, how does that -- what is the mechanism for resolution?","John Gerspach","There is a mechanism, and mechanism leads to a choice as to whether or not the portfolio ultimately is transferred.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay.","John Gerspach","Although we don't think that's where it's going to go.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. And then on a different topic, and there has obviously been some press speculation about legal authority and their interest in getting one of your legal entities to plead guilty to an issue. And I guess I'm not asking obviously to comment directly on that, but I guess my question is to the extent that, that does happen for your banking entity in the United States, how does the investment community think about the operational risk that, that creates for you? For example, does it create risk to your licenses? Does it create risk to certain counterparties who may or may not be able to interact with you on a go-forward basis? How do we frame our understanding of those risks?","John Gerspach","Eric, we don't comment on individual litigation or regulatory matters. Our specific reserving actions unless it's related to specific settlements that we are announcing and since we don't comment on these things because they ultimately are hypotheticals, I'm really not going to comment then on your hypothetical.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, I understood. Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Kotowski","Yes, hi. I wonder if you could just talk how do the redemption of high cost debt work, so just hypothetically let's say is that the proceeds or is that the gain that is the driver and how much you can do? So, if hypothetically you sell a business for $1 billion in proceeds and you have a $100 million gain, can you buyback a $100 million of debt or a billion or is the constraining factor, that is got to be -- the redemption cost have to be less than 100 million?","John Gerspach","Your last one, the constraining factor is the cost of the redemption. So if I've got a $100 million dollar gain, I should be able to retire debt that would generate a $100 million loss that would cancel out the gain and the loss, producing a zero impact on net income, and we would have the ongoing benefit of the debt being retired, therefore lessening interest charges in the future periods.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. And this is either presumably part of the CCAR capital plan or doesn't require specific approval for all that, right?","John Gerspach","Either one.","Chris Kotowski","Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. That's it from me.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, I just have one quick question; with regards to what you mentioned about -- potentially looking at some of GE's assets relative to your guidance at the balance seems to be at or below its current size over the year. Does that mean your guidance excludes any potential acquisitions?","A - Mike Corbat","We would say that there is something that we think is extraordinary and creates real value. We would certainly be willing to put that on if it's accretive in the ways we want a look at it, but the other levers we pull is that we've maintained a flat balance sheet while investing in our business in loan growth by the continued shrinkage of holding. So depending on the size of the asset and the nature of it, we might be able to create room through holdings, or if it works extraordinary or something we thought of merit, we could certainly add it to the balance sheet.","John Gerspach","I just want to be clear; I mean the comments that I made as far as the balance sheet size is related to this year. I'm not saying that we will never grow the balance sheet in '16, '17, '18; that was a very specific comment as related to the other comments on the balance of the year. It will be doubtful that any significant portfolio of assets we would actually be able to close on this year. So the guidance stays for this year.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great. And just one follow-up question; was there any gain from moving out OneMain and the held-for-sale?","John Gerspach","Is there what, I'm sorry?","Brian Kleinhanzl","Any gain from moving -- you said I think the OneMain operations have moved the held-for-sale?","John Gerspach","Oh, yes, no, no, no. There's no gain associated with the movement from -- into held-for-sale.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thank you.","John Gerspach","Not a problem.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Susan Kendall","Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations, and we look forward to speak with you again soon. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall ","Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; and John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Michael Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As you know, our net income for the fourth quarter and the year reflect the impact of the onetime non-cash charge due to tax reform and I'll go into some more detail about that after I discuss our business performance.","We had a strong close to an important year. We reported operating earnings of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $1.28 per share. During the quarter, we again showed growth in many of the products we've been investing in and increased loans in both sides of our house.","Globally, Consumer Banking was up 4%, including 7% internationally. We again had revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both the US and our international franchise. Credit remained favorable and net income grew by 8%.","The Institutional Clients Group saw continued momentum with double-digit growth in its banking products comprised of TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Corporate Lending. We did have a decline in Markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the US election last year, but engagement remains strong with our target clients.","For the full year, on an operating basis, we earned $15.8 billion in net income for 2017, which was nearly $1 billion more than in 2016 and our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016.","We also made solid progress towards the targets we laid out during our Investor Day in July as a result of our focus on client-led growth. Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year efficiency ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016.","We increased our return on assets to 84 basis points. Our return on tangible common equity, including and excluding DTA, increased to 8.1% and 9.6%, respectively. In terms of capital, we returned over $17 billion to our shareholders during the year and reduced our common shares outstanding by over 200 million shares.","Turning to tax reform. We believe it will greatly benefit Citi shareholders. The charge we're taking relates mostly to the reduction of the value of our deferred tax assets as a result of a lower corporate tax rate, the implementation of a territorial tax system and the tax on deemed repatriation.","DTAs primarily represent tax credits generated from losses we took in the US during the financial crisis and tax benefits from our foreign operations. These tax credits will be re-measured at a lower enacted corporate tax rate since the rate is being cut from 35% to 21% and, of course, we'll benefit from a significant reduction in our effective tax rate going forward.","While the GAAP charge is large, it's important to note that the impact on our regulatory capital is far smaller at about $6 billion. Even after this charge, we have a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.3% today, which is well above the 11.5% level we need to prudently operate the firm.","Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next 2 CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward. If anything, that ability has been enhanced by tax reform.","From a business perspective, it's a great opportunity to advise our clients on how they can optimize their models to fit the new tax regime. Everything from repatriation to supply chain is on the table and we're already engaged in these conversations with our clients.","The macro environment is as positive as we've seen in many years. 2017 was the first year since the crisis in which growth actually exceeded expectations. Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the US economy needs to drive growth higher.","The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates.","So on balance, tax form is a - tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders and will help us achieve our goals of improving our return on and increasing our return of capital.","We'll benefit from the lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income going forward. We believe the combination of higher income and reduced tangible common equity will have a meaningful positive impact on our returns, improving return on tangible common equity by about 200 basis points going forward.","We're revising the return targets we provided in July accordingly and don't plan on speaking to RoTCE, excluding DTA, when we discuss the returns going forward. In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.","With that, John will go through the presentation and we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, before we go into our operating results, I do want to spend a few minutes on the impact of tax reform on our fourth quarter as well as the benefits we expect going forward.","I would note that these figures are based on our current understanding of the details of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we will continue to refine our estimates over the near term.","As noted on the table, our fourth quarter results included a onetime non-cash charge of $22 billion or $8.43 per share comprised of roughly $19 billion due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets or DTA arising from the lower US corporate tax rate as well as the shift to a territorial regime and roughly $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of un-remitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. From a reporting perspective, the entire $22 billion charge was recorded in the tax line in our Corp\/Other segment.","The impact on our CET1 capital was significantly smaller at approximately $6 billion or a 40 basis point reduction in our CET1 capital ratio. Importantly, we remain on track to return at least $60 billion of capital in aggregate over the 2017, 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles, subject of course, to regulatory approval.","On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate, going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years.","And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our RoTCE going forward.","Turning to Slide 4. For the remainder of this presentation, we show fourth quarter and full year results excluding the impact of tax reform in order to better describe our underlying trends.","On this basis, net income was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $1.28 grew 12%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.","These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate, as well as a onetime loss in discontinued operations. Excluding these items, our normalized EPS was $1.20 in the fourth quarter.","Revenues of $17.3 billion grew 1% from the prior year, reflecting 2% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp\/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.","Expenses were flat year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning, as well as an episodic charge-off in our Institutional business this quarter.","On a full year basis, total revenues grew 2% in 2017, including 6% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks.","Our RoTCE, excluding the impact of disallowed DTA, improved to 9.6% in 2017, showing good progress towards our original Investor Day target of a 10% return on this basis in 2018.","In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other.","GCB and ICG loans grew by $41 billion in total with contribution from every region in Consumer as well as TTS, the Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending.","Our progress was broad-based in 2017 with revenue growth and positive operating leverage and operating margin expansion in our Institutional business as well as every region in Consumer.","In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth and nearly 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio. In ICG, revenues grew 7% with 200 basis points of efficiency improvement. Of course, our ICG results benefited from a gain on sale in the third quarter, but even excluding the gain, we generated 6% revenue growth and over 100 basis points of efficiency improvement in 2017.","And finally, revenues in Corp\/Other declined significantly year-over-year by roughly $2 billion. We expect the wind down of legacy assets to continue to be a drag on top line results over the medium term. However, the dollar impact should moderate going forward.","Turning now to each business. Slide 6 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 8% in the fourth quarter as growth in operating margin outpaced a higher cost of credit.","Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with positive operating leverage in both North America and our international franchise. Operating margin grew by 7% and we delivered solid improvement in earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially.","This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our Global Consumer earnings, which we expect to translate into year-over-year earnings growth in 2018.","From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards delivered 3% revenue growth driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region.","Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 2% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year.","Mortgage revenues declined significantly, mostly reflecting lower origination activity. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 14% driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity.","Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year with half the decline coming from lower escrow balances given the lower mortgage activity.","We generated 4% growth in checking deposits this quarter driven largely by our Citigold segment. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments.","This aligns with our Citigold Wealth Management strategy with assets under management up 14% year-over-year to $60 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products.","Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion increased slightly from last year. Client engagement remains strong with average loans growing by 6% and purchase sales up 10% year-over-year.","We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 4% year-over-year, excluding our Hilton portfolio, as recent vintages continued to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.","However, we faced continued headwinds from growth in transactor and promotional rate balances, which we are funding at a higher cost versus last year given the higher interest rate environment.","The growth in promotional rate balances reflects a strong response to our offers, generating growth in both spending and borrowing activity from new accounts during the promotional period.","We continue to be confident in our acquisition strategy and believe the investments we're making today will generate revenue growth as these balances mature. As we look forward, we expect interest earning balances to continue to grow while promotional rate loans should stabilize and then begin to decline in 2018 as we continue to take actions to adjust our acquisition strategy in a rising rate environment. These actions include shortening or eliminating the promotional period on certain offers while continuing to optimize our mix of acquisitions by product.","The combination of interest earning loan growth and the decline in promotional rate balances should deliver underlying revenue growth in 2018 in the range of around 2%.","However, this growth should largely be offset by the impact of additional terms that go into effect this quarter in certain of our partnership contracts. And as previously noted, we expect to close the sale of the Hilton portfolio this quarter.","However, this sale should be neutral to revenues in full year 2018 as the gain on sale is roughly the same as the annual revenues on this portfolio.","Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America Consumer were flat to last year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.","We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 21% growth among mobile users versus last year.","Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 7% year-over-year and we built roughly $150 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios.","Our NCL rate in US branded cards was 289 basis points for full year 2017. We remain comfortable with an NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points for 2018 and up to 325 basis points over the medium term.","And retail services - and in retail services, our full year NCL rate was 473 basis points. This is consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 500 basis points for 2018 and up to 525 basis points over the medium term.","On Slide 8, we show our results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline. Fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew by 7% with contribution from every business and region.","In Latin America, total Consumer revenues grew 6%. This growth rate accelerated from 4% in the third quarter on better momentum across both retail banking and cards.","Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the fourth quarter with broad-based volume growth across deposits, commercial loans and personal loans, as well as improved deposit spreads. And card revenue growth improved to 4% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans.","We're achieving revenue growth in cards somewhat earlier than we had planned and this should contribute to an acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues as we go in into 2018.","Turning to Asia. Total Consumer revenues grew 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Retail banking grew 5% driven by our Wealth Management business, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. And card revenues grew by 11%, reflecting continued growth in average loans and purchase sales as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business.","Excluding the gain, card revenues increased by 7% in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, Asia Consumer revenues grew by 5% in 2017 and 4%, excluding NIMs [ph]. In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.","Slide 9 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. The NCL rate improved sequentially in both North America and Asia.","And in Latin America, the sequential increase in the NCL rate reflected an episodic commercial charge-off while delinquencies continued to improve.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.1 billion declined 1% from last year as continued strong momentum in Banking and Securities Services were offset by a decline in Markets revenues.","Total Banking revenues of $4.7 million grew 11%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.2 billion were up 9%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 10% from last year with wallet share gains for the year across debt and equity underwriting and M&A. Private Bank revenues of $771 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $509 million were up 14%, reflecting lower hedging costs as well as loan growth.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.4 billion declined 17% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.4 billion declined 18%, reflecting continued low volatility as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment last year in the wake of the US elections.","Equities revenues were down 23%, mostly driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. Excluding this item, Equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives, while investor client engagement remains strong. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 14% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.","Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation. And finally, credit costs were $267 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by the same single client event, while overall portfolio quality remains strong.","For the full year 2017, our net income grew 16% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline. We generated over half of our revenues in Banking, which grew 12% on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking, the Private Bank and Corporate Lending.","Securities Services grew 8% as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment. And we deepened our relationships in Markets as well.","In Fixed Income, while the trading environment proved to be challenging this year with low volatility and fewer macro catalysts, we continued to see strong engagement with our corporate clients as they leveraged our global network, particularly in rates and currencies.","And in Equities, we made solid progress with our target investor clients, improving wallet share and growing client balances in line with our investment plans.","Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $746 million declined 13% from last year driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 24% also reflecting the wind down as well as lower legal expenses.","And the pretax loss in Corp\/Other was $66 million this quarter, better than our outlook, mostly due to higher than expected hedging-related revenues in Treasury. However, we continue to believe an outlook for pretax losses of $250 million to $300 million per quarter in Corp\/Other is a fair run rate to expect through 2018.","Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp\/Other.","As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter was essentially flat to last year. Core accrual revenues grew year-over-year by over $500 million in the fourth quarter, in line with our outlook, but this was offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.","On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by $2 billion over 2016, again, in line with our outlook. This was offset by a roughly $800 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corp\/Other.","And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year with about 2\/3 of this decline coming from higher wholesale funding costs. As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year-over-year driven by loan growth, mix improvement and the benefit of higher rates assuming one additional Fed rate increase mid year.","Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million during the year as we continue to wind down that portfolio. And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment.","On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. In the fourth quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3% driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform, which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40 basis point impact.","Our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 6.7% and our tangible book value per share declined to $60.40, including the full impact of the $22 billion non-cash charge related to tax reform.","In summary, we made good progress in 2017 with broad based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders.","Importantly, we continued to deepen our client relationships and lay the foundation for sustainable client led growth and steady improvement in returns over time. We remain committed to our medium and longer term return targets and expect to show continued progress in 2018.","For the full year 2018, we expect top line growth broadly in line with the medium term outlook we described in July at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.","We expect to achieve another 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio on a like-for-like basis, keeping in mind that we just adopted new rules on revenue recognition that will gross up both revenues and expenses by about $800 million annually with no impact on earnings.","Credit costs should continue to grow, but more driven by the normalization of credit in ICG this year, having already absorbed material LLR builds in Consumer in 2017. And in total, operating margin expansion should drive improvement in earnings before tax across the firm.","In addition, as I noted earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 25% in 2018 with line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years. This combination of higher earnings before tax, continued capital return and the impact of tax reform is expected to drive a significant improvement in RoTCE in 2018.","As Mike noted earlier, given that our disallowed DTA is much smaller now post-tax reform, we'll no longer speak to our returns ex-DTA, but rather on the full amount of our TCE.","Excluding the impact of tax reform, our return on total tangible common equity improved to roughly 8% in 2017 and we expect to make additional progress this year. So including the impact of tax reform, which benefits our returns by an estimated 200 basis points, we should be able to generate an RoTCE approaching 10.5% in 2018.","Of course, this sets us on a path to exceed our original targets for 2019 and 2020 as well with the estimated benefit of tax reform moving those return targets up to roughly 12% and at least 13%, respectively.","What we described at Investor Day was a balanced achievable plan that did not rely heavily on macro or regulatory tailwinds or on any single business and we believe we are as well positioned now as ever to deliver results through 2020 and beyond.","In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger with all major global markets having returned to growth and the US poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime. Higher GDP growth or additional US interest rate hikes beyond the one we have embedded in this year's plan would provide a tailwind for us.","We also had two more quarters of operating performance behind us, extending our track record in areas like TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Securities Services and ICG. We're continuing to see progress in Equities and have extended our leadership in Fixed Income in a difficult market.","In Global Consumer, we finished with a very strong second half in Asia and we returned to growth in Mexico cards earlier than we had planned, giving us confidence that we can accelerate our overall revenue growth in Mexico.","In the US, while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold Wealth Management investment and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook. We also demonstrated strong expense discipline and overall credit remains benign.","Turning to the tax rate. As I noted earlier, we believe we have line of sight to reducing our effective tax rate to 24% over the next two years and, if you look at what was embedded in our Investor Day outlook, we had assumed our effective tax rate would tick up over time to around 33% by 2020.","So by 2020, we now see the potential for a roughly 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate. This gives us even more confidence in our ability to generate and return capital.","Despite the charge we took for tax reform, our capital position remains strong and we are on track to return at least $60 billion in capital over the 2017, '18 and '19 CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval.","And while there are lots of moving pieces, we believe our ability to generate regulatory capital has only improved post tax reform as higher net income should more than offset any reduction in our annual DTA utilization.","This brings me to my final takeaway, which is our confidence in steadily improving our RoTCE. As we said before, we believe we are in a unique position to improve our return on capital while also increasing our return of capital for a powerful impact on RoTCE, and we are committed to showing you progress each year as we move forward.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Good morning. John, I was wondering on the net interest income outlook, the core accrual NII for $2.5 billion that assumes one rate hike. So many folks are assuming more rate hikes for this year, 2 or 3, sometimes 4.","How much would your outlook for net interest income increase if we saw 2 or 3 hikes rather than the one you've embedded in your outlook?","John Gerspach","Yes. I think the rule of thumb, John, would be that for each additional quarter that we had an incremental 25 basis point rate - impact of - a Fed rate hike, we should see an increment of about $80 million of core interest revenue.","So just if we got a rate hike in March of 25 basis points and then we still got that midyear rate hike, that would give you 3 quarters of additional rates - of additional 25 basis point rate hikes so that should would translate to $240 million, $250 million of additional core accrual NIM - NIR, sorry.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the card revenues, I guess, first, on the US branded card. You mentioned that the revenue growth of 2% in 2018 will be offset by certain partnership renewals. Can you just mention what's going on with the renewals there?","And then also, should revenue growth be accelerating towards the end of '18 as the promo balances start to wear off, the core balances start to grow? And when could we see the kind of unencumbered revenue growth start to show itself? Is that a '19 story? What are your thoughts there?","John Gerspach","Yes. When you think in terms of the dampening of some of the new terms, I think when we, for instance, just to point to one example, when we renewed the American contract a couple of years ago, we talked to the fact that there was some additional revenue sharing that came into play beginning in 2018. That certainly is a contributing factor to what I'm talking about here as far as this dampening effect.","As far as the acceleration of revenue, yes, the expectation would be revenue growth should be - should accelerate in the tail half, the second half of 2018 and then be fully visible from a full year point of view in 2019. Again, all excluding the impact that you're going to see quarter to quarter as a result of the sale of the Hilton portfolio.","John McDonald","Okay. And then, on the International Consumer, it looks like both Latin America and Asia Consumer revenues have accelerated and are showing good momentum. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and that inflection in Mexico Consumer, as well as Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the International Consumer front?","John Gerspach","Yes. I'd say that from a medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day.","But with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico cards. For about 6 quarters in a row, we saw declining revenue growth year-over-year in cards. We began earlier this year to see that year-over-year revenue shortfall decline. It was lessening, but we wouldn't think that we were going to return to year-over-year revenue growth until the fourth quarter of this year.","As we talked last quarter, we actually saw the third quarter produce 2% year-over-year growth in our Mexico cards revenues and now that has accelerated to 4% here in the fourth quarter.","So again, that just demonstrates to us that we're on that path then to deliver the overall revenue growth that we have built into those medium term outlooks for cards in Mexico, which was in that 9%, 10% range. So it's moving forward really well.","John McDonald","Got you. Okay. And you mentioned overall, even with US card being a little light, your overall Consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?","John Gerspach","Yes. If you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S. branded cards over the 3.5-year period was going to be 3%. That probably comes down to 2% just given the fact that 2018 is likely going to be a flat revenue year.","At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think a 1% compound annual growth rate built in and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate. And then, there's some additional strength coming in, in retail banking as a result of the Citi - the strong Citigold offering that we've got.","So all in all, we feel good about it. It builds on what Mike said earlier. We weren't reliant on any one product or any one region. And so I don't think it's unusual that you're going to see some, you know, there'll be some gains in one product and a shortfall in others, but overall, still in line.","John McDonald","Got it. Thanks.","John Gerspach","Overall, still inline.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning.","Michael Corbat","Hi, Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Just maybe on the efficiency ratio, I think you've got it to about 100 basis point improvement in '18, but I think the target for 2020 is the low 50s and 100 basis points will get you closer to, I guess, 57.","So it seems to imply that there's some back-ended acceleration and efficiency improvement. Is that the right way to think about it and where is that coming from in '19 and in '20?","John Gerspach","Yes. It - everything that we're talking about right now is clearly in line. We never gave - with what we put up in Investor Day. I don't think we ever talked about a very specific 2018 goal at that point, but getting another 100 basis point reduction fits in with the pace that we had built into that Investor Day presentation.","So again, there's nothing here that is different. We're continuing to see gains coming out of the investments that we're making in digital and consumer. You've seen, I think, the result of that as far as on the impact on the operating efficiency improvement that we've seen in Consumer. And you can see the improvement that we're getting in ICG.","I'd say that there's still some process reengineering work to go through with our global functions and there's some additional work that we'll get out of our core infrastructure when - from a technology point of view. Those are going to require some additional effort in 2018 before you begin to see the results of that coming into play in '19 and '20.","Jim Mitchell","That's what I was trying to get at. There's still some - there's - potentially as you kind of -- the investments start to trail off and you get these process improvements, you might see more of a step down in '19 or '20?","John Gerspach","Yes, which is why we put forward the guidance of low 50s by 2020.","Jim Mitchell","And is that somewhat tied to the investment in Mexico as that finally kind of rolls off maybe in '19 and '20 as well, so that's how we should think about that?","John Gerspach","Well, the investment in Mexico, again, that's sort of embedded in what I was talking about with the Consumer. And, again, that will ramp up over time just as you make the investment, you don't get the immediate payback, right. It's only if you put investment dollars to work in 2017, you'll get some benefit in '18. You'll get even more benefit coming out of that in '19 and '20.","But there's also reengineering in some of our, I'm going to call core infrastructure. It's our global functions, whether that be compliance, finance, risk. There's still work that we can do there, and we should start to see, again, an increased benefit coming out of those types of activities in '19 and '20.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one quickie on the DTA. It looks like you still have about $13 billion deducted from CET1. Should we expect the pace of utilization to be slower with the lower tax rate? How do we think about that $13 billion going away over time?","John Gerspach","Yes. The - again, we're still going through a lot of this work, right? But where we are right now, while our DTA - the disallowed DTA was basically cut in half, actually more than half, $28 billion down to $13 billion, our current assessment would be that our DTA - our annual DTA utilization is basically reduced by about 1\/3.","So we had told you that we expect DTA utilization of about $2 billion a year that would be accretive to the capital base. And so now that's more in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, so, again, still contributing to the overall capital.","So we picked up 900 basis points of benefit in our effective tax rate and only lost $600 million, $650 million worth of DTA utilization in any given year. All in all, a pretty good trade-off and that gives you some idea as that - why we're seeing - why we're talking about this strong improvement in our overall ability to generate and, therefore, return capital.","Jim Mitchell","Absolutely. Okay, thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hello.","John Gerspach","Hi.","Glenn Schorr","One easy one, I think, at first. I appreciate the 200 basis point boost to the return on tangible targets. Is it simple math? Can I think about that EPS range that you talked about going up by a similar percentage?","John Gerspach","Yes, you can, Glenn. I mean, again, it's -- and I realize that it's simple math. We're actually -- if you do -- if you continue to do the math, though, I talked about the fact that we're getting a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate in 2020. And if you actually do the math on that, you're going to scratch your head and say, well, wait a minute, this looks like a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate should actually drive a much higher improvement to RoTCE than the 200 basis points that Mike and John are talking about.","And the math would suggest that it's probably closer to a 300 basis point improvement in RoTCE in 2020. But again, we're still working through a lot of the details and trying to assess what we might want to do with regard to additional investments, deploying additional capital for some clients, business expansion, et cetera, et cetera. So there's actually some dry powder above that 200 basis points right now, and we'll get more specific with you as 2018 continues.","Glenn Schorr","I definitely appreciate that. It touches on the ability to hit, I guess, a double-digit EPS number from this quarter's sub $5. It's pretty powerful growth. Okay. Can we talk about the revenue yields in both retail services and Citi branded cards has been falling?","It's clearly - well, I don't want to put words in your mouth. How much of it relates towards the teaser and the promotional books and the transactor books? And does that run off with the same comments, at the same pace as you talked about, the revenue improvement?","John Gerspach","Yes. Broadly, the - we would expect that NIR in branded cards to also improve - the NIR percentage to improve in the back end of this year, 2018, and then continue to show improvement on a full year basis in 2019.","And it is that combination, Glenn, that you were talking about as far as even as we're seeing growth in the interest earning balances, we do have that drag from promotional balances.","Glenn Schorr","Got you. Okay. Last one. Average loan growth in ICG was good, 8%, and I think no matter what form it comes in is typically pretty good. I'm just curious how much of it we should think of as like facilitation loans, things like Aramco, things like hedge fund leverage, which are good things, I don't want to make it like they're bad, versus a traditional corporate borrowing money and building something. Just curious on that type of mix?","John Gerspach","Yes, I mean, there's certainly some element of episodic lending in that loan growth. But the bulk of it, and I just don't have a percentage in my mind, whether it's 2\/3 or thereabouts or even 3\/4, is really what you would consider to be, I guess, normal ongoing lending arrangements, just straight-on commercial loans, loans in the private bank, trade loans in TTS, et cetera, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel good about that loan growth in ICG.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks very much, John.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","I want to follow up on the 3% revenue growth outlook for 2018. I'm just - including the net interest income guide. It seems like its implying flattish fee revenues if we kind of just take the math literally.","I'm wondering why fees aren't expected to grow, if that is the right interpretation, and then just some of the puts and takes on the fee business.","John Gerspach","I don't have my line item detail on 2018, but I don't think you're getting to the right conclusion.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes in the fee business, where you do think there'll be some growth and then where you do think there'll be some challenges?","John Gerspach","Well, we continue to see strong fee growth in our TTS business, just to name one, both in cash fees as well as from the commercial cards business. So we've been getting strong fee growth in there. Sorry, Matt, I just can't go down line item detail by business in my head.","Michael Corbat","Yes. But I think, John, if you look at it as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth, Matt, is when you look in the banking products, when you look at, as John talked about, market share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual type revenues have been strong.","And again, we don't see anything in the environment that takes away from the outlook of those remaining strong. I think John's talked about a backdrop where we'll see trading remains choppy. But again, we've got an interest rate outlook that, by some people's standards, remains conservative.","So I think we feel good about, on the revenue outlook, where we are, where the global economy is and feel good about, hopefully, at least achieving that 3% number.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just a clarification, the $800 million grossing up of both revenues and expenses, does that show up - I guess, one, is that part of the 3% revenue growth expectation?","John Gerspach","No.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Good. And then that shows up in the fee revenues versus net interest income, right?","John Gerspach","Yes. That will show up in non-interest revenue.","Matt O'Connor","Yeah, perfect. Okay, thank you.","John Gerspach","Its all right.","Operator","Next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, John.","John Gerspach","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Kind of question is if we could turn it around, obviously, the benefits to this country from the lower tax rates have been explained by you and others. You're in a unique position to give us a view of what it might do to some of the other - we have the non-US countries that obviously are not lowering their tax rates.","Do you guys have any sense on what this impact might do to some of the countries you're in that could lose businesses that come to the US or something like that?","Michael Corbat","Gerard, I think it will - it already has, at least in rhetoric, started to put pressure, in particular, on some of those higher-tax economies. The challenge is when you get into those economies from a fiscal perspective, they don't necessarily have the latitude, the leeway or the ability to significantly cut taxes.","And so, again, as we talk about the opportunities out there for us, we start right here in terms of Citi. But in terms of the dialogues we're in, everybody's taking a look at everything, from what repatriation means, to supply chain, to legal vehicle structure, to tax domicile.","And we expect there to be some action, reaction and some movement, which, from a business perspective, should benefit us. But to your point, it's going to put some more pressure on those economies to attempt to become more competitive.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And I may have missed it, but have you guys announced any type of wage increases for your folks? I know some of the other banks have announced the hourly earnings going up and stuff and onetime bonuses. Have you guys announced anything on that front?","Michael Corbat","As of yet, we have not.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And then lastly, John, on the promotional rates that you talked about in credit cards, what's the typical normal term in terms of if somebody takes down one of your cards with a promotional rate, is it 6 months, 12 months?","And then second, when the term expires, what's the roll-off for customers actually to give the card back to you or take the balance down to zero?","John Gerspach","Yes, if you take a look at the - I'm not quite sure that there's a norm because each product has got its own offering. We have - some of our products where we have offered at 21 months interest free for a balance conversion and then 21 months of interest free purchases, that would be the extreme, and then there's others where it will be 7 months of purchases interest free as we have on Costco. So it does vary.","But all of these things are being reassessed, as I mentioned. And we've never commented publicly on what the actual conversion rate is. But I can tell you that as we've seen our earlier vintages actually mature, the conversion rate that we're getting is right in line or even better than our models.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi. You mentioned a new RoTCE target for 2020 of 13%. What is your new ROA target for 2020? At Investor Day, you said it was 90 to 110 basis points.","John Gerspach","Yes, Mike, if you - again, if you do the math on that 20 - on the 200 basis point improvement, it should drive you to an ROA that is somewhere well north of the midpoint of that range that we gave you, a little-- so think about it as being moving towards the upper end of that range of 90 to 110 basis points\u2026.","Mike Mayo","Okay\u2026.","John Gerspach","Specific later on.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And then, John, as far as the efficiency target, you were at 58% in 2017, and now you're looking for 100 basis points better, so 57%. But that still isn't too close to low 50s.","Can you talk about the balance between investing for future growth and letting the savings fall to the bottom line? I mean, what are your biggest areas of investment? How much are you investing? Any change in your CapEx budget or anything else along those lines?","Michael Corbat","So Mike, we've been - when you go back and think about what we talked about at Investor Day and the pathway to a low 50s efficiency, as John described earlier, there's the concept of balance in there, but it's a bit of revenue and it's expense. So on the expense side, it's continued expense discipline, but at the same time, some investments we're making today, as an example, in the digital space where we can convert analog functions to digital functions, improve customer processes and satisfaction, at the same time, get cross-sell.","As an example, when you look at the Mexico investment that we've made, which I think we clearly have to acknowledge as having been helpful in terms of the 6% revenue growth in Mexico today, you look at 3 things there.","One was the branch work we did, the movement to start smart branches. We've got 75 smart branches up and operating. And you go into those branches and watch in terms of what's changed from the reduction in the teller lines and the interaction out in front in terms of some of the machines, 1,600 ATMs with more or increased functionality being put in place.","And then when you look at digital, actually, when we look year-over-year, we've got an increase of 38% of digital engagement in Mexico, above our expectations. And that allows us to continue to drive out costs.","So you look at Mexico, yes, we got 6% revenue growth, but we did that inclusive of investment with 4% expense growth. And so, again, as I think we put some of these things in, and I don't think you'd be surprised in terms of the continued areas of investment.","I think there's nothing really outside of what we've described, but a big emphasis towards digital, towards technology, towards new and smart banking as we go forward and then, obviously, continued investments in place like our TTS businesses and all the things that we've talked about.","So I don't think you should expect anything significant away from that. Maybe we could, based on client and customer uptake, increase the pace or the volume of some of those investments that we see the returns but nothing extraordinary.","Mike Mayo","I'm just trying to figure out if you can get where you're going a little bit faster and if you're satisfied with the progress. I mean, when we look at Mexico, when we look at TTS, when we look at the key metrics, they're moving in the right direction. But then we go back to your old ROA target from 2015 and say, wow, you'll still be getting there in 2020, so that's 5 years later than before.","When we look at your remaining DTAs at the pace that you outlined, they'll be used up in another 10 years. That will be 20 years after the financial crisis. So I'm just wondering if you might revisit your statement from last year where you said the restructuring is over.","Maybe you could have piecemeal restructurings, or maybe you could still sell off some appreciated assets or do something a little bit faster -- again, even though things are moving in the right direction, maybe you can get there sooner?","Michael Corbat","Yes. And as I said, we're always open and we're always looking at things. And certainly, tax reform causes us to take a look. But again, when you look at some of the things you called out, treasury and trade solutions growing 9% in the quarter, 7% in the year, Mexico growing at 6%, those are big upscale businesses that are growing as we would like to grow at a multiple of GDP.","But what we don't want to do is fall into the trap of then saying, let's accelerate that faster, and then start taking outsized growth in the form of balance sheet or other types of risks where we end up stumbling along the way.","So trying to find that right balance, we're going to push ourselves, but we're going to try and make sure we don't make stupid decisions along the way in terms of getting there.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. It's Betsy Graseck.","Michael Corbat","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hey. I just wanted to drill into two things. One was on the branded card. You mentioned that you're expecting to see that growth really be where you're looking for it to be in 2019.","Could you just give us a sense of the road map between now and then? What are some of the key assumptions that you're making that will drive to that higher level of growth in 2019?","John Gerspach","Sure, Betsy. The - there are several, I think, that you should track us on. One is we've talked about one of the key elements, obviously, in driving the revenue growth in branded cards is the continued growth in interest-earning balances.","And there, we now have seen that growth. We've got 4% growth we quoted, excluding, again, the Hilton portfolio. It's just going to give us some noise. But ex the Hilton portfolio, we've gotten now 4% growth in the fourth quarter year-over-year.","And so we feel good about that. And so now we've got sequential growth in those balances for the second quarter in a row, so that puts us on a good pace. We've mentioned last quarter, we touched on it again this quarter, that one of the dampening effects, though, even as we're growing those interest-earning balances, we have a higher than - a higher level of promo balances that we had originally expected to have because of the change in acquisition strategy.","And while we're comfortable with our acquisition strategy, the promo balances are giving us a drag right now. So we're looking to first stabilize those promo balances early in 2018 and then have them decline during the course of '18.","Some of the things that you can see if you go to our website and our offerings, you'll see that we have already begun to alter some of the offerings that we've put out. We've changed the terms. We've shortened the amount of time on some of the promos. Some of the promos we pulled entirely.","So we're managing those promo -- the promo balance line as you would expect us to, given, one, the strong take-up that we had on the other offers; and two, just given the environment that we're in.","So growth in interest-earning, shrinking, declining in the promo balances, and then there's going to be the other aspects of cards that sort of balance along underneath that. This year, we're selling the Hilton portfolio. That's going to give us a big gain in the first quarter, but we then lose the revenues of Hilton in each subsequent quarter, right?","So what we said is think in terms of the gain that we book in the first quarter will basically offset the revenue loss of Hilton for the balance of the year. But again, that's going to give us a year-over-year headwind this year, so that's why it's a little bit -- going into next year, which is why it's going to be a little bit difficult.","So those are some of the things - so - but overall, we say - and again, if you - it should be flattish revenues for 2018, and then revenue should begin to grow in 2019, basically delaying our growth profile in cards by about a year.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. That was a great explanation. The question - the follow-up is just on retail partner cards. We haven't spoken so much on this call about that. Could you give a sense of the strategy there? And one of your partners is closing stores. Are you seeing an impact on that or not? Give us some sense of how you're managing that business.","John Gerspach","We really haven't seen - I mean, the retail services business is moving along very nicely. I mentioned the fact that the revenue growth is actually higher than what we had originally expected. We've got excellent engagement with our clients there, and I've said that we're working well with each one of our retailers.","That means - again, that's one of the core competencies, I think, that retail services provides is the stability of partnership and advisory approach to each of the retailers. And we offer advanced analytics, digital marketing capabilities.","I think all of that is what's coming through in the strong revenue performance in retail services, even as some retailers are closing stores. Don't forget, in retail services, some of our cards are general purpose cards, and we're seeing real good out-of-store purchases off of those cards as well.","So it's not just the in-store purchase activity that is driving that business. Also, for many of the cards where we've got general purpose cards out there, and so it's much more of a co-brand relationship, we're seeing good out-of-store purchase activity as well.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And then just one separate topic on tax. There's a lot of discussion about the BEAT. And I noticed that - I think you mentioned it didn't really have a much impact on you. Could you just give us some color as to why that's the case or how you're structured in a way that enables you to avoid that?","John Gerspach","Yes, I'm trying to think about why would our structure force us to be in there. Based upon our structure, we're really not impacted by the base erosion anti-abuse tax. I - if you ask me, I guess it's probably - our foreign branch structure probably gives us a little bit of help with regard to BEAT maybe compared to others.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. As opposed to subsidiary.","John Gerspach","Correct. But the branches - again, branches are taxed as part of the - or considered part of the U.S. tax entity.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Okay. Thank you.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning, good afternoon.","Michael Corbat","Hi.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Mike, maybe this one is for you. As we think about a new regulatory regime as we enter the future stress test balance with the write-down in tangible book value and, of course, what that implies for valuation, could you give us an update in terms of your preferences of capital return between buybacks and dividends?","Michael Corbat","Sure. So I would say the tax reform has not changed the approach that we've talked about historically. One is that continuing to walk the dividend up so that from a current yield perspective, the dividend remains competitive amongst our peers and dedicating the vast majority of our capital return capacity or capabilities towards buyback.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And, John, just a follow up question. You mentioned earlier that for every quarter that we have an additional 25 basis points on the short, and that's about $80 million a quarter. In your modeling, what does that assume for deposit costs?","John Gerspach","That reflects our updated view of deposit beta. If you go back a year or so - I think I was asked that same question. The guidance then would have been - for 25 basis points, we would have expected roughly 100.","So now, just given the fact that - the assumption is that deposit beta will continue to increase, that's why the new guidance would be closer to $80 million.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hey, good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So a quick question. You gave - you reiterated the guidance on the NCL rate both for branded cards and retail services. But I mean, shouldn't your borrowers or customers also benefit from tax reform?","So I mean, is there some chance that you come in better than that guidance post tax reform?","John Gerspach","Yes, there clearly is, Brian. I mean, right now, our assessment is that, that benefit certainly would give us even greater confidence in those forward projections that we put out there.","But we really haven't had a chance to run every aspect of tax reform in every MSA around the country through our various models to see what that might give us as far as any improvement in our NCL projections going forward.","But I agree with you that when you take a look at the positive impact of tax reform, and I think Mike mentioned this in his opening comments, the expectation is that with higher take-home pay, you would expect consumers to either increase spending or perhaps increase the payment rate on existing debt.","Both of those things would be beneficial to the economy. Both of those things would be beneficial to consumers, and they both should be beneficial to us.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And just a follow-up also on the NCL. You mentioned last quarter that you were seeing stabilization in the collections rates. Are you seeing any improvement quarter-over-quarter on those collection rates? Thanks.","John Gerspach","Yes, and we definitely have seen improvement in line with our expectations. And so, again, that's one of the reasons why we were reaffirming the view towards a 5% NCL rate in retail services -- approximate 5% NCL rate in retail services in 2018. And again, we're reaffirming the guidance of around a 300 basis point NCL rate in U.S.-branded cards for 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Saul.","Saul Martinez","A couple of questions. It seems like you are making progress in Mexico. You have good business momentum there. But are you concerned at all about the macro backdrop? There has been a pretty pronounced slowdown in loan growth in the fourth quarter in Mexico, and that includes cards.","There's tick-up in delinquencies. You have the election, obviously, where the frontrunner is sort of a left-leaning guy with some populist tendencies, obviously, NAFTA uncertainty. But do you worry at all that sort of the macro backdrop, the election, the credit cycle could trip you up in your progress there?","Michael Corbat","Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to it, Saul, and we are watching it closely. And if you look at NAFTA, clearly, we believe the benefits to the U.S. and Canada and Mexico are important. That alliance is important.","As we look at the numbers, you've seen the Mexican economy underperforming. I think, right now, growth forecasts look like Mexico is probably going to come in somewhere around 2.1%. That's clearly under-growing where it should be.","So part of the NAFTA overhang is already built in. But if we saw NAFTA completely fall apart, it would probably have some impact and probably have more of an impact on our corporate franchise than the consumer franchise.","The election, obviously, we're watching and we'll see how that unfolds. But again, as we look at our position in Mexico, we think we've got the continued ability to outgrow our consumer franchise at a pace as we've described is a multiple of GDP that's there.","I think the other thing that you've seen is in spite of the fact that the dollar has weakened some you've actually seen the peso weaken further. Really, if you go back to midsummer at its point, it was probably about at its strongest. We've probably seen about a 15% depreciation versus the dollar since then, and that's made, obviously, the peso more competitive.","So you've got to measure the ins and outs. But net-net if we don't get NAFTA, net-net if we end up with the election with a more leftist candidate, it will likely hurt the economy from here.","Saul Martinez","Okay. That's helpful. Can you comment on M&A? You've just done M&A as a strategy to deploy capital. There are opportunities there. How do you think about it in terms of your overall capital strategy?","John Gerspach","So when we think of M&A, we don't think of being out there and buying another bank or a big bank. A couple of things, one is from a regulatory perspective, not just for us, but certainly for the bigger banks in the industry, that would probably be challenged from a regulatory approval perspective.","And candidly, at this point in time, I don't think we're all that keen about taking on big branch infrastructure that - we've got infrastructure in our consumer business. We've got infrastructure in our consumer business that already has us at scale. And I think we'd rather take that same investment as we're doing and channel it towards digital and other things where we can get growth organically.","And I think you're seeing that in the strategy today. And where opportunities present themselves around portfolios with different types of bolt-ons that are in strategy, we're wide open. We've got the capital. We've got the balance sheet. We've got the risk appetite for those things that fit us. And so we continue to look at those. But again, when we think about and talk about and create expectations for you, it's predominantly organically led.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So you don't feel like you need any branch infrastructure outside of your core 6 markets in the U.S.?","John Gerspach","No. Again, we - we're going the other way. Others are going the other way. And we hope and believe and are making the investment in digital and think we can continue to grow our franchise using digital rather than physical branch footprint.","Saul Martinez","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. If I could follow up on the NII dollars. John, thanks for giving that core accrual and legacy. I wanted to ask about the trading part, and I know it's quite volatile. But you had that $1.66 billion delta this year and you ended at $510 million. Can you help us try to range what you could expect that to do - that part to do this year?","John Gerspach","In 2018?","Ken Usdin","Yes.","John Gerspach","I think, Ken, maybe the best way to think about it is if you look at the fourth quarter, we were down in trading related NIR [ph] $430 million or so, and then as you mentioned, that's $1.7 million for the year. And there's an element of that, that is going to be just difficult to predict because it's related to changes in trading strategies and balance sheet structure, et cetera.","But I think you can get a sense of the impact of higher funding costs, which is what we called out in my prepared commentary. You can get a sense of that. If you take a look at Slide 19 of the financial supplement, and if you look there, take a look at the trading-related assets and liabilities, along with the categories Fed funds sold and repurchased -- and purchased.","And if you look at those lines, you're going to see that with the - when you take a look at the assets and liabilities that are really clearly associated with our trading business, just a little over - the trading liabilities fund, just a little bit over half of the level of assets that we employ in our trading business.","Now that means that the balance -- you got to think about it as primarily being funded by debt, some form of debt with 3 months' LIBOR rate as a good proxy to the cost of that funding. So obviously, as we've seen 3-month LIBOR is steadily increasing, well, we've seen trading-related NIR decline.","I mean, I'm being overly simplistic. I have said there are certainly other factors that impact trading related NIR, but in periods of steadily rising rates, that's the factor that's going to have the largest impact.","Ken Usdin","Okay. That's a good way to think about it. I'll come back if I have questions about that. And then the other question is, in your core, are you contemplating both the Hilton sale, as well as the delta to your just FTE component, which I know is not a big number, but is that all contemplated in the other 2 components?","John Gerspach","Yes. Everything is - everything that you just mentioned is - all those factors are in the guidance that we gave you.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Last thing then, just on the loan yields overall, I know there's a lot of moving parts also quarter-to-quarter and all that. But just on the loan yields, the decline this quarter of 13 basis points, I know probably some of that is the teaser balances.","But can you - how much is mix and how much is volume, can you help us understand what the moving parts are of loan yields? Thanks.","John Gerspach","I don't have that broken out, but obviously mix is definitely playing a role in NIM. So if you take a look at our core NIM, which declined 2 basis points for the quarter and maybe it was roughly 5 basis points for the full year, in the quarter, the decline really was just due to the impact of currency rates.","But underneath that, what we've seen is a change in mix. So our corporate loans, which have good but lower NIM than - our corporate loans are growing faster than our consumer loans. And therefore, we've got a change in mix that is certainly contributing to that flattish NIM on a sequential basis and also contributing to the somewhat flattish NIM on a year-over-year basis as well.","So we're seeing the loan growth. It's generating good net interest revenue, that's why you're seeing the growth. And you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter. But just given the fact that a lot of that is coming off of the corporate loans, it's changing - it's depressing the overall level of NIM at this point in time.","Ken Usdin","Yeah, okay. Understood. Thanks a lot.","John Gerspach","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","John Gerspach","Morning, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Yes. Can you hear me now?","John Gerspach","Yes. How are you doing Marty?","Marty Mosby","Thanks. When you look at the tax rate for this particular quarter and it being down lower, is that a reflection of when you kind of look at your expectations or reserves against taxes, you have that, and as the tax rate is going down in the future, you would adjust the reserves that you need on potential benefit?","And the reason I'm getting at that is there's been about half the banks that had this particular impact in this particular quarter before we got into the actual rate going down.","So I was thinking that would force out why you're thinking you're down at 24%, too, down the road?","John Gerspach","No, Marty. I mean, it's a good thought, but really, what's driving our tax rate lower this quarter, that 25.1%, it's really just the - an impact of one episodic item, that one episodic discrete item that was in the fourth quarter.","That's what we tried to call out earlier in the call when we pointed to the fact that a combination of a tax good guide is one discrete item that benefited the corporate tax rate and one tax \"bad guide\" that ended up in these gaps added about $0.08 per share to the earnings. So it's just a combination of two episodic discrete tax items.","Marty Mosby","Okay. It had nothing to do with the future tax rate going down?","John Gerspach","No, sir.","Marty Mosby","The other thing I was going to ask you was we've talked a lot about the improvement in returns and earnings as you go forward but not a lot about reduction in the tangible book value as you change the DTA this quarter. It was about a - it looks like about $10 per share that it came down.","And if you look at the increase in your returns, incrementally, it could add $1 to $1.50 per year to make that up. So it's going to take a while to get back up from where we're at. I just was curious how you all thought about that in the sense of the dilution that you took upfront with the write-off.","John Gerspach","Yes. We've always had the deferred tax assets in our tangible book value and our total book value. And I think many have questions as far as the future value of those things. We always thought of those as being something that you would look at more on an annuity basis because we knew that you'd be getting the value of those assets over time.","And while we did take that write-off, there still is a remaining annuity value to the DTA that is on the books. So we still think that there's good value there. The reduction in the tangible book value or the book value, which is about $8 a share.","I think when you look at the fact that we're generating a 200 basis point improvement at a minimum of - to RoTCE out into the future, I still think it's a pretty good trade-off.","So you've got more certainty in the book value because the uncertain element of the DTA - the value of the DTA has been removed and you've traded that uncertainty for a real improvement in your RoTCE. So again, I think that the trade-off is overall accretive to the value of the stock.","Marty Mosby","Got it. Thanks.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.","Andrew Lim","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a following question on the trading NII that you talked about earlier. I mean, as the 3 months LIBOR keeps on going up, I guess, theoretically, this might head down towards 0 and maybe even negative. Is that something theoretically that's possible?","And if that is on the table as a possibility, is it something that you could consider to wind up your trading strategies?","John Gerspach","As I've said, there's a lot of moving pieces. There are a lot of moving pieces in trading related NIR. And the best way to actually look at the business is not through this one line item. This is just a factor of balance sheet construction and interest rate movement. That is not the way that we or you should evaluate the health of our trading businesses.","So we really encourage you to look at the overall revenue performance in these trading businesses. And when you take a look at our FICC trading business, it's either number one or number two. We definitely have been gaining market share. So no, we're not going to shut down our FICC business because of trading related net interest revenue.","Andrew Lim","Right. So everything should be taken as a whole. I understand. Okay. And then just on the net charge-off guidance that you've given there, what kind of interest rates do you look at in terms of giving that guidance? And how should we look at that, too, from a macro perspective? Do you look at like the short end, 1 to 2 years or is it increasingly like the 5 years as corporates and so forth have termed out their borrowing?","John Gerspach","When we try to put models into play, we take a look at the overall economic environment, including where we think the -- where we see interest rates going, which is a combination of short end and long end, which is going to have different behavioral impacts on either consumers or corporate clients. So the answer is all of that goes in.","Andrew Lim","All right. Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Our final question is from Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and for the presentation. My first question is regarding the outlook that you have for 2018 and going forward on your IB trading business. Overall, I just want to know if you think that the tax reform will be enough to kick the period in Q1 and Q2 effectively and offset the prolonged low volatility.","And the second question, which is effectively a follow-up of this question, is whether you see any significant margin pressure at the moment in your IB trading product. And if you do, I'm just trying to find the - what you think is the primary reason.","We've already mentioned the higher funding costs, but I'm wondering whether you think that you're now facing high competition from your bank peers or a new competition from fintech? Thank you very much.","Michael Corbat","So maybe I'll start with the first one. But Al, I understand when you say IB, you actually mean sales and trading as part of...","Al Alevizakos","Yes, just the trading, yes.","Michael Corbat","Okay. So one, I think I described and John described a couple of things, both on a relative and an absolute basis. So on a relative basis, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons coming out of 2016 with the elections, obviously, activity was down a bit.","And I think what we've talked about and described on this call historically is we don't necessarily measure trading by the quarter. We don't necessarily measure by the month. It is oftentimes week to week, it's day to day, and it's very, very much event-driven. And so we've talked about an outlook in terms of rates going forward. So if we start to see more rate increases, you could see some more activity around that.","John also talked about the mix of our business being a bit different. But for us, it's not just the investors. The corporate client plays an extremely important part. And that I could argue in terms of foreign exchange and some other things that might be related to repatriations, money movements, domicile, et cetera, that we could see some activity coming out of that business as people react to tax reform that's there.","But it's - our intention in the business to - the growth is going to look like and feel like more coming from share gains than the consolidation of a leadership position. And I think you saw that in a down revenue, down wallet year in terms of trading, that we actually fared pretty well there. And that's my expectation is that there would be more of that as we go through '18. And the second part of your question, Al, was on margins in the business?","Al Alevizakos","Yes, just wanted to understand whether you think about pricing is actually going a bit lower. So it's not only about volumes anymore but actually pricing becomes part of the issue going forward.","John Gerspach","Yes. Al, it's John now. Pricing has certainly been an issue in that business for the last several years. We've seen continued pressure on pricing. And I think you have to assume that, that continues. That's one of the reasons why we talked about this really being a scale business. If you're not prepared to make the investments in technology, which we've done, and if you don't have that good client base in order to work with, you're going to be in trouble.","One of the things that we always point to, especially in our rates and currencies business, is that a large percentage of our client revenues come from corporate clients. And corporate clients are different from investor clients because corporate clients are in the market every day because they really have to hedge their overall balance sheet. They got to think in terms of working capital management. It's different than investor clients.","And this year, in rates and currencies, corporate clients formed 45% of our client revenues, and even in a year where overall client revenues declined in the industry, we actually had a 5% growth in our corporate client revenue. So that was enough to actually generate an overall increase for us in client revenues in our rates and currencies business.","So yes, there's a lot of changing dynamics in the marketplace, but we really think it boils down to being able to focus on your customers, which is why we talk about client-led revenue, to make sure that you are investing in the necessary technology, and those are the things that we're doing.","Al Alevizakos","Great. Thank you very much for the answers.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Michael Corbat","Thanks for your question.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Jamie. Thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any questions, please reach out to Investor Relations.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brian. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take your question.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $2.7 billion for the fourth quarter, excluding CVA and DVA and the impact of the credicard divestiture, net income was $2.6 billion, or $0.82 a share.","In our institutional business, our fourth quarter markets performance reflected an ongoing challenging environment sequentially while our rates and currencies revenues were relatively stable, our credit and securitized products revenues were lower due to reduced client activity. And while on equities, client flows were relatively stable, we underperformed in trading.","In contrast, investment banking showed positive momentum during the quarter driven by strong M&A and equity underwriting and we increased our overall wallet share for the year. Transactions services products demonstrated resilience in the low interest rate environment and regain positive operating leverage for the second half of the year. Importantly we continue to grow both our client volumes and market share, while demonstrating strong fee revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.","Our consumer bank performed well internationally with Latin America showing continued revenue growth. The ongoing efforts to reposition our franchise in Korea continue to impact our Asian results, but the region had good performance otherwise. Our U.S business saw revenue boost from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio. We saw positive drivers in our Citi branded cards business and mortgage revenues broadly stabilized during the quarter.","For the full year 2013 with every bit as challenging as we thought it would be when we entered the year. Low interest rates, changing expectations regarding the tapering of quantitative easing, the increase in cost of legal settlements, all had significant impacts on our bottom line.","However, while we didn\u2019t finish 2013 as strongly as I would have liked, very pleased with the progress we made over the course of the year, especially in regard to several critical areas I highlighted in my first earnings call with you last January.","As a Company we improved our efficiency, completing the repositioning effort we announced last December. We\u2019ve reduced our operating expenses by 2% and our headcount by 3% in 2013, while exiting segments that didn\u2019t fit our strategy. Key metrics such as ROTCE and ROA also improved as we made progress towards the targets we announced in March. We also began to tap into our deferred tax asset with $600 million of DTA utilized in the fourth quarter, which brought the total amount utilized to $2.4 billion for the year.","Turning to Citi Holdings with a $39 billion reduction in assets, we shrunk its size by 25% in 2013. We narrowed its annual loss by half when compared to 2012 making good progress for getting to breakeven. We also managed to put several legacy issues behind this through settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.","By focusing intently on our clients, we grew loans in Citicorp by 7% over 2012 and improved our market share across our institutional businesses. And our net income of $13.8 billion was 15% above 2012 and the highest since before the financial crisis.","Higher net income help to accelerate the growth of capital during the year and we exceeded our goal of ending 2013 with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10% by 50 basis points. We also received no objection to the capital plan we submitted to our regulators in early 2013, in addition our supplementary leverage ratio increased to an estimated 5.4% exceeding the regulatory requirement.","But being pleased with our progress doesn\u2019t make us satisfied and I know our shareholders aren\u2019t either. We still have work to do to generate the results that our shareholders expect and reserve -- deserve.","Looking to 2014, we expect to be tested again as we believe the environment while improving will remain challenging. We believe short-term interest rates will remain low for the foreseeable future and although we are working hard to put the remaining legacy issues behind us, legal headwinds will remain with us and the industry.","And while we do see an improving economic environment, growth won\u2019t be robust really by any means. We believe the deceleration of growth in Asia has bottomed out and the euro zone is continuing to recover that albeit slowly.","Our projections for key markets such as Mexico, India and Korea call for improvements over 2013 levels. In the U.S we believe our mortgage revenues have stabilized and we are working to reduce the costs associated with legacy assets in Citi Holdings as the recently announced sale of certain mortgage servicing rights shows.","We\u2019ve entered 2014 as a strong and stable institution as we work to leverage our unparallel global network to the benefit of our clients. We are completely focused on executing our strategy and remain committed to the targets we announced last year as well as our objective of returning capital to our shareholders.","With that, I will now turn it over to John and he can go through the deck and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were negative $164 million pre-tax and $100 million after tax in the fourth quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.03 per share.","We also recorded an after tax benefit of $189 million related to the Credicard divestiture this quarter for a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share. For comparison purposes, in the fourth quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $485 million pre-tax or $301 million after tax for a negative impact of $0.10 per share.","In addition, last year we recorded a large repositioning charge of over $1 billion pre-tax or $653 million after tax which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.21 per share. Given the size of the repositioning charge in the fourth quarter of 2012, I will be discussing our results today excluding this item. However, we have continued to incur small repositioning charges as part of our ongoing expense initiatives, and these charges are included in our expense numbers for 2013.","Adjusting for CVA, DVA and the impact of the credicard divestiture and the fourth quarter 2012 repositioning charges, we earned $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 or $0.82 per share as compared to $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012.","On Slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned 2.6 billion in the fourth quarter, up over 20% from last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit cards were partially offset by a decline in revenues and a higher effective tax rate.","The effective tax rate was 32% for the fourth quarter of 2013, somewhat above the prior quarter and full year tax rate, primarily due to the amount of legal accruals estimated to be nondeductible.","On a full year basis, revenues grew 1% while operating expenses were 2% lower and credit cards also declined by over 2.8 billion, driving earnings growth of 15%. Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 668 billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits grew to $968 billion.","On Slide 5 we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In consumer banking, revenues grew by over $200 million, sequentially, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition and continued growth in Latin America, and year-over-year the decline mostly reflected lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity.","Securities and banking revenues declined by over $450 million, sequentially, reflecting lower markets revenues, partially offset by growth in investment banking. And year-over-year, fixed income revenues were down, however both equities and investment banking showed improvement.","In transaction services, revenues have been fairly stable as growth in volumes and fees continued to be offset by lower spreads. Citi Holdings revenues improved year-over-year mostly reflecting the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $260 million of the reported revenue decline year-over-year.","On Slide 6 we show more expense details. Core operating expenses of 10.9 billion in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 340 million year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by efficiency savings and a decline in Citi Holdings assets, partially offset by volume-related expenses.","Sequentially, costs were down by roughly $50 million reflecting additional repositioning savings, partially offset by seasonal marketing expenses, deal-related costs in securities and banking and higher than anticipated expenses in retail services in the quarter related to the integration of the Best Buy portfolio.","Legal and related costs were just over $800 million in the fourth quarter, and as we had disclosed previously repositioning costs were somewhat higher than recent quarters at $234 million. In addition, we incurred an incremental $33 million of compensatory fees to Fannie Mae related to the sale of servicing rights out of Citi Holdings we announced yesterday.","On a full year basis, core operating expenses of 44.3 billion in 2013 declined by nearly $900 million, driven by firm wide efficiency savings and asset reductions in Citi Holdings, partially offset by volume-related growth and investments in Citicorp, as well as higher regulatory-related expenses. However, legal and related expenses continued to be elevated at roughly $3 billion.","On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, pre-tax earnings grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as a decline in revenues was more than offset by lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit. And on a full year basis, pre-tax earnings improved by 5% with revenues roughly flat and expenses down by 4%, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year.","Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and the net loss was roughly 400 million. For the full year, Citi Holdings losses declined by nearly half from $3.7 billion last year to $1.9 billion in 2013, driven by a significant improvement in credit and declining assets partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Citi Holdings assets declined by 25% during the year to 117 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets.","Turning to Citicorp on Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking again in constant dollars. On this basis, revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while expenses increased by 3%, driven entirely by repositioning charges of roughly $80 million. International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly Korea.","However, most key drivers remain positive with both average loans and card purchase sales up 6% from last year. On a full year basis, revenues increased by 3% driven by Latin America, while expenses grew 1% resulting in positive operating leverage. Credit cards increased in 2013, however, the NCL rate remains stable and loan loss reserve builds were mostly driven by portfolio growth, as well as specific builds for Mexico homebuilders during the year, as we have previously discussed.","On Slide 9, we show revenue details for Asia consumer. Lower retail banking revenues in the fourth quarter reflected the continued impact of regulatory changes, spread compression and the repositioning of our franchise in Korea. Investment sales revenues remain muted in fourth quarter, in line with investor sentiment. And cards revenues improved slightly both year-over-year and sequentially with continued growth in purchase sales across the region.","Korea remains a headwind, however, we continue to believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize in early 2014. Importantly, credit trends have remained stable in Korea and Korea's drag on year-over-year loan growth for total Asia has diminished in recent quarters. Over time, Korea should better reflect our consumer franchise elsewhere around the world with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities, a focus on high quality consumer segments and improved returns.","Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 8% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of 1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year, mostly reflecting the lower mortgage refinancing activity. Sequentially, mortgage revenues have begun to stabilize but we'll continue to present a drag on year-over-year comparisons though at least the first half of 2014.","Branded cards revenues of 2.1 billion were flat versus last year and up 2% from last quarter, driven by continued improvement in net interest spreads and growth in purchase sales, offsetting the impact of lower average loans. Retail services grew 9% versus the prior quarter and prior year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Average loans grew 18% year-over-year, however, spreads declined as promotional balances increased.","Total operating expenses of 2.4 billion were down 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower legal and related costs, ongoing efficiency savings and the resizing of the mortgage business, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy acquisition. Credit cost declined modestly year-over-year but grew 19% sequentially driven by lower reserve releases in branded cards and the impact of Best Buy.","Overall our North America business executed well in 2013 in the phase of many significant changes, from the resizing of our mortgage business to the continued revitalization of the branded cards franchise and the Best Buy portfolio acquisition, and we continued to see momentum in the fourth quarter.","Average deposits were up 5%, commercial market loans grew by 10% and purchase sale growth improved in branded cards reflecting the impact of investments in that business as well as an acceleration of growth in the American Airlines portfolio since the merger with US Airways was approved.","We are pleased that we were recently awarded exclusive rights to issue new credit card accounts in support of American Airlines following the planned merger of the American and US Airways frequent flyer programs by mid 2015.","Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable in North America in the fourth quarter. With the decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement as well as the impact of the Best Buy portfolio which was acquired late in the third quarter. Looking forward we currently anticipate the NCL rate in North America to be in the range of 3% for full-year 2014 as new loans continued to season in the Best Buy portfolio.","In Asia, credit trends remain stable in the fourth quarter, and in Latin America we saw an uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates. The higher NCL rate in the fourth quarter primarily reflected the impact of portfolio seasoning in Mexico. Looking to full-year 2014, we currently expect this portfolio seasoning to continue with the NCL rate in Latin America being broadly in the range of the levels we saw in the second half of 2013. However the NCL rate maybe somewhat higher in the first quarter as we typically see a seasonal decline in card loan balances.","In addition, as we have said previously we took loan loss reserves in 2013 related to our exposure to Mexican home builders as well as the hurricanes in Mexico in the third quarter. Any losses from the home builders or the impact from the hurricanes may increase our NCL rate in the current quarters. However we would expect these losses to be charged against the reserve and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit. The increase in the delinquency rate in the fourth quarter was mostly driven by our exposure to home builders in Mexico.","Slide 12 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $4.6 billion declined 5% from last year and 9% sequentially. Investment banking revenues of $1 billion were up 3% from the prior year and 23% from last quarter, driven by M&A and equity underwriting partially offset by lower debt underwriting revenues. Full-year investment banking revenues of $4 billion grew by 8% as we continued to gain overall wallet share.","Equity market revenues of $539 million in the fourth quarter were up 16% from last year, reflecting improved client activity in both cash and derivatives. Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 24% as trading performance was weaker and client activity slowed somewhat in December. However we still made significant progress in a full year basis with equity market revenues up 22% reflecting market share gains, improvements in derivatives execution and a more favorable environment. Fixed income market revenues of $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter declined 15% from last year and 16% sequentially.","Overall trading conditions remained muted for fixed income as the government shutdown in the early weeks of the quarter as well as continued speculation around the timing of fed tapering resulted in an environment similar to the third quarter where it was more difficult to generate incremental trading revenues on client flows. In addition, both the year-over-year and sequential decline reflected the absence of any significant revenues from our Citi Capital Advisors business which we continued to wind down. This business was not a material revenue contributor historically but did have a strong fourth quarter in 2012.","And finally while our rates in currencies business showed resilience in the fourth quarter with revenues down only slightly from the third quarter we did see a decline in spread products, particularly in securitized products. For the full-year fixed income market revenues of $13 billion declined by 7%. Our full-year results reflected market share gains across most products including strong performance in credit and securitized products.","However, we saw fewer market opportunities in rates and currencies. Private bank revenues of $599 million were up slightly from last year and down 2% sequentially driven by lower capital markets activity. Lending revenues excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans were $393 million in the fourth quarter up from prior periods as higher volumes and lower losses from loan sale activity were partially offset by lower spreads.","Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down versus the prior-year driven by lower compensation expenses partially offset by higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis expenses were flat as lower compensation expenses were offset by higher deal related and legal-end related costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange. On a full-year basis the franchise continued to show momentum with revenues up 4% driven by equities, investment banking and our private bank while expenses declined by 3% resulting in 16% growth in pre-tax earnings.","Moving to transaction services on Slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 1% from last year in constant dollars as strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues. Treasury and trade solutions was flat year-over-year as volume in fee growth was offset by the continued impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues were up 5% as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads. Client activity grew across the franchise.","Trade loan originations were up 12% year-over-year, average deposits grew 9%, assets under custody were up 10% and SFS settlement volumes grew by 15%. Despite these volume gains expenses of $1.4 billion declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars driven by efficiency savings as well as lower and legal related costs. Given the modest revenue growth in expense decline in the fourth quarter transaction services achieved positive operating leverage for the second half of 2013.","On Slide 14 we show expense and efficiency trends for the total institutional franchise. On a trailing 12 month basis, we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for the past two years driving the total efficiency ratio from 67% in 2011 to 58% in 2013. Compensation has been a significant contributor with the comp ratio for the total institutional franchise improving to 29% in 2013.","In securities and banking we have reduced the annual cost base by $1 billion since 2011, and while we have additional work to do on a full-year basis for 2013 our efficiency ratio in securities and banking was 59% within our 2015 target range of 55% to 60%. And in transaction services the efficiency ratio was 54% somewhat above our 48% to 52% target.","However as you can see here we have been able to keep expenses flat at $5.7 billion even as we have gained market share and built significant volumes. This should position us well for margin expansion in the future as we look to continue increasing the C component of our revenues as spreads stabilize and we begin to see the cost savings from repositioning actions taken in 2013.","Slide 15 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were up versus the prior year mainly driven by hedging activities partially offset by lower AFS sales while expenses declined, mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Assets of 314 billion included approximately 116 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 141 billion of liquid available for sale securities.","Slide 16 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of 117 billion in Citi Holdings or 6% of total Citigroup assets. The $5 billion reduction in the fourth quarter reflected $4 billion of net pay downs and $1 billion of asset sales. These sales included roughly 400 million of North America mortgages most of which were non-performing.","On Slide 17 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of 1.3 billion were up year-over-year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds this quarter. Citi Holdings expenses decreased 4% year-over-year to 1.5 billion, driven by the decline in assets partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Excluding legal costs, operating expenses declined 16% to roughly 825 million while with North America mortgages comprising over a third of these operating expenses.","As I mentioned earlier, yesterday we announced the sale of mortgage servicing rights for loans with a balance of roughly $10 billion. While this is only about 10% of our third party servicing portfolio in Citi Holdings, the sale includes the majority of the delinquent loans we serviced for Fannie Mae, and it represents nearly 20% of the total loans currently serviced by Citi mortgage that are 60 days or more past due. This sale should benefit our mortgage expenses in Citi Holdings beginning in the second quarter.","Net credit losses continued to improved year-over-year and we released 540 million of loans loss reserves, substantially all of which was related to North America mortgages. Mortgage net credit losses in the fourth quarter included 184 million of incremental charge-offs related to three items.","First, a change in charge-off policy for mortgages originated in Citi financial to more closely aligned to policies used in the Citi mortgage business. Second, the acceleration of accounting losses associated with modified home equity loans determined to be collateral dependent. And third, a change in the estimate of net credit losses related to collateral dependent loans to borrowers that have gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These incremental charge-offs were almost fully offset by related loan loss reserve releases during the quarter.","Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on Slide 18, excluding legal and related expenses the operating margin in Citi Holdings was positive again this quarter, while credit costs continued to improve. The pre-tax loss in Citi Holdings was roughly 500 million, driven by 647 million of legal and related expenses. Legal and related costs remained elevated during 2013, driven largely by legacy private label securitization and other mortgage related issues. It remains difficult for us to determine the ultimate timing and cost of resolving these issues. However, as we've said previously, we are hopeful we will have better clarity by sometime this year.","On Slide 19, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings. We ended the quarter with $73 billion of North America mortgages, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by 50% and the loss rate improved by roughly 120 basis points. Here, we show the breakdown of residential first mortgages originated in Citi mortgage versus the legacy Citi financial business. As you can see, while loan balances and net credit losses are declining in both portfolios, the loans originated in Citi financial are becoming a larger proportion of the total.","Given the borrower profile in Citi financial, these loans tend to have higher loss rates at around 5% versus the loss rate of around 1% for Citi mortgage first mortgages. We ended the quarter with 4.9 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages and Citi Holdings or 39 months of NCL coverage. Looking at 2014, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we continue to expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset a substantial portion of our mortgage net credit losses.","On Slide 20 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue grew to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in average interest earning assets and a sequential improvement in margin. Our net interest margin grew by 7 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower funding costs as well as stable loan and investment yields. We currently expect our net interest margin in 2014 should be at or around the 285 basis points we achieved in 2013 with fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.","On Slide 21 we show our key capital metrics. Quarter-over-quarter, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio remained roughly flat at 10.5%, as our Tier 1 common capital continued to grow driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization, but our risk-weighted assets also increased by approximately $40 billion. Our DTA utilization this quarter was roughly $600 million bringing our total utilization for the year to roughly 2.4 billion, approximately 2 billion of which was comprised of foreign tax credit carryforwards.","The increase in risk-weighted assets quarter-over-quarter is entirely driven by an increase in our estimated risk-weighted assets associated with operational risks. We continued to further refine and enhance our models under Basel III and given the evolving regulatory and litigation environment, we felt it prudent to increase our operational risks RWA during the quarter. Any changes to operational risks RWA, however, do not have an impact with calculating our estimated Basel III supplementary leverage ratio which increased to 5.4% in the fourth quarter.","As we continue to move towards full Basel III implementation, we expect there could be additional refinements or required enhancements to our Basel III models as well as further regulatory implementation guidance. In addition, our Basel III modeled remained subject to regulatory review and approval. Any such changes or requirements could result in additional increases in our risk-weighted assets or changes to other elements involved in the calculation of our Basel III ratios.","In summary, we clearly faced a difficult environment in the fourth quarter with continued challenging trading conditions and low interest rates. However, against this backdrop we did make progress on several fronts. Investment banking revenues were strong driven by M&A and equity underwriting. Our consumer business returned to growth quarter-over-quarter driven by Latin America and the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","In Citi Holdings, we continued to drive towards breakeven and we ended the year with a strong capital position at an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10.5% and a supplementary leverage ratio of 5.4%. On a full year basis we improved on each of our key financial targets with better operating efficiency in Citicorp and higher Citigroup returns on both assets and tangible common equity.","Looking forward to 2014, in consumer we expect the low interest rate environment to continue. However, some of the headwinds that affected us in 2013 should abate as we go through the year. In the U.S., we believe that mortgage revenues have broadly stabilized, while the impact of capacity reductions will result in lower expenses. Branded cards is beginning to show visible improvement and we will benefit from a full year of Best Buy revenues. And for international, we believe revenues in Korea should begin to stabilize early this year alleviating the drag on Asia while Latin America should continue to grow.","Our securities and banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients. And in transaction services we expect continued volume in fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment.","Turning to expenses, core operating expenses excluding legal and related as well as repositioning costs were roughly $44.3 billion for full year 2013. Looking forward our goal is to continue improving Citicorp efficiency while winding down the assets and expenses in Citi Holdings. Our core operating expenses will vary with the revenue environment, but as an example looking at a low single-digit revenue growth scenario in Citicorp.","We would expect our core operating expenses in 2014 to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013 as continued productivity efforts offset by volume related growth investments going to continue to increase in regulatory related expenses. And of course there would be variability quarter-to-quarter, particularly driven by our markets businesses. Repositioning expenses are expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2014 roughly in line with the levels we incurred in the fourth quarter.","Finally, legal expenses which totaled approximately $3 billion for full year 2013 are expected to remain elevated into 2014. In this environment we remain focused on execution. Gaining share with our clients, improving our efficiency, maintaining our credit discipline and winding down Citi Holdings in an economically rationale manner.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. I was wondering about if you could discuss the roadmap to the 2015 financial targets? On the efficiency side of the targets, can you remind us of the levers that you can pull to get the Citicorp to the mid 50 efficiency ratio because when we include the repositioning expenses it just doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re experiencing major progress on the core expenses? So you mentioned ICG is largely there John, may be you could talk about where the -- what can you do to get these efficiency targets in \u201915?","John Gerspach","Well, we did make progress on those efficiency targets in \u201913. As I said, when you take a look at the overall efficiency target that we set was going to be in the mid 50%, on the mid 50s. We came down to 58% for Citicorp during 2013 and as I said -- I didn\u2019t say that ICG is largely there John, I meant to say if I didn\u2019t say that securities and banking is at least within the range right now, but we do still have more work to do. In transaction services, we\u2019ve been investing in that business and we haven\u2019t had as much repositioning effort necessarily in transaction services as we did in securities and banking during 2013. So I still think that there are things that we can do there, there are levers that we can pull as you put it going in to 2014.","And finally on consumer, consumer is the one where we didn\u2019t make at least on the reported numbers; we didn\u2019t necessarily make progress during 2013. Consumer is at about 54% efficiency ratio for both 2013 and 2012. There we think that as we begin to get more of a rollout of our drive to common efforts rolling our rainbow and standardizing the platforms for the retail banking and cards businesses. We think then that\u2019s really going to begin to see some more efficiency improvements in consumer. So that is something that you should continue to see, you should start to see in 2014 and then continue into 2015.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Could you remind us on these repositioning expenses, what are the nature of these and why are they persisting at such a high rate? I think you indicated they might stay in the $250 million range for the first half of the year and then you expect them to come down?","John Gerspach","Yes, let\u2019s just -- I mean the first half of the year we still think is going to be elevated and when you take a look at what we anticipate, we still needing to do in the first half of the year. We still are looking to reduce our global real estate footprint. We still have facilities that are just larger than we currently need based upon how we\u2019ve been able to reduce headcount and there is still facilities, there is leases that we need to exit. Part of the issue when it comes to real estate John is we can\u2019t just book reserves in advance of exiting the premises. Your reserve has to be taken after or in the same period that you\u2019ve actually left the building and so there would be more of that. We are still in the process of rationalizing our branch network in the U.S. You\u2019ve seen some of the announcements that we\u2019ve made regarding branches in Texas and elsewhere. Again, we can make announcements that we\u2019re closing down the branches, but the repositioning expenses to get out of those branches only happen when we\u2019ve actually left the premises. And as I mentioned as we rollout rainbow and we move towards standard platforms in consumer, certainly throughout 2014 there is going to be repositioning cost that we take as we continue to streamline the operations. It\u2019s not just about moving on to standard platforms. Now once we move on to standard platforms you want to standardize your processes around -- across the globe. And so that is going to incur some level of repositioning as we move forward. And then we will continue to look at delayering and rational -- rationalization of management structure throughout our businesses.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","When you talk about getting to the efficiency targets in 2015, that includes repositioning expenses, right?","John Gerspach","Yes. When we\u2019ve given you the targets for 2015, they have been all inclusive.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","John Gerspach","Go ahead.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","And on the ROA and ROE side of the targets, the 1% ROA or average and the ROE of 10%, those goals for 2015, what are the drivers there? Are you relying on a -- I hope that the legal costs come down to get you there or what else can help you get to that \u2013 those profitability goals?","John Gerspach","Well, don\u2019t forget as we continue to improve the efficiency that should improve results in Citicorp and the biggest driving -- one of the big driving factors that I think we\u2019ve mentioned is don\u2019t forget those goals that we laid out for ROA and ROTCE were at the Citigroup level. And so we continue to look to drive Citi Holdings close to breakeven.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And one other question John on net interest income you mentioned that the margin outlook for the year of flattish at the 285 of \u201913, but you ended the year at higher than that and you added Best Buy in the fourth quarter, just kind of thinking about net interest income dollars, was there anything one time-ish about that strong $12 billion NII number that you\u2019re exiting the year at and is there any reason that\u2019s not a good starting point to try to grow off this year?","John Gerspach","No John I\u2019m a little cautious always when it comes to trying to forecast out NIM. There is a component of NIM that gets impacted by our trading business and that can have some variability in it. So I think by -- if you think about where we started this year, my guidance coming into this year was that I expected NIM to be at or around the 282 that we had for overall 2012. We actually finished little higher at 285. I feel pretty comfortable just then establishing the fact that we will try to keep it constant going in to next year. But obviously if loan yields can improve a bit and if we can continue to lower the cost of our funding profile, there could be some upside to that number. But let\u2019s leave it at our expectations being at or around the 285 for now.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","I was really thinking about the dollars John, your full year NII dollars was 46.8, you ended the year with a $12 billion quarter and you have Best Buy now. So any reason on a dollar basis that NII wouldn\u2019t be higher in '14 versus '13 with the Best Buy portfolio?","Mike Corbat","No, you're absolutely right. The NII dollars should continue to be there, but again when it looks at NIM, you have to take that over your average earning assets. And so right now we're saying NIM would stay about flat. But the NII should be \u2013 there's no reason to think that it's going to decline from where we were in 2013.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Right, the 12 going into this quarter is a good starting off point on dollars, it seems like that.","Mike Corbat","It's a good starting off point, John, but there's always likely to be some variability and don't forget when you get into things like NII, you get impacted by day count and everything else. So, certainly as you look towards the first quarter, just the way the calendar works, there happen to be two less days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So you can look at the fourth quarter 12 billion, but that's 92 days and there aren't 92 days in the first quarter.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein","Got it, thanks.","Mike Corbat","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Thanks. So I want to ask a big picture question about securities and banking and it goes towards John's question towards building, towards those 15 targets. And I guess the first part of it is if you think there's seasonality component that's heavily weighted in the first half, because if you look at your progression, it's there. So when you look at fourth quarter, it looks like you underperformed peer group. When you look at the full year, your revenues are in line, your expenses are down and you should be happy. But the problem is, is getting from current earnings to what people need to see to hit your targets in '15, this is my words, I think the investment bank is a huge contributor on whether or not you get there, so I'm curious to see if a, you think there is a big seasonality that we should be expecting and b, what specifically at the IB is going to help us drive towards those targets now that you're doing your job on the expense side or so it seems?","John Gerspach","Yes, I'm going to turn it over to Mike but when you talk about seasonality, there is certainly some seasonality involved but I think you have to take a look at a big change in environment that happened first half versus second half this year. When we started out, it was a much more positive environment and then the second half as we got into the whole concept of said tapering, government slowdown, that changed the environment. It made it a much more cautious environment in the second half of the year, and certainly beginning in the third quarter and that certainly contributed, I think, a lot to what we saw as far as revenue production in the third and fourth quarter. Mike?","Mike Corbat","Yes, I agree with that. I think, Glenn, when you look at the year and as we go through our numbers, I think you've kind of looked that you can't just take a quarter like the fourth quarter, you can't take a quarter like the first quarter and simply annualize. I think you've got to look at the environment and I think as we look at the second half of the year, probably really starting in some ways with Bernanke's May 22nd talk and then through the summer on EM concerns and then as we entered the end of the third quarter and went into the fourth quarter in terms of government shutdown, we had a number of factors that we had to deal with in there. As I look at our S&P franchise and in particular as I look at our fixed income businesses, there's nothing in here that causes me concern in terms of our positioning. I think that we're going to through a transitioning policy environment, through a transitioning rate environment, my guess is we'll have better quarters, we'll have less good quarters but our goal over the longer term is to continue to take market share. And again I think when you look at our full year we've done that. Clearly we didn't do that when we isolate the fourth quarter. I think when you look at our path to the targets that in spite of the environment we're in, we did grow revenues 4% across S&P and I think that while you could have a more challenging parts of fixed income environment, I think you've seen the work in the investment that we've put in, in the investment bank starting to pay. I think you can see that some of the work we've done around equities starting to pay, but I think in each of those we've got more to do. But I think from that through being focused on market share gains, expensed disciplines, I think we've got the ability to continue to grow bottom line in that business.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","All right, just one follow-up on S&P. You've mentioned the 4% revenue growth in that environment, Mike, and I hear you on change in environment. Can you talk about comp specifically because there's a big piece of expenses and you guys disclosed differently or should I say don't disclose comp ratio and comp dollars, just given the improvement and efficiencies, just curious on how people should be thinking about if environment does get a little bit better, the operating leverage in S&P?","John Gerspach","Glenn, let me pipe in for a second. The efficiency ratio in ICG, as we said, has been steadily coming down. And what I thought I mentioned during my \u2013 running through this slide is that compensation definitely played a role there. And when you take a look at ICG, we actually had a comp ratio of 29% for 2013.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","And what was that last year, in '12 just so we have the comparisons?","John Gerspach","It's down from last year. Again, this is the first time we've disclosed it, so let's just establish the fact that it's at 29%.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, I appreciate that. The comment on Korea caught my attention. Correct me if I'm wrong it sounded like a little bit better timing wise in terms of when that might flatten out and improve. Is that correct and does that make much of a difference on the P&L because it's obviously being weighing down the rest of Asia which has been fine?","John Gerspach","I'd say it's more a firming of the timeline. When we mentioned at the end, back in October that it should stabilize sometime in early 2014, it sounds like it's six months away. I think now when you hear it and you're sitting in January, it's something that could happen within the next three months. So it's certainly \u2013 we have reaffirmed, I think, the guidance that we gave you last year as far as our belief that those Korean revenues should stabilize. And we think that's going to have an impact on the overall growth trend in Asia. If you go back, Glenn, to the beginning of 2012, at the point in time, Korea \u2013 consumer loans in Korea represented 34% or so of the loans that we have in the Asia consumer franchise. Since that time we've been reducing the loans in Korea, Korea loans have come down about $5 billion during those ensuing eight quarters while you've seen the loan growth that we've had in Asia and that's now all because of the loan growth that we're getting out of Hong Kong, out of Singapore, out of India. So, we're getting loan growth and so now Korea loans represent something like 27% of the loans that we have in our Asia consumer franchise. And the reductions \u2013 the sequential reductions in the Korea loan book have begun to slow and so we see the revenue stabilizing early in 2014 and then you should get a much better view then as far as the underlying growth that we're actually generating in some of those other geographies, those other countries in Asia.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. Last one, I appreciate that John. The Springleaf IPO that's similar to something that you got inside Holdings and I know you've been asked questions on this in the past, but now that it's public, now that the stock has done well, does that mean there's a potentially better funding environment to do something strategic there whether it be sale partnership or IPO in a similar manner?","Mike Corbat","Glenn, we've been \u2013 as you may know we've been pretty closely involved with Springleaf in terms of helping them go out and raise funding as well as being a lead in terms of the IPO, so I think we've got a pretty good sense of that. And I think it goes back to what we've talked about that when we think the environment's right such that we can be paid value for that business, it's a business that is a terrific business but it's a business that's non-core to really what Citi is. So we're continuing to explore options with that business and when the time is right we're certainly going to be prepared to move on it.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, appreciate the answers. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities","Hi, guys.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Matt.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities","Just drilling down the expense outlook of flat to down, can you give us a sense of how much savings are still to come from the various repositioning that you've done, then how much might be just kind of natural expense creep and if there's a component that's discretionary in terms of investment spend? Or if that's not the right way to think about it, how should we kind of think about the components?","John Gerspach","Well the only savings that we\u2019ve actually talked about, by the way we\u2019ve talked publicly about is specially linked to the repositioning was the $1 billion charge that we took in the fourth quarter of last year and we said that the anticipation was that, that would generate savings of about $1.2 billion annually, $900 million or so in 2013 with an annual run rate of $1.2 billion and we\u2019ve hit that. So you\u2019ve got that in the numbers. The rest of the repositioning action that we\u2019ve taken when we\u2019ve showed you at least the amounts that we\u2019ve done, there had been much smaller actions as we have gone through the year other than the fourth quarter where we went up to $234 million.","I think the average run rate for the other three quarters was something in the $100 million to $115 million range. But it's all these types of actions that I laid out as far as the types of things that we\u2019d be looking to do in 2014 it's de-layering of -- it's taking our management layers, it's repositioning the branch footprint et cetera, et cetera and all of those things are contributing to the expense base -- the overall expense base.","We have had some as you\u2019d put it expense creep. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily refer to it as creep, but we do continue to invest in expanding our marketing programs of expenses associated with new product launches and development. So all of that we would think about as being investment spending as far as going into -- which will eventually yield to growth in revenues.","So we have, I think at a going forward basis the expectation would be that as long as we\u2019re in a -- as we would say a low single digit revenue growth environment we\u2019re going to continue to make some investments to achieve that revenue growth, but overall the impact of the repositioning actions should offset the cost of those investments. On top of that we haven't really spelled this out in any great degree of specificity but we have had and have been absorbing higher amounts of regulatory related expenses.","I think I mentioned that during the script, but if you take a look at our regulatory expense build, year-over-year I think we grew our regulatory related expenses, expenses associated with everything from AML to compliance et cetera, et cetera by about $300 million. So that expense growth that we got this year that has been more than offset by some of the efficiency programs over two years it's probably -- there was probably an additional $200 million to $300 million that we had in expense growth in 2012 over 2011 level, and it's just based upon the way we\u2019re looking at 2014 we\u2019re likely to have an additional $200 million to $300 million of incremental regulatory expense in 2014, all of which we expect to be able to cover.","So when I say expenses flat to down it means we\u2019re covering the incremental regulatory expenses, it means covering the incremental investment spend or with repositioning actions. And obviously if the environment changes, if we end up with an environment that doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to get any revenue growth then we\u2019ll take other actions.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay, it's helpful color. And then just separately within the equity trading, you have been gaining a lot of momentum there at the last few quarters, and I can appreciate any one given quarter there can be some noise, but just -- I mean is that kind of just a blip you think in terms of the progress that you have made there especially in the equity derivative side or is there something else that we should be thinking about?","John Gerspach","Matt, you\u2019re referring to the quarter-over-quarter performance. I think as we look, I think on a relative basis as you look across and we\u2019ll see where everybody finishes. I think we\u2019re appearing to be kind of roughly in line in terms of our equity performance albeit coming from a lower base. But from our perspective as John described, I don\u2019t think on the derivative side yet we\u2019ve got trading where we\u2019d like it to be. And so I think that unfortunately none of this is linear, but I think we\u2019re making progress and I think in \u201914 we\u2019ll continue to make progress on that.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","John Gerspach","Okay, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Jim.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Hi, just maybe a quick question maybe following up on the prior question on fixed income in a couple of ways. If we look at the last couple of quarters, at Citi Holdings, your balance sheet really has been pretty flat. Given your capital strength and I think trading assets were down, I mean, given your capital strength and the potential that some of your peers overseas are de-leveraging to you. Why shouldn\u2019t we start seeing that part -- that grow? What needs to get, what needs to happen if you are to get more comfortable in growing your balance sheet given your capital strength?","John Gerspach","Well I think that, as you look at a couple of pieces, I think one is I think that some of the transition or uncertainty kind of coming through the summer months around some of the transition of rates in the EM and whether it's against the bits economy and some of those that came under pressure. I think that we have had some of our trading desk probably trading closer to home and probably for parts of the second and the half of the year been more risk off. But again I think as our trading desk see opportunities they are free to go after them. So, I\u2019d say there\u2019s nothing prescribed here, but I think our trading desk in parts of the world decided to take some risk off as we got into the second half of the year.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","That makes sense. Just maybe as a follow up to that, we have had the fed decide to taper, we do have a budget deal, do you think that has changed at all the tone when you talk to your trading desk of things feeling a little bit better as we go into \u201814 or no?","John Gerspach","Yeah, I think so. I think you have conversations probably Jim that range from things feel less bad to conversations that actually things are feeling better. And I think when you look around the world, I think in some ways 2013 probably surprised itself in terms of what happened from growth. We had a number of revisions out of some of the big countries, big regions down. And I think as you look across the globe in 2014 you\u2019ve got most of those areas at a minimum stabilized and in many areas coming back up. So I think that people feel and you can look at the way on the fixed income side you\u2019re trading. I think people certainly feel much more comfortable with the taper, the $10 billion a month taper today versus where we were five or six months ago. So the answer I think is, yes. I think the environment is better.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful, and just one last question on transaction services. I would appreciate the challenging rate environment, but I guess I\u2019m just getting, struggling with big volume growth but flat revenues across the board. It seems like your NIM overall has been pretty stable; what is unique to that business that you\u2019re still seeing big compression in spreads?","John Gerspach","I wouldn\u2019t say it's anything unique to that business. When you take a look at our transaction services business it really is just similar to any other deposit business where you\u2019ve seen the impact of spread compression and it's just the, one of the ways that we get paid for doing cash management work is through balances that people leave with us.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Fair, but I think it seems like if we look at your competitors in disclosures, deposit spreads have been pretty stable over the last one of two quarters, just wondering why we\u2019re not starting to see a little bit more impact on revenues from volume growth.","John Gerspach","Actually all I can tell you is that we\u2019re continuing to see the volume growth just able to offset the spread compression.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Thank you. Good morning.","John Gerspach","Hi, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Well, I guess probably by now good afternoon. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the decline that you -- in FICC. You talked about spread products in particular securitized, but I guess also credit and I just wanted to get some clarity on how much of that decline was emerging markets as opposed to more domestic stuff?","John Gerspach","Guy, when we talk about the decline I just want to make sure that I answer your question. You\u2019re talking about the sequential decline?","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Actually both; the sequential and the year-over-year.","John Gerspach","All right. Then from a sequential -- I\u2019ll be very specific. On a sequential basis as I said, when we take a look at rates and currencies and the environment in which it was operating and in the fourth quarter very similar to third quarter, low single digit reduction in revenues and no real noticeable fall off have with anything to do with the emerging markets because the environment was the same. When you take a look at year-over-year we did have a bit more of a drop off in rates and currencies on a year-over-year basis and the bulk of that drop off would have been seen in the emerging markets, just a change in sentiment from where we were at the tail end of last year to where we were at the end of 2013 regarding emerging markets and that has been reflected in our year-over-year rates and currencies. And I think if you go back and if you remember when I said it, it was probably a year ago and probably in the first quarter, pretty complementary of our trading desk saying that I felt our trading desk in particular in the EM had done an exceptional job in terms of trading QE of the intermediation between central banks, financial institutions, corporate users, et cetera. And I think clearly really for mid year on, we've seen a slowing of that QE-related activity.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it, that's helpful. And I think I heard John say that the linked quarter increase in RWA density and I guess just RWAs was pretty much all driven by operational risks, in turn would that just be the higher litigation costs over the last year?","John Gerspach","Guy, you did hear that correctly. And it's driven by the higher level of litigation related activity throughout the industry. It's much more of an assessment of what's going on in the industry. When we take a look at operational risk in our various businesses, we have to look both at ourselves but also at the industry as far as measuring the type of operational risks that our businesses face. So it's very much our view as to what's happening not just with us, but with some of the other things that you've seen hit the press as far as the industry.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. So if a couple of your very large competitors had some outside issues, ultimately that does impact to some extent your own operational risk?","John Gerspach","That is correct, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, that helps too. As we think about those litigation costs, I think I heard you hinting that going forward into 2014 we should probably keep something like the same run rate. Is that all the way through the year?","John Gerspach","I'm just going to leave it that we think that given the current environment you should anticipate legal and related expenses staying at elevated levels.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And how does that intersect with the baseline kind of $44.2 billion or $44.3 billion of operating expense? That should come above and beyond that as we think about that, I just want to make sure I'm clear on what's done?","John Gerspach","Yes, Guy. That would be above the $43 billion number we talked about.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And reposition ongoing sort of low level but persistent repositioning charges, those are outside of that number too or in it?","John Gerspach","Those are outside of that number that I was specifically talking about, but they are in when we talk about achieving the efficiency ratios for 2015.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it, by which time of course as you pointed out you should be getting some of the benefit of the earlier ones.","John Gerspach","Correct.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And then a final one from me, the runoff in Holdings slowed and continued but it did slow in the quarter quite a bit. Any sense that you can share with us as to why that happened?","John Gerspach","Yes, I think \u2013 again, we're opportunistic in terms of what the market offers us and in this case again, we'll take advantage of any prices out there where we think that the sale of that and the combination of reduced expenses, derisking give up in terms of revenue where those trade-offs make sense, I think in the fourth quarter there was probably less of those but again I think as we think about the Holdings portfolio, I would say from a primary objective it is to drive Holdings to breakeven as soon as practically possible. And again, at this point we've got Holdings assets below 6% of GAAP assets for the firm, it's not a meaningful number in terms of the overall area of the firm and again, it's the optimization of how we continue to wind that down with an emphasis on getting it to break even.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, fair enough. So you're still obviously exploring opportunities as they make sense to sell chunks [ph]?","John Gerspach","Absolutely.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Great, thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Guy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead with your question.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit about, just kind of an accounting technical question. Is there any way that you could have \u2013 Citi Holdings is getting smaller, take that and almost put it into discontinued operations as you're really looking to make a B breakeven, and then it just kind of comes off the income statement?","John Gerspach","Marty, no, the answer is no.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","So there's no way that you could envision being able to lengthen it sort of enough to separate it out?","John Gerspach","No, there isn't.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. The other thing was as we saw some of the securities and capital market revenues come in, we haven't seen the expenses come down as quickly. Does that reflect more of a \u2013 kind of a fixed base there a little bit more than the bearable base, and as you see them pop back up in revenues, will expenses stay relatively flat and not offset a lot of rebound you might see in the first half of the year?","John Gerspach","Well, Marty, when we tend to look at these things, we tend to look at full year efficiency ratios. And again, I think if you take a look at what we've done with securities and banking over the course of the full year, we have taken expenses down, expenses have come down as we said by 3% as we've actually grown revenues 4%. And when you take a look at the efficiency ratios that we now have in securities and banking, we've gone from something north of 60% to where this year, for 2013, we've now reduced the efficiency or improved the efficiency ratio to 59%. So we're really conscious of taking expenses out. You may not see the variability quarter-to-quarter but you should certainly see it year-over-year and we think that we've been able to make fairly steady progress on that front in securities and banking.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","All right, I think we can see that efficiency kind of coming through the numbers, I'm just wondering on the variability tying one to the other versus kind of setting a base that's in your building efficiencies, what you think you're going to produce and then you get the kind of positive variability and upticks as you might get in revenue?","John Gerspach","Yes. And again when you take a look at ICG overall, as we said, our comp ratio and that certainly is a lot when it comes to the extent that you've got variability, you might think of it at least traditionally in terms of comp. Our comp ratio right now in our institutional business is at 29% and of course embedded in that would be the truly variable aspect of it which would be incentive compensation, which is obviously lower than 29%. So you have to take in terms of variability with some of those constraints.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","And then just lastly the steepening of the yield curve, what kind of things are you seeing that might help just the net interest margin to be able to remain with some of the gains you've seen here recently? Is there some favorable inner spreads on the trading account or just reinvestment yields being higher that might \u2013 if we can keep the yield curve at this level and be positive going into 2014?","John Gerspach","Well, as far as we're concerned the biggest help would be some movement on the short end of the curve. We've begun to see some movement in the 5-year to 10-year maybe as low as the 3, but the short end of the curve has been pretty flat. And we are positioned to benefit from a rise in rates but it's really going to have to come more on the short end to really get the lion share of the benefit.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","Thanks.","John Gerspach","Okay, Marty, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, how are you?","Mike Corbat","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","So a couple of questions. One, you indicated earlier the mortgage MSR sale that you are just beginning to do. Can you just give us some color on how you're thinking about how that's going to be impacting expenses? I know you indicated it was predominately delinquency related, so you could help us out there that would be helpful. Plus RWA reduction in Holdings, is it going to have some noticeable impacts there?","Mike Corbat","Let me take the second one first, no. You're not going to see because it's mortgaging servicing, these aren't on balance sheet assets, so you're really not going to see a change in the Holdings RWA\u2026","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Sure. No, I was just hopeful on operational risk or something like that, but I guess not, okay.","John Gerspach","When you think in terms of operational risk, I wish it was simply as easy as you take an action and you see a result. What happens with operational risk is someone else takes an action and that causes you to really need to add to your operational risk. And then it takes three, five years for that operational risk to eventually kind of wash out. So unfortunately operational risk has a long half life and it's just going to be with us for a while, but getting back to your original question Betsy as far the mortgage sale, I think the biggest benefit you\u2019re going to see there would be from an expense point of view. When it comes to processing or servicing delinquent loan, that\u2019s probably -- that other than foreclosed loans, that\u2019s the most expensive loan processing that we have. And just to give you a frame of reference, a non-performing loan you can have annual servicing fees of 15, 20, 25 times the size of the annual servicing fee for a performing loan. So when -- it may sound like it\u2019s a small sale, but again its 20% of the 60 plus day delinquent loan book in Citi Mortgage and so that\u2019s pretty important.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then on repositioning charges that you indicated the first half of \u201914 could be running at similar to 4Q13. Is that -- are those repositioning charges for first half \u201914 related to things you\u2019ve already announced like the Texas sale and the Philadelphia exit or does that also include things you haven\u2019t yet announced?","John Gerspach","It would include things that we\u2019ve not yet announced.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then lastly just on -- I want to make sure I understand what you were saying about the American Airlines credit card. Are you saying that you want that going forward for American and U.S airlines merger?","John Gerspach","What we\u2019ve right now is an agreement with our partner American Airlines that when they merge the two frequent flyer programs and they anticipate doing that in around mid 2015. At that point in time we will have exclusive rights to issue cards.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So did you have to pay anything to get those rights?","John Gerspach","We are not release in terms of the agreement at this point in time, okay?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. But anything that was in that -- is in this quarter\u2019s run rate?","John Gerspach","Exactly.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Great. Okay. All right, thanks.","John Gerspach","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Just to confirm John, so are you committing to show -- for Citi to show positive operating leverage in 2014? I know you said expenses should be flat to lower, but is that assuming revenues will be higher?","John Gerspach","I didn\u2019t say anything about committing Citi to positive operating leverage for 2014. That\u2019s not something that I\u2019m going to talk about right now Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. Is that because you aren\u2019t sure if you will get it or you don\u2019t give that sort of forecast or \u2026?","John Gerspach","That\u2019s rather a long range forecast. We don\u2019t do things like try to guide you quarter-by-quarter on earnings. So I will give you general expense guidance as far as what we\u2019re trying to do with expenses and expenses again and I couched it with assuming there was going to be a low single-digit revenue growth rate in Citicorp that we would expect that operating expense to -- to be at or below. But there is a whole other slew of items such as things that we don\u2019t know about and what I\u2019ve talked about thus far is the legal environment. Right now we\u2019d anticipate that being continued elevated, but I\u2019m certainly not going to forecast where legal expenses are going to be for the year and that would certainly drive into a lot as to whether or not we\u2019re going to have a (technical difficulty) leverage going into next year.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. Well maybe my follow-up is for Mike. I think your message has resonated with a good group of people in terms of managing Citigroup more as a portfolio businesses where you have optionality. You have that chart with resource allocation with your four buckets optimize and grow, invest to grow, optimize, restructure, stay the course. So I\u2019m just wondering when you\u2019re going to take another move as you say it\u2019s an uncertain and challenging environment and it's tough to make two strong a forecast, Citigroup has missed earnings expectations two quarters in a row. Citigroup is the only big bank that trades below tangible book value and it\u2019s been not quite a year since your March 5 presentation. So as an analyst I feel as though I\u2019ve been watching this movie and personally I\u2019ve liked what I\u2019ve seen for the first year, but I feel like I\u2019m at intermission now on the second box of popcorn waiting for your next act. And when do we get to see more about the restructuring at Citigroup?","Mike Corbat","Well I think when you look Mike, if you look at 2013 and you look at what we manage to accomplish in essence in the first half of the your movie or in your first box of popcorn, we had revenues up, we had expenses down, we grew EBIT by 28%, net income by 15%. We grew loans, we grew deposits, we shrunk holdings by 25%, we significantly increased our capital. We used DTA, we explicitly used foreign tax credits that are on the clock and so when we look at and as we\u2019ve described for 2014 as John has used the words, we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on our execution. And we think the environment economically while getting better remains challenging, low single digit revenue growth. We got to be mindful of expenses and I think it when you look at the drivers in our business we\u2019re making progress against it and whether that\u2019s deposit growth, loan growth, purchase card sales, you go through the check list of those things and the fundamentals are there and for \u201914 we\u2019re going to stay focused on doing that.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Well John mentioned that some of the repositioning charges ahead are for some actions not yet taken. Can you give us any sort of preview of where you\u2019re looking?","Mike Corbat","Well the way I would describe it Mike and we\u2019ve talked about it before is that what we\u2019re really trying to do is drive the mentality into the business of are businesses making decisions of how and where and with whom they should be doing their business. And rather than having the series of one-offs, I want to become to work towards in essence as you\u2019ve described this portfolio of businesses that we need to make sure we\u2019re optimizing and running in the right way. And I think in there what you would see is a continued series of business moves I don\u2019t think I would sweep it all together and ascribe a big fundamental change to the company or to the strategy.","John Gerspach","But it builds on the optimization bucket and lot of the actions Mike that that we\u2019re talking about doing in early in 2014 would fall into that bucket of optimize. We got countries where we can still rationalize our branch footprint and take out expenses and so that really is just continuing the execution on the strategy that Mike talked about last March.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Maybe as a follow-up and more specifically page 5 of your March 5 presentation from last year Mike, you talked about the execution priorities and Citi Holdings wind down. I mean, you\u2019ve made great progress year-over-year, it's kind of like if I look at the year it seems like big progress, but the quarter wasn\u2019t great progress. The question is are you temporarily stalled or should we see a redemption of greater DTA utilization in the quarters ahead, greater Citi Holdings wind down ahead and greater expense reductions ahead?","Mike Corbat","Again, I think that we\u2019ve got to look what\u2019s obviously in the best interest of our stakeholders and shareholders and when you look at what the world like, what our shareholders want us to describe value simply to get a headline GAAP reduction in Citi Holdings. As John said I think we\u2019ve made real progress in terms of reducing that drag and today largely what we\u2019re faced with is the legal build around legacy issues. We can\u2019t control those. So we\u2019re not going to make silly choices to simply sell assets to get a reduction in assets as opposed to really trying to manage in the round risk reduction, expense reduction against give up of income and net income against that.","John Gerspach","And Mike when you talk about the DTA and this is (technical difficulty) building on what Mike just said, when you look at our DTA utilization for the year and I mentioned the number of 2.4 billion, that basically all came out of earnings. When you take a look at the impact on DTA utilization through other comprehensive income, it was basically nothing, it was just flat. But if you break the earnings component down, we had our Citicorp businesses utilize $3.3 billion of DTA and the losses that we continued to have in Holdings actually created 900 million. That's one of the reasons why driving Holdings down to breakeven is so important because we think again that will allow our investors to see the full capacity that our franchise has for utilizing that DTA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then last follow-up. I mean you have said this before, to the extent that housing has improved, liquidity has improved, stock markets have improved, that should improve your optionality to take more aggressive actions. So that better environment combined again with the stock trading below tangible book value, doesn't that make you want to be a lot more aggressive or at least a little bit more aggressive?","Mike Corbat","Again, I think that we've got a footprint as I've spoken about that is unique and it's up to us to get the most out it. You saw us during the course of the year Turkey, Paraguay, Uruguay continuing to rationalize a consumer footprint, and again I think we'll continue to look at those things on the edges but I don't want to mislead you, Mike. We're not looking for any big move here in terms of the strategy of the firm.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right, thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. John, in your comments about your FICC trading numbers on a full year this year versus last year you mentioned that there was a change of sentiment in the emerging markets which caused the trading to be weaker. Was that due to the U.S. government shutdown in the middle of the year? What do you think caused the changes in the sentiment in the emerging markets?","Mike Corbat","Gerard, it's Mike. I think we've pointed to a couple of things. I think one, I think clearly there was a concern or a sentiment shift for a period of time after Chairman Bernanke's comments on May 22nd. I think for a period of time people were uncertain as to how they were thinking about that. I think we then went into a period of time where people were worried about this rate transition and in particular an essence those budget deficit economies and we had the evolution of the bits or the fives that came out of that and some concerns reemerged around the emerging economies. I think we then went into September and October we started to really enter into some of the Washington in pass-around budget, et cetera and I think it was kind of a combination of those things really throughout the latter half of the second into the third and fourth quarter that I think weighed on people.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. And in regards to your comments on the operational risk, how it's increased the denominator in the equation, can you guys quantify for us the basis points, how much it's costing you in the ratio from a basis point perspective? Is it 30 basis points?","John Gerspach","No. When you work it all the way through, it's somewhere in the vicinity of 50 basis points.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And John you guys pointed out you had some success in selling some of those mortgages, I believe, inside of Citi Holdings. What did you receive in terms of a price versus your carrying value?","John Gerspach","Are you talking about the sale that we just announced as far as the nonperforming loans because that was backed out of our servicing portfolio or are you back to the 400 million or so of loan sales that we had during the quarter? I just want to be\u2026","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, the 400 million that you mentioned, correct, in the fourth quarter.","John Gerspach","There's not significant economies associated with that sale.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. In terms of the Basel III SIN [ph] buckets that all the banks are dealing with, what do you have left to monetize so that you can kind of reduce some of them?","John Gerspach","I'm sorry, the Basel III SIN buckets\u2026","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, sure, where you've got to deduct that from your capital. Obviously the DTA is the big one but there are all the equity ownerships.","John Gerspach","Okay, exactly. Well, we still have the equity ownership that we have through our partnership with LQIF, so that's our ownership interest in Banco de Chile. And that is still there. And the other one of size would be our investment in Guangfa Bank in China.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. The other I guess final one is any color or refinement you can give us about the CCAR, how it went in terms of how you guys got your arms around it and what do you think the expectations are?","John Gerspach","No. We've made our submission and we'll be waiting like everybody else for the early March results.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Hi, guys. A couple of questions in terms of the regulatory costs that you mentioned in terms of being embedded in that 44 billion plus kind of core run rate, each year kind of 200 million, 300 million incrementally this year as well. Are those costs that are kind of permanent each year or are we kind of coming to an end in terms of this year at least as far as you can tell that might be the last of it and are those permanent or will those then reverse at some point?","Mike Corbat","I would say very, very few of them will reverse. I think that those are just the incremental costs of doing business now for banks and I don't think we're the only bank that's going through that. So those are just costs that are going to be embedded in our expense base going forward as we need to meet new requirements. And there still is some expense billed. I don't want to categorically say that 2014 is the last billed in that expense base, but I guess we're all sort of hopeful that certainly, in the near term, you'll start to see some of those incremental expenses, the growth rate abate.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Got it, that's helpful. So it sounds like those are in response to kind of new evolving regulatory burdens rather than kind of catch up and so they may be related to the changed kind of guidelines on CCAR, CLAR counterparty credit risk, et cetera. Is that fair versus kind of a catch up?","Mike Corbat","I'd say it's a combination of \u2013 and it depends on how you think about the catch up, but it's in the areas that you noted but it's also in other important areas as far as anti-money laundering and KYC and some of the mortgage-related expenses where we've got enhanced requirements. So I'd say it's a combination of new things as well as I guess what you could say are enhanced expectations on the part of various regulatory bodies as to how you're going to comply with various regulations.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Thanks. And then I'll try another way at it. In terms of the expense base on a core basis, you mentioned that kind of a low revenue type backdrop. If the revenue environment ends up being ultimately worse than that, right, if it's flat or down, could it be down even more or are there additional levers in the door to pull if that were to play out?","Mike Corbat","Yes, I would say that certainly the first thing that you would do if the environment looked like it was going to be even more challenging than we think it was going to be, the first thing you would stop is, you'd stop a certain amount of investment spending. And so that would be an immediate lever that you could pull. If you thought it was going to go deeper than that, you would re-pace other things. We might re-pace some of the other systems work that we're doing. You would then also take a look at various \u2013 the capacity that you've got in different businesses. So there's many levers that you can pull depending upon your view of the economy and the degree to which you think that the economy will differ from what you've got baked into your base plan.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Thanks. And then separately around the operational respect going up for you and others this last quarter in the capital calculation, I hear you on legal factors for all. Is it also related potentially to counterparty credit risk that was kind of a new factor thrown in for the CCAR this upcoming process in terms of top 20, top 50 in terms of monitoring them on a pretty regular basis, and how do you think that that may or may not impact CCAR process generally? And maybe for you just as a reminder that it seems like you'd probably be in a better position, especially now that you have \u2013 the government kind of out of your house on the FDIC TruPS as well for the first time? Thanks.","Mike Corbat","Just to start with one other question that you posed, the new requirement that got baked into this year's CCAR, that didn't contribute anything towards our reassessment of our operational risk weighted assets. That couldn\u2019t play a role in that at all. That was really just taking a look at the legal and regulatory environment that we currently see. As far as how that particular requirement, that particular added requirement impacted the CCAR test. We factored it in, and we didn\u2019t see that it posed any significant constraint on us, but it was just another one of these interesting twists that we\u2019re going to have to deal with I think in each CCAR. I think it's good on the part of the fed so that they\u2019re constantly changing things up and making you think about new different risks and so I actually think that putting in new requirements like that benefits the industry.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","All right, thanks. And then just lastly on SMB, mentioned how the environment muted in the fourth quarter and maybe third quarter as well last year. Maybe I missed it, did you -- have you commented in terms of has that turned early this year so far and how does that maybe specifically effect business get impacted from QE tapering near-term, long-term. Is it a net positive, net negative; how should we kind of think about it?","John Gerspach","Well it's a little difficult to judge a quarter or a year based upon the first 10 or so trading days. So I don\u2019t want to go too far out there. But I would say certainly the first 10 days of January look a lot better than what we saw in December and November, so I\u2019d go that far.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","And QE tapering does that have an impact in a meaningful way one way or the other or higher loan rates?","John Gerspach","The difficult again -- rates shot up for a while and just when everybody got comfortable with, I\u2019d say the 10 year being something at around 3% or higher you had the jobs reports come in last Friday and suddenly the 10 year rate drops down to something with a 2, 8 handle. So I think that we all like to see a rate view that settles out and it's better when everyone has a view towards rates gradually increasing or gradually decreasing whichever you can deal with. The problem is we\u2019re still dancing around things and so there\u2019s a little bit more volatility than you can, then I would say is optimal at this point in time and that\u2019s just -- that just continues the general uncertainty regarding the economy.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners","Thanks, John.","John Gerspach","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks. I just had a follow up on some of the DTA comments. I guess one broad one is the DTA was down $2.4 billion as you suggested. It's still kind of above year end 2011 levels and I was wondering if we could see an acceleration of the utilization next year. And in line with that one of the things Mike had said was that, you did make progress against the foreign tax credit portion of the DTA that does start to run out meaningfully in 2016 and 2017, and I was wondering if you could give us some numbers behind that, how much of that was foreign tax credit utilization?","John Gerspach","Yes, sure Fred. Let's start with the last one. As far as the foreign tax credit utilization, now we as Mike and I said, we utilized about during the year $2 billion of the FTC carry forward and you can just, all you have to do is just open up last year's 10K and its $2 billion off of the schedule based upon when they run out. So I think there was $400 million or so that was due to expire in 2015; that would now go away.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","John Gerspach","And then there was $6.6 billion I believe that was due to expire in 2016, so then that now would be reduced by $1.6 billion, so we would be down to $5 billion there. So pretty much it follows the schedule.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful.","John Gerspach","All right. And then as far as what can we do next year on DTA, and from your other comment, again I\u2019d point you to some of the comments I made earlier. When you take a look at the $2.4 billion that we utilized this year, $3.3 billion of that came from Citi Corp earnings and then we had the Citi Holdings losses actually work against us to the tune of about $900 million. So what we can certainly do to continue to increase the utilization of DTA is really to get those holdings losses closer to breakeven and that would allow more of that $3.3 billion of Citi Corp utilization than to drop through to the bottom line.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And I think, just as a follow you have talked in the past about kind of meeting North American earnings to utilize the DTA. Is that more related to getting the Citi Holdings down or is it other activity in North America?","John Gerspach","Well, it's also growing North America earnings. So certainly as we begin to see our branded cards business revitalize as we hopefully get some earnings out of the Best Buy acquisition, all of those things should be positive towards our North America earnings as well.","Frederick Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Not a problem, Fred.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Thanks. It's Derek here. I have couple of questions. Just coming back to securities and banking kind of the glide path to your 2015 target. Your 75 basis points ROA in the division for the full-year, and I\u2019m just wondering where does that number have to be to kind of get you with the business mix and everything to your 90 to 110; does that have to be at 90 or is it 75 or 100, where does that have to be?","John Gerspach","Derek, we didn\u2019t give specific targets business by business because again we wanted to make sure that people understood that what we were focused on was improving the ROA for Citigroup as a whole. But you\u2019re quite right; we would need to do some incremental ROA improvement out of securities and banking, but quite frankly it isn\u2019t significant, don\u2019t forget our target overall for the firm is 90 to 110 basis points by 2015. You\u2019ve got securities and banking at 75, quite frankly it doesn\u2019t take -- you don\u2019t need to get securities and banking up into that 90 to 110 basis point range in order for the full firm to produce to 90 basis points.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Yeah, and that was sort of my questionnaire. And now just to follow-on that, I mean, I guess the 75 is being impacted by some litigation expense and some things that probably fall out at some point maybe not 2015, but can you just give a broad sense as to how much it falls out of that sort of 2013 number if you will like what's the sort of non-core operating expenses that\u2019s in there for this year?","John Gerspach","Well I don\u2019t want to tell you that legal and related expenses are non-core.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Sorry, I know what you mean.","John Gerspach","You\u2019re always going to have some level. And we really haven't specified business by business what we would consider to be normal legal and related expenses. So I just prefer not to go into that. There are some repositioning expenses that we have taken in that business that are probably higher this year, but I think you\u2019re talking about $50 million plus in 2013 expenses that you might look at and say that, it's either related to repositioning and that could go away, but we still think that there are ways of improving the overall efficiency of securities and banking of ICG and we still intend to hit those targets in 2015.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Okay, and then just the last question on this area; the assets -- the average assets in the business kind of were at $917 million in Q4 of last year and ended the year at $883 million and is that just a reflection of when and where you see opportunities, you\u2019re kind of thinking it would be somewhere around the $900 million level or is that kind of a thought process on evolution of business mix?","John Gerspach","I think it's probably a combination of a couple of things. One is, I said I think that again our desk I think decided in parts of the later year to de-risk the positions and again they\u2019re free to put those back on as they see fit obviously within our risk parameters. But I also think that one of the things we\u2019ve tried and I think the ROA mentality of the ROA targets has helped because we want to become more efficient in the usage of our balance sheet. So I think we certainly had at least in my opinion some lazy assets that were on the balance sheet that just don\u2019t make sense there. And I would like to in essence re-use that capacity for better earning usage of the balance sheet around client flows, and I think that we\u2019re probably going through a bit of that recycling now.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then just totaling changing gears on you, but the delinquencies in the North American consumer business ticked up in Q4 which I guess surprised me a little bit. And how should we think about that going forward? I mean is the message kind of, look it got as good as it gets and we probably just tick very slowly up from here or is it like a one quarter, don't read too much into it. We could tick back down again next quarter?","John Gerspach","I would say it's somewhere around that. Look it's one quarter, don't read too much into it. But obviously we've had a real good performance when it comes to delinquencies and credit in North America. At some point in time, you're going to get some increase in delinquencies in that book. We don't think that that lends itself to dramatic increases in NCL rates. We gave you some guidance as far as where we see the NCL rate somewhat stabilizing for North America. And so I wouldn't read too much into it, but you're going to get some natural creep. The important thing is that the overall dynamics of the business we're still very focused on maintaining credit discipline there.","Derek De Vries - UBS","Okay, that's helpful, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning. John, just following on the credit side, obviously there has been continued really strong results that have led you to release reserves a little bit above and beyond just four charge-offs. Can you talk about how we can think about the direction of reserve release and do you think it's possible that the overall Citigroup provision could be still down next year over this year?","John Gerspach","Let me separate that into two different answers \u2013 actually three, all right. When you look at the provision, I think we've already seen in our international consumer business that we're not releasing reserves anymore. As a matter of fact as our portfolios build because we've got the loan growth \u2013 the 8% growth in revenues in Latin America, continued growth elsewhere in Asia, besides Korea, you're going to see loan loss reserve build in and we actually had a build of something like $75 million, I think, in the fourth quarter. So the international consumer has already made that turn. When you look at the U.S. consumer, there's probably still some level of reserve release to go through in some of our cards business, but that is drawing to a close and we'll probably see the end of that sometime in 2014. And then the third piece would be in Holdings. What I would say in Holdings is we anticipate being able to offset the U.S. mortgage NCL \u2013 substantially offset the U.S. mortgage NCLs with continued reserve releases. But I don't see reserve releases over and above the NCLs that we have in the business. As a matter of fact the reserve releases will be probably on an ongoing basis be just slightly less than the NCLs that we're seeing in that U.S. mortgage business and Holdings.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And the second question just relates to the top line. If we're in a low single-digit revenue growth environment, it does seem like there is a better trajectory to be able to grow NII in a year-over-year basis. So I just wondered if I can ask you if you can help us separate. Can you get growth in both NII and on the fee side or what do you think will contribute a greater amount to kind of the overall top line performance?","John Gerspach","Well, I do think that you can \u2013 especially if the economy continues to improve and it doesn't have another one of these growth then back off and then growth and then back off and everybody gets concerned again. Even if we can just get the economy moving in a steady direction, I do think that you can get growth in both NII as well as fee. I don't think \u2013 I'm trying in my mind to figure out whether or not you can actually do a percentage where you get 50% of your growth here and 50% there. But I'll just leave it with the fact that you can grow both. And when it looks \u2013 it's something like our transaction services fees business and our cash business in transaction services, we're actually focused on moving more of that business away from an NII business and onto a fee-based business. And that's going to be important for us, because again we're continuing to capture market share in our cash management business and there is just a limit to how much more deposits that we can attract while still trying to keep our overall balance sheet somewhat flat at that $1.9 trillion range or thereabouts. So it's important then as we attract new clients, we grow the volumes with existing clients that we move some of that business into fee-based business as opposed to just being paid for it by \u2013 with increasing levels of deposits.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","And the last thing then for '14 though, you think that even with year-over-year tough comp in mortgage banking and whatever of getting out of trading, that's a reasonable expectation that there is still a good chance that we can see some fee growth?","John Gerspach","Yes, now \u2013 I mean again, I'm thinking about fee growth in transaction services and fee growth in things other than mortgage. Obviously, the mortgage comp in the first half of the year will be a challenge because as I said the mortgage revenues certainly have stabilized. So if you think in terms of \u2013 from a sequential basis, on a sequential basis I do believe that you can see growth in both NII and fees. You're going to be challenged year-on-year with that comparison certainly in the first half of the year.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, got it. Thanks very much, John.","John Gerspach","Okay, not a problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good afternoon. My questions have all been asked and answered. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Erika.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","I've really only got two things given that I think we're in our second movie to get second box of popcorn at this point. But you talked a lot about the legal costs. Can you talk given that you've settled some things that a number of your peers haven't yet, could you talk where these costs are rising from?","Mike Corbat","Certainly when you take a look at Holdings, we've talked about this. Still the single largest piece there would be legacy issues related to private label securitizations and mortgages. And that seems to still \u2013 that certainly is an area that is still out there and there is \u2013 there are a lot of issues surrounding that.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Okay. Just last thing is that you've talked a lot about trying to get Holdings down to breakeven. What about \u2013 I mean if you could structure your transaction with one name that would separate earnings out but would actually create book value, would that be of interest or is that not of interest to Citigroup?","Mike Corbat","Moshe, we look at it in a few ways. One is what's that the value, the residual value or the present value of the earnings of that business and can we get paid for that? Second thing is that if somebody's not willing to pay for that, we've obviously got a good use of that around DTA utilization. And again in that path of getting the essence at one-for-one benefit of Holdings from doing that. We've looked at a number of different structures that could be accomplished there. I think we're open to those but we don't want to find ourselves in a position where we're in essence giving away earnings, being forced to finance it for a period of time and giving away the upside in the oversight of the business. So if we could accomplish the things we want to accomplish, we'd be open to it but we haven't seen that structure yet.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Got it. Just as a comment, not a question, I would just say that selling its discount to tangible book reflects some concern about the book value of that and there is an asset that's clearly undervalued, so thanks very much.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","John Gerspach","Thank you, Moshe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead with your question.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton","Hi. Thanks very much for your patience. Two unrelated questions. One, I assume that some of that increase in regulatory costs is Volcker rule compliant. Do you see any potential exit of businesses or downsizing of businesses as a result of the final Volcker rule?","Mike Corbat","I think that we've taken the actions that we need to take really associated with Volcker. As far as we already seized proprietary trading activities sometime in 2012, I think was the last proprietary trading business that we had. As you've seen in various press stories, we're in the process of winding down our Citi Capital Advisors business which is where we have most of our private equity funds. So we've got both those actions well in hand. As far as your comment or some of those costs related to Volcker, yes, there are some. I mean the Volcker \u2013 there is a data requirement, metrics requirement that one would look at and say it's \u2013 I've heard some people describe it as burdensome. I would never use a word like that, but there certainly is a data requirement that we\u2019re going to have to gear up for and that we are in a process of gearing up for.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton","Thank you. And any sense of timing on when you might achieve breakeven for Citi Holdings?","John Gerspach","I think that, a lot of that again -- as we\u2019ve talked about Citi Holdings, the big drag there is around legal. And as we\u2019ve said unfortunately we can\u2019t control our timing in that. We love to continue to get these legacy legal issues behind this as quickly and as practically and as reasonably as possible.","David Hilder - Drexel Hamilton","Okay. Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got a few other follow ups that I'll work on offline. But bigger picture question I want to ask is in terms of the emerging markets trends, it sounds from your characterization John that you\u2019re a bit more positive about the future trends of economic growth across your emerging markets, countries, that\u2019s in line with GDP expectations that are more positive for \u201914 and \u201915 than they were for the last couple of years, and yet investors continue to be concerned about the growth trajectory in the emerging markets. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to, am I hearing you correctly about Citigroup being more optimistic about the growth trends within the emerging markets and what benefit that might have for potential revenue opportunities within transaction services outside of just short rates going up?","Mike Corbat","Matt, it's Mike. I think that you\u2019ve described our economic outlook correctly that I think we see a better world in terms of 2014 than \u201913. I think the overhang or the challenge to that is, when you go back and you look, so we\u2019re in a tapering phase and ultimately we\u2019ll be in a policy transition phase around interest rates. Those transitions at least in my history have never happened smoothly. I think the world is in a better place today in terms of the probability of that happening at least smoother around floating rate exchange regimes, around bigger foreign currency reserves, around better markets, around better external access that these countries have. And so I think as we look at that I think we probably think from a historic basis this transition is probably smoother, growth looks better, the economies continue to heal. A number of countries from the ways I\u2019ve just described things and in fact you saw this summer really five singled out in terms of concern and again the big concern is the theme around those five with current account deficit. And put away from that I think people felt the transition of the rest of the economies which probably are going to be pretty reasonable. So again, I think we\u2019re cautiously optimistic on it and again think that our businesses are well positioned in that transition to take advantage of that growth both from a fundamental basis as well as hopefully from an interest rate basis as well.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking my question.","Mike Corbat","Not a problem, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much.","John Gerspach","Hi, Eric.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, how are you. I\u2019ll try to keep it tight. At this point you\u2019re somewhat ahead of the curve with respect to your peer group in terms of Basel III compliance and SLR compliance on both a holding company and bank level. So I\u2019m wondering at this point, as you look across the international capital and liquidity regimes, where are your biggest concerns at this stage and what would you consider to be the binding operational constraint for you?","John Gerspach","I think that, Eric as we look something that; and you can imagine with our business model something that we\u2019re focused on is around the concept of a level playing field around harmonization. And what makes it difficult for us is, when you operate multiple jurisdictions, geographies, countries where you\u2019ve just got almost unlimited number of things you\u2019re trying to solve for, and so again I think that as we look at our metrics we think not just in the U.S. but globally we\u2019re at standards that serve us well. But again it's around trying to get some of these things lined up so that there is a level of playing field around the world and that there\u2019s actually a level playing field within those jurisdictions and countries between domestic and international institutions.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And is there any particular piece of proposed regulation or legislation that is concerning to you with respect to your current capital or liquidity position?","John Gerspach","I think the -- we\u2019ve commented on this in the past, it really is -- its not any individualities, it's how all the individual pieces actually fit together. And again to Mike\u2019s comments that he made earlier as far as harmonization, you can take a look at harmonization in one case and say you would like all the different regulatory bodies around the world to sort of view things the same way. But in the same fashion amongst all the different rules, you would like to see some harmonization as well. You would like to see a little bit perhaps a better interaction between the SLR ratio with the standardized approach with advanced approach, with all requirements, there is just -- there is a bunch of these things out there and I think they do get harmonized over time, but until that happens it makes things a bit challenging.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just so then operationally is CCAR your binding constraint or is it something else?","John Gerspach","Well CCAR is certainly a consideration. I mean CCAR becomes a piece of it, but you still -- you run your business based upon risk returns and your ability to monitor risk through some of the other things that I talked about. I wouldn\u2019t say that CCAR is the ultimate, but it becomes the year-end pass\/fail test on a few things.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And just one quick clean-up question. Citi Holdings is 6% of GAAP assets, but what percent of risk weighted assets does it represent at this stage?","John Gerspach","It's about 19% of our risk weighted assets.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","19%, okay.

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat ","Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.2 billion for the third quarter. Excluding CVA and DVA and a tax benefit, net income was $3.3 billion, or $1.02 per share.","Our results reflect a challenging operating environment, including the slowdown in client activity based on uncertainty regarding Fed tapering, concerns about the effect of a U.S. government shutdown, and forecasts for slowing economic growth, particularly in the emerging markets.","Although I think we performed relatively well in this challenging, uneven environment, we cannot, and are not, satisfied with these results, and will be focusing on areas where we need to continue to improve.","Turning to our individual businesses, the macro-environment had the biggest impact in our markets businesses, and in particular fixed income, where the typical slowdown in third quarter activity levels was exacerbated.","We also pared back some of our risks in emerging markets that impacted trading opportunities, but it was the right thing to do for the firm. We have more work to do in equities, where our derivatives performance was not where we want it to be, but year to date we continue to make progress.","As for investment banking, although there was some transactions we would have liked to participate in, we increased our share of wallet so far this year. Our transaction services businesses are still being affected by spread compression, but we continue to work hard to offset that through volume growth and increased market share.","In trade loans, one of the several areas where we leverage our unique global network to a competitive advantage, new originations grew 23% year-to-year.","In consumer banking, as expected, we face significant revenue pressure, as U.S. mortgage originations were sharply reduced, and we continue to adjust to regulatory changes in other markets, such as Korea.","We did see strong revenue and volume growth in other markets, several of which we\u2019ve designated as invest to grow. And importantly, credit trends remain favorable as we focus on our target segments around the world.","Although we can\u2019t control the revenue environment, we certainly can control our expenses, and expenses for the quarter were $11.7 billion, 4% below the second quarter and the prior year period. We achieved this while making investments and bearing the brunt of increased regulatory costs. We remain on track with the repositioning actions we announced late last year, which have helped reduce our headcount by over 10,000 people year-to-year.","We\u2019re working on a variety of different efforts to improve our productivity. Some center on optimizing our global real estate footprint, and have resulted in reducing our portfolio of sites by 73. Others seek to reduce the turnaround time for transactions and improve the client experience. More importantly, we\u2019re instilling the need for these efforts to be business as usual and not episodic.","We also continue to make progress in two critical areas which I\u2019ve identified for you before, reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and the utilization of our deferred tax assets. We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings by $9 billion during the quarter.","Holdings assets now total $122 billion and are 6% of our GAAP balance sheet, and even without the benefit of an incremental loan loss reserve release, Holdings net loss was reduced for the third consecutive quarter.","While legal costs associated with Citi Holdings will likely remain elevated in the near term, we took another significant step to get past legacy issues with our agreement with Freddie Mac, that following on to our agreement with Fannie Mae during the second quarter.","Regarding our deferred tax assets, we consumed $500 million of DTA during the third quarter. This modest amount brings the 2013 total year to date to $1.8 billion.","As you know, I want Citi to be known as an indisputably strong and stable institution, and again we made progress towards this goal. The capital we generated this quarter, primarily through retained earnings and DTA utilization, resulted in our tier one common ratio increasing to an estimated 10.4% on a Basel III basis.","Other key metrics also strengthened, including our supplementary leverage ratio, which increased to an estimated 5.1%.","Looking towards the end of the year, we believe it\u2019s going to remain a challenging environment, and growth uneven. As has been the case historically, transitioning from a lower to higher rate environment doesn\u2019t happen without causing disruptions, especially in the emerging markets, and we\u2019re clearly seeing evidence of that.","In addition, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the Fed tapering is keeping many investors on the sidelines, and that may be for an extended period of time.","In the U.S., the twin impact from the government shutdown and dangerous flirtation with the debt ceiling are clearly impacting the economy and the financial markets. The housing market is still in recovery mode, but we expect refinancing volumes to continue to decrease. We\u2019ll continue to take steps to make sure our mortgage and other consumer businesses are sized correctly.","Internationally, emerging growth has slowed and will likely remain uneven, but we still believe these markets will outpace developed market growth. That being said, we manage our risk prudently and continue to adjust our appetite based on the latest trends and conditions.","John will go through the deck, and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach ","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were negative $336 million pretax and $208 million after tax in the third quarter, for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07. We also recorded a tax benefit of $176 million related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, which had a positive impact on EPS of $0.06 per share.","For comparison purposes, in the third quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were negative $776 million pretax, or $485 million after tax, for a negative impact of $0.16 per share. We also had a tax benefit last year of $582 million, or $0.19 per share.","In addition, in the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a pretax loss of $4.7 billion related to to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.94 per share in that quarter. Adjusting for these items, we earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2013, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $1.06 per share on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2012.","Throughout today\u2019s earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results, excluding CVA\/DVA, the tax benefits, and gains or losses on the sale of minority investments, to provide comparability to prior periods.","On slide four, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. We earned $3.3 billion in the third quarter, roughly flat to last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were offset by a decline in revenues and a higher tax rate.","Earnings per share declined 4%, including the impact of higher preferred dividends in the recent quarter.","Citigroup end of period loans were flat year over year at $658 billion, as growth in Citicorp was offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits grew to $955 billion.","On slide five, we provide more detail on revenues in constant dollars, which declined 4% from last year and 8% sequentially. As Mike discussed, we faced a challenging operating environment across many of our businesses in the third quarter.","In consumer banking, revenues declined sequentially by roughly $350 million, primarily driven by lower U.S. mortgage refinancing activity, as well as the absence of a $180 million gain in the second quarter.","Securities and banking revenues declined by nearly $1.3 billion sequentially, as a seasonal decline in activity in the third quarter was exacerbated by uncertainty around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown, and other geopolitical events. We also incurred losses on loan hedges, as compared to gains in the prior quarter, as spreads tightened versus the end of the second quarter.","In transaction services, revenues declined sequentially from a seasonally strong second quarter, which also included a $50 million gain. Year over year, revenues increased as growth in volumes and fees more than offset the impact of spread compression.","Holdings revenues were up versus prior periods, mostly driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills this quarter. Finally, foreign currency translation accounted for roughly $200 million of the reported revenue decline versus prior periods.","As we show on slide six, we maintained our focus on expense discipline in the third quarter. Excluding legal and repositioning costs, core operating expenses were roughly $10.8 billion, down over $400 million year over year, and over $250 million sequentially in constant dollars.","At the end of the second quarter, I said we expected to see about $200 million of incremental repositioning savings by the end of the 2013. We achieved about half of that amount in the third quarter, or roughly $100 million. The incremental $150 million of expense savings this quarter was comprised of lower performance-based compensation and lower transaction costs, both of which were driven by the more challenging revenue environment in the third quarter.","Legal costs remained elevated at nearly $700 million, mostly reported in Citi Holdings, and repositioning costs totaled $133 million for the third quarter, mostly in Citicorp. Year to date, repositioning costs have averaged around $125 million per quarter. Naturally, there will be some variability quarter to quarter in these costs as we continue to pursue our efficiency efforts, but we do not anticipate taking another very large repositioning charge similar to the fourth quarter of last year.","On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated third quarter revenues of $17 billion, and net income of $3.4 billion. Year over year, revenues declined 7% and expenses were down 6%, driven by repositioning savings, lower performance-based compensation, lower legal and related expenses, and the impact of FX.","Credit costs in Citicorp increased year over year. Net credit losses continued to improve. However, reserve releases in North America cards continued to decline and were partially offset by reserve builds in Latin America consumer. We also built reserves in our unfunded corporate portfolio, driven by an increase in commitments, as well as certain credits migrating to lower risk ratings in the quarter.","Year to date, Citicorp revenues grew 1% and expenses declined 3%, partially offset by the higher cost of credit, resulting in 5% growth in pretax earnings.","Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were nearly $1.3 billion and the net loss declined to roughly $100 million in the third quarter. Citi Holdings ended the period with $122 billion of assets, or 6% of total Citigroup assets.","Turning to Citicorp, on slide eight, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. On this basis, revenues grew 2% year over year while expenses declined 1%. In Latin America, revenues grew 6% and expenses were up 4% from last year, while in Asia revenues declined 2% and expenses were down 4%. Revenues were down in EMEA, reflecting market exits in Turkey and Romania.","International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets, including Korea. However, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the third quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from last year, and card purchase sales were up 8%.","Credit costs of $836 million in the third quarter were up 34% from last year. Net credit losses increased in dollar terms, but remained relatively stable as a percentage of loans.","We also built loan loss reserves including nearly $170 million in Latin America, roughly half of which was related to our exposure to the top three home builders in Mexico, with the remainder driven by continued portfolio growth as well as potential losses from recent hurricanes in that region.","I mentioned last quarter that we continue to monitor the performance of our clients in the home building industry in Mexico, as well as the value of our collateral. At the end of the third quarter, our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled less than $300 million.","The loan loss reserve build in the recent quarter was driven by further deterioration in the financial and operating condition of these companies and decreases in the value of our collateral, resulting from the breach of certain of these clients\u2019 credit agreements with us as well as lower valuations.","We will continue to monitor the performance of our home builder clients as well as the value of our collateral to determine whether additional reserves or chargeoffs may be required in future periods.","On slide nine, we show revenue details for Asia consumers. Lower revenues in the third quarter reflected spread compression in retail banking as well as the continued impact of regulatory changes in certain markets, most significantly in Korea.","Sequentially, the decline was also driven by lower investment sales revenues, which tend to fluctuate more in line with retail investor sentiment and the broader capital markets environment.","Card revenues improved both year over year and sequentially with continued growth in purchase sales across the region. And, we saw strong revenue growth in certain markets, including Hong Kong, India, Thailand, and China.","Turning to Korea, we are in an ongoing process to reposition our consumer franchise in that market to improve its operating efficiency and returns. And, upon completion, Korea should better reflect our consumer franchise elsewhere around the world, with a footprint more concentrated in the major cities and a focus on high quality consumer segments.","We believe revenues in Korea could begin to stabilize in early 2014, but we expect this market to continue to present a drag on year over year revenue comparisons for Asia through at least next year.","Slide 10 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 12% year over year, and 6% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 35% from last year and 29% sequentially, reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues as well as continued spread compression on deposits, partially offset by growth in deposits and commercial loans. Also, as we mentioned last quarter, our mortgage revenues in the second quarter included a gain of roughly $180 million on the sale of an on balance sheet mortgage portfolio.","Cards revenues of $3.6 billion were roughly flat versus last year, as an improvement in net interest spreads was offset by lower average loan balances. On a sequential basis, revenues grew 4% as average loan balances stabilized in Citi-branded cards and net interest spreads continued to improve.","In retail services, spreads were lower, driven by a higher mix of deferred interest promotional balances, but loan balances grew due to the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.","Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 4% year over year, primarily reflecting lower legal and related costs and repositioning savings. Third quarter results reflected a portion of the benefit we expect from actions we have taken to reduce the expense base in mortgages in light of the lower origination activities. However, we also saw higher expenses in cards as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","The net reduction in expenses quarter over quarter was mostly driven by continued repositioning actions, as well as reduced marketing expenses. Credit costs increased year over year as net credit losses continued to improve, but the loan loss reserve release also declined to just over $200 million, driven by cards.","Overall, while we face significant mortgage and spread-related headwinds in North America this quarter that are likely to continue, we also saw some progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continued to grow, up 8% year over year, including 15% growth in checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 15%, and card purchase sales grew year over year in both portfolios.","Slide 11 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve in the third quarter, with a decline in the NCL rate reflecting both underlying improvement in the portfolio as well as the impact of purchase accounting for the Best Buy portfolio acquisition.","In Asia and EMEA, we also saw stable to improving credit trends. And, in Latin America, the net credit loss rate has remained fairly flat for the past several quarters. We expect the fourth quarter NCL rate in Latin America to remain roughly flat to third quarter levels.","However, as we\u2019ve stated previously, the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to home builders in Mexico. In addition, as I mentioned, we took reserves this quarter for estimated potential losses resulting from the two recent hurricanes in Mexico. Any such losses may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarters. However, we would expect these losses to be charged against the reserve and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit.","Slide 12 shows our securities and banking business. Revenues of $5.1 billion declined 10% from last year and 20% from the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $839 million were down 10% from the prior year and 19% from last quarter, mostly in line with the overall market. While revenues declined in the third quarter, our franchise continued to show momentum year to date, with revenues up 10% year over year and wallet share gains in most major products.","Equity market revenues of $710 million were up 36% from last year, reflecting market share gains as well as improvement in our derivatives trading performance.","Sequentially, equity market revenues declined 25% as cash equity revenues declined broadly in line with overall market volumes and trading performance was weaker in derivatives. While our derivatives results were lower this quarter, we continue to make progress in building this franchise, which contributed to the 24% growth in equities revenues year to date.","Fixed income market revenues of $2.8 billion declined 26% from a particularly strong third quarter last year, when we benefited from an environment with strong liquidity, more robust client activity, and significant credit spread tightening. By contrast, the recent quarter reflected a general slowdown in client activity, exacerbated by uncertainty around the timing of Fed tapering, the pending government shutdown, and other geopolitical events.","Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 17%, reflecting the slowdown in activity, as well as actions to pare back risk given volatility in the emerging markets. Private bank revenues of $614 million were up slightly from last year, and down 5% sequentially, driven by lower capital markets activity.","Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $377 million in the third quarter, down 10% from last year on lower volumes and down 16% sequentially on lower spreads as well as losses on loan sale activity.","Total operating expenses of $3.4 billion were down both year over year and sequentially, reflecting the impact of headcount reductions and lower performance-based compensation.","For the first nine months of 2013, total revenues increased 6% over last year, driven by equities and investment banking, while expenses declined 3%, resulting in 13% net income growth.","Moving to transaction services on slide 13, revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% from last year in constant dollars, as strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues.","Treasury and trade solutions was up 1% as volume and fee growth was partially offset by the impact of spread compression globally, and securities and fund services revenues grew 3% as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset lower spreads.","Sequentially, revenues declined 4%, reflecting seasonally strong client activity and a one-time gain of roughly $50 million in the prior quarter.","Spread compression continued to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume drivers for transaction services showed sustained momentum. Trade loan originations grew 23% year over year. Average deposits were up 4%. Assets under custody grew by 9%, and [SFS] settlement volumes grew 11%.","Expenses of $1.4 billion grew 4% year over year in constant dollars, driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency savings. While expense growth outpaced revenue growth in the third quarter, we continue to believe the business can achieve positive operating leverage in total for the second half of 2013, even when excluding the repositioning costs incurred in the fourth quarter of last year.","Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were up versus the prior year, driven by hedging activities, partially offset by lower AFS sales, while expenses declined, mostly reflecting lower legal and related costs.","Assets of $313 billion included approximately $119 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $139 of liquid available for sale securities.","Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $122 billion in Citi Holdings, or 6% of total Citigroup assets. The $9 billion reduction in the third quarter reflected $4 billion of asset sales and $5 billion of net paydowns.","On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.3 billion were up year over year and sequentially, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds this quarter.","Citi Holdings expenses increased 16% year over year to $1.4 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs. Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 16% to roughly $790 million.","Net credit losses continued to improve in the third quarter, driven by North America mortgages. And we released $679 million of loan loss reserves, including a release of roughly $725 million in North America mortgages, partially offset by losses on asset sales.","Regarding the mortgage reserve release, roughly $425 million of reserves were utilized to offset net credit losses in the third quarter, and the incremental $300 million reserve release was driven by continued improvement in delinquencies and home prices year to date.","Looking to the fourth quarter, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable, we expect to utilize loan loss reserves to offset virtually all of our mortgage net credit losses, but we do not currently anticipate additional reserve releases beyond that level. We ended the period with $5.7 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings or 40 months of NCL coverage.","Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 17, the pretax loss in Citi Holdings improved again this quarter, even excluding the incremental $300 million reserve release in mortgages. However, while the adjusted operating margin on the upper left panel on this slide increased significantly in the past two quarters to roughly $500 million, it will likely trend lower as each of the last two quarters included some level of positive marks or episodic gains.","We expect mortgage net credit losses to continue to improve with reserve releases trending in line with NCLs. And legal costs will likely continue to be elevated and somewhat volatile in the near term.","On slide 18, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends. We ended the quarter with $76 billion of North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, down 20% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined 50% and the loss rate improved by over 130 basis points.","These mortgages include approximately $12 billion of loans originated in our legacy Citi Financial business, the vast majority of which are residential first mortgages. While the NCL rates on Citi Financial loans have improved, the loss rates on these loans tend to be higher at just over 5% in the third quarter, as compared to less than 1% for residential first mortgages originated by Citi Mortgage. We sold roughly $500 million of mortgages this quarter, most of which were nonperforming, for a total of $6.4 of mortgage sales year to date.","On slide 19, we show delinquency trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans. 30-plus day delinquencies continue to improve, down 9% sequentially, to $5 billion. FICO and LTV trends also remain favorable through the third quarter, and we provide these details in the appendix on slide 38.","On slide 20, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenues totaled $11.5 billion in the third quarter. In constant dollars, net interest revenue was roughly flat to the prior quarter and down slightly versus last year.","Our net interest margin in the third quarter decreased by 4 basis points, reflecting lower loan yields and an increase in cash balances, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain roughly flat.","On slide 21, we show our key capital metrics through the third quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated tier one common ratio increased to 10.4%, driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Citigroup\u2019s estimated supplementary leverage ratio was 5.1%, up from 4.9% last quarter, and the supplementary leverage ratio for Citibank remained above 6% for the third quarter.","In summary, we clearly faced a challenging environment in the third quarter, with a slowdown in client activity, a continued low rate environment, and declining mortgage originations all posing significant headwinds.","But against this backdrop, we managed our business well, with a continued focus on efficiency and growing our loan portfolio in a disciplined manner. We are on track to meet the repositioning targets we announced at the end of last year, and underlying credit performance remained favorable.","We also continue to make significant progress in winding down Citi Holdings, which is now just 6% of total Citigroup assets. Year to date, the quarterly drag from Citi Holdings is down significantly from last year, even excluding the incremental mortgage reserve release this quarter.","And, finally, we continue to grow our capital, benefitting from a combination of earnings and further DTA utilization. We ended the quarter with an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.4%, and an estimated supplementary leverage ratio of 5.1%, one of the strongest capital positions in our industry.","Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer we expect continued headwinds in mortgages, although some of this pressure should be offset by additional revenues from the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.","Net credit loss trends in North America should remain favorable, although we expect net loan loss reserve releases to moderate given the need to build reserves for new loans originated in the Best Buy portfolio.","In international consumer, in total we expect continued volume growth, albeit somewhat offset by ongoing spread compression globally. Growth will likely be driven by Latin America, as we expect our repositioning efforts in Korea to continue to present a drag on year over year revenue comparisons in Asia in the near term. And, international consumer credit costs should generally trend in line with loan growth.","Turning to our institutional businesses, our securities and banking results will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share over time with our target clients.","And, in transaction services, we expect continued volume and fee growth to help offset the ongoing pressure of the low rate environment. So, in total we see a continued challenging operating environment in the near term, but we remain focused on those aspects of our business that we can control.","Our results year to date reflect the strength of our franchise and our progress towards our key priorities: gaining share with our clients, generating consistent earnings, and building our capital base.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","I was wondering how you\u2019re feeling about some of the 2015 financial targets. If we look at the ROA target of 90 to 110 basis points in 2015, we look at this quarter at [59] basis points year to date, around 80, what do you see as the key driver to getting toward the 2015 goal?","John Gerspach ","As we\u2019ve talked about, reducing the losses in Citi Holdings is certainly one of the key goals that we see driving us toward the goal of generating ROA of between 90 and 110 basis points in 2015. And we\u2019d also look for some modest amount of net income improvement coming out of Citicorp as well.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","On the Citicorp side, I guess the efficiency goal is part of those 2015 targets around mid-50s, I'd just call it 55. You had 61 this quarter on the efficiency ratio, and 57 year to date. So I guess that implies some additional savings to be realized or revenue growth? Can you talk about getting to those efficiency goals?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, as we said when Mike laid out those efficiency goals back in March, the environment that we anticipated was low single digit growth in revenues, and I think that\u2019s pretty much the environment that we\u2019ve seen, and certainly might expect to see in the near term.","So we do anticipate most of the contribution towards those efficiency targets to come out of the expense line. And, I think as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve been delivering on the repositioning savings that we talked about after that fourth quarter reserve that we took last year, and we continue to try to find additional efficiency savings throughout the businesses.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","And just on that, you mentioned the incremental efficiency saves this quarter. Can you just remind us, if you tally up what you were shooting for with last year\u2019s, I think it was 900 this year, where are you on that cumulatively?","John Gerspach ","As we said at the end of the second quarter, I walked everybody through where we were, and we said our estimate that was that you\u2019d see $300 million of the savings in the run rate in the fourth quarter. The $300 million, therefore, representing exactly what we had said we would get, which is a total annual save of $1.2 billion. And we had about $200 million of additional run rate savings to generate from the end of the second quarter. And as I mentioned, we generated about half of that, say $100 million, in the third quarter. So we\u2019ve got about $100 million more to bake into our fourth quarter results.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","So we should look for that to kind of come off the 10.8 adjusted expense number, assuming a similar revenue environment?","John Gerspach ","If volumes and the environment stays the same, you\u2019ll see the repositioning savings come through maybe partially offset by some incremental seasonal marketing expenses. So I don\u2019t want you to just take the 10.843 and take an even $100 off and get 10.743. The roundings could end up leaving us rounding at 10.8. But you should see the expenses come down, again, assuming the environment stays where it is.","John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein ","Understood. But thinking about next year, as we go from 2014 to 2015, it seems that if revenues aren\u2019t going to get better, you would need to do more than 10.7, 10.8, or beyond the re-positioning saves you\u2019ve announced for this year to get that efficiency ratio towards the 2015 target. So it seems reasonable to expect more saves, whether you announce them or not, in 2014?","John Gerspach ","Well, as I said, we\u2019re going to be committed to delivering the efficiency targets as we laid out for 2015. And as you noted, year to date we\u2019ve already got an efficiency ratio of 57% in Citicorp. So I think that we\u2019ve already made a fair bit of progress this year in going from where we ended up in 2012. So I think we\u2019ll continue to make progress toward the 2015 goal in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","A two-parter, quickly, on reserves. One, I just want to make sure the reserve build that you spoke about, especially on the international side, is a function of growth and not some concerns on credit?","John Gerspach","The two particular areas of \u201ccredit concerns\u201d that we had in the quarter were the home builder loans that I mentioned and the impact of those two hurricanes that hit Mexico during the month of September. So when you think about the $170 million reserve build that I mentioned for Latin America, three quarters, maybe a little bit more of that build, were really associated with those two items. And the rest is portfolio growth.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","And then you also said inside holdings, I think, this quarter, you had the 725. You broke down the portion related to losses, and the portion related to just overage, and led us to not more than just losses in the fourth quarter. Just curious, you follow that up with 40 months of coverage. What\u2019s holding back a little bit more? Because the trends on credit seem great.","John Gerspach ","Yeah, the trends on credit are great, and like anything else, we\u2019d like to see where the environment is going into the fourth quarter. There still is a bit of an unsettled environment out there as you may know, and you may see yourself.","But in general, when you look at 40 months of coverage - and I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re always going to stay at 40 months of coverage - it won\u2019t be unusual, or shouldn\u2019t be unusual, for us to have a fairly high month\u2019s coverage ratio on NCLs when you think about the fact that TDR - troubled debt restructurings - represent just under 20% or so of our first mortgage portfolio on holdings.","And as you think about it, the LLR that you need to hold for a TDR is, for all intents and purposes, a discounted value of a life of loan reserve. So, as such, I just think you should expect that our LLR is going to continue to represent fairly significant months of NCL coverage for some time.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","The mortgage revenue runoff will happen quickly, as we\u2019ve seen, and typically there\u2019s an expense lag of a quarter or two. Is there anything material you can point to that over the next couple of quarters, as you adjust on that lag, that even in a no-change world, you\u2019ll get some efficiencies just from running through the normal process?","Mike Corbat ","You\u2019re referring in this instance to the mortgage business in corp, not the holdings run?","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Correct.","Mike Corbat ","So what we\u2019ve spoke to is we\u2019ve clearly, as a company, clearly as an industry, seen the slowdown coming out of the changes [stance] in May for the Fed. And we started very quickly in anticipating that to take actions in the second quarter. We\u2019ve taken more actions in the third quarter. You\u2019ve probably read in the press some of those actions we\u2019ve taken. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lag to that, because in the area of fulfillment, we\u2019ve got commitments that we need to process and get through the pipes. But we\u2019re focused on it, and clearly making sure that our mortgage business fits what we see as the future capacity, future necessity and demand of that sector.","Glenn Schorr - ISI ","Last one is, just in [FIC], I understand the choppiness, and you referred to it a couple of times, on the macro stuff, that delayed the quarter or impacted the quarter. Just curious if it was particularly acute within emerging market FX or within credit, just so we can adjust for ourselves. Because we\u2019re well below something like a 12-quarter average number.","John Gerspach ","And when you think about the impact on the [FIC] revenues, it certainly had the largest product that was impacted quarter on quarter and year over year, was certainly our rates and currencies business. And you wouldn\u2019t be wrong in thinking about the fact that there was a fair degree of that impact that was concentrated in the emerging markets.","And that\u2019s really due to the fact that in the third quarter, even towards the end of June, we saw a high amount of volatility in certain emerging markets. And in some cases we saw spreads widening between 50 and 250 basis points. So as a result, we pared back our risk in many of those markets, while still providing liquidity to our customers during this period of turmoil.","So I\u2019d say that the combination of the high volatility and our intentionally running a lower risk in many of the markets made for a more difficult environment for us to capture trading opportunities.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","On the $300 million of Mexican loans that you identified, what types of loans to builders? Are they more land loans, or are they working capital loans? What type of loans are they?","John Gerspach ","They\u2019re development loans. They\u2019re, you know, building loans as far as people are building. They have the land, and they\u2019re looking for construction type of loans.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And in terms of your transaction business, you talked about the challenges that you\u2019re having with the spreads, and it\u2019s been like this for some time, because of the low rate environment. Can you share with us what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for that business to start seeing wider spreads?","John Gerspach ","Rising rates, but particularly rising rates in the current to five-year area. So far, to the extent we\u2019ve had any sort of rising rate environment, it\u2019s been more out towards the 10-year and higher. And we really need the shorter tenures to begin to rise to really benefit that business.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Would you benefit more for the rates here in the U.S. or in the E.U., or is it 50-50? Which rates may work better, once they start rising?","John Gerspach ","U.S. rates would definitely have a faster and certainly more impactful hit on us.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","You, like your peers, I presume, have made comments to the Federal Reserve about the SLR that they\u2019ve proposed. What\u2019s you folks\u2019 view on the possibility of them easing up, or giving you guys some relief in the way they\u2019re defining the assets that you\u2019re going to use, and the denominator for that equation, such as cash at central banks? Do you think they might pull that out of the equation? Or are they really focused on just keeping it the way it is?","John Gerspach ","That\u2019s a little difficult to answer. The comment period only ended a brief time ago, and so there\u2019s a lot to see how the Fed and others take a look at the various comment letters that were submitted. And I\u2019d say that, as I normally do, we continue to have constructive dialogues with our regulators, and so we\u2019ll have to see how they react.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Coming back to Citi Holdings and talking about the loan loss reserve releasing, if we were to see housing prices appreciate in 2014 in the mid to high single-digits, down from where we\u2019ve seen low double-digits, would that give you more confidence to release more reserves?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t want you to think that the amount of loan loss reserves that we think we need to hold is solely linked to home price movements. It\u2019s that, it\u2019s also a bit of the overall economy. So there\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s what\u2019s going on with delinquencies. And, as I mentioned to one of the prior callers, it also has to do with the amount of TDRs that we have in the portfolio, where you\u2019re really then dealing with, like I said, almost a discounted life of loan reserve. And that\u2019s not necessarily going to get influenced tremendously by movements in HPI.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","And then finally, John, on slide 31 you guys give us good detail on the consumer credit delinquency trends, and obviously they\u2019re going in the proper direction for the total portfolio. Are there any of those subsectors, whether it\u2019s Mexico or Korea, that concern you the most, or what we should kind of keep an eye on? Because the total numbers are good, but some of the subsectors are going the opposite direction.","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say that the ones that you would think about are the ones that we\u2019re focused on as well, which is, as I mentioned, Mexico. Not that we\u2019ve got a tremendous worry in Mexico, but we called out a couple of things with the home builders. And we\u2019ll have to assess the impact of the recent storms. Mexico is also going through a period where they\u2019re still absorbing the change in administration and a lot of the reform work that is going on with the new administration, so we think that long term that\u2019s beneficial, but it\u2019s certainly had a slowdown in growth in the near term in Mexico. But Mexico, Korea, those are certainly the countries where we\u2019ve got the two largest portfolios, and so those are certainly two good ones to watch.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Just a quick question. You\u2019re down to 6% of assets out of Citi Holdings, but the RWAs are still at 20%. Is that all a function of the mortgage side? Or are there some idiosyncratic or large RWA assets in, say, SAP that we could see some more progress on the RWAs on the Basel III side?","John Gerspach ","It\u2019s a combination of both things. There are, as you put it, some idiosyncratic, but they\u2019re somewhat small as well. The largest impact we\u2019re going to have on driving down RWA, over time, will still be resident with the mortgages. But, you know, there are a few things that are in SAP, such as we\u2019ve got a lot of the hold to maturity securities, and that\u2019s going to certainly impact us. And the other one that sort of exists below the surface is op risk. Don\u2019t forget, op risk also, when you get into a Basel III environment, there\u2019s a decent chunk of your RWA that is constituted by op risk. And that is a much longer term part of your capital base to try to get rid of. So it\u2019s largely mortgages. There\u2019s a couple of things in SAP that could give us a pop, but op risk is also going to take some time to work our way out of.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Should we expect any pop from the sale of some of the hedge fund and private equity assets that looks like will close in the fourth quarter?","John Gerspach ","Not really.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And maybe another question on the SLR. It seems like there\u2019s been more effort to use compression trades and it\u2019s unclear on the benefits of OTC clearing, but I would assume that would also be positive on notional value. Have you got any sense whether you think that\u2019s a big item, a small item? And obviously you can\u2019t give any numbers, but do you think that could have some positive impact on SLR going forward?","John Gerspach ","I clearly think it could have a positive impact on the SLR going forward. I think the magnitude of the impact is something that we\u2019ll have to see over time, just to see just how much of that we can actually accomplish.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","And last question, just on CCAR. You guys, obviously with one of the strongest Basel III ratios, the new stress test will partially use Basel III, and your SLR is above 5% already, do you guys feel a lot better, still cautious? How do we think about your approach to CCAR at the end of this year?","Mike Corbat ","Well, I think versus a year ago, I\u2019d say we certainly feel better, and we feel better by a few things. We laid out that we wanted to get the right result in terms of last year\u2019s submission. I think we got that, and I think, importantly, it just wasn\u2019t the quantitative piece, it was the qualitative piece.","And since then, I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to generate capital in a meaningful way when we kind of get the right things working. The combination of corporate earnings, reducing the drag in holdings, the utilization, the DTA, and I think we\u2019ve started to build a track record of that.","But I think we\u2019ve got more work to do. We continue to be in a challenging operating environment, and as John and I have described, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change. And at this point, we really don\u2019t know the scenarios and what they\u2019re going to be, so we\u2019ll take those on board, we\u2019ll see how the fourth quarter shapes up, and then we\u2019ll start to make some decisions in terms of what our submission might look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","First question is on one of the items that you think broadly you can control, which is your expense structure. Obviously securities and banking saw a pretty significant decline in revenue and we know that expenses can be sticky, but it seemed as if they were very sticky when you look at the efficiency ratio there, even ex the DVA issues. And I was wondering is there some high level of litigation reserve build maybe that\u2019s encompassed within the expenses there this quarter?","John Gerspach ","There\u2019s a minor amount of litigation expenses, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that would be driving the expense [due] in securities and banking. Otherwise we would have called it out for you.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","I think you might have mentioned in a [unintelligible] or earlier today that you saw private label securities as still an open issue, and I wasn\u2019t sure what you exactly meant to say with that. But maybe you can give us a sense for whether we should be expecting more litigation reserve build as a result of that?","John Gerspach ","I think the question was more in terms of what issues remain open from a litigation point of view relating to mortgages. And it was more on dealing with holdings and the litigation expenses that we had in holdings, and the fact that with the agreements now that we had reached with Fannie and Freddie, we had pretty much put the repurchase risk with those two - the GSEs - behind us. And my comment was that the largest remaining area of mortgage litigation that I think the industry still faced had to do with private label securitizations.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And if you were building reserves for the private label litigations that did affect you for underwriting and originations that you had done prior to 2009, would that reserve build be in holdings?","John Gerspach ","Yes, it would.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And the final question, since we\u2019re talking about holdings expense levels, is as you called out, ex all that stuff, your expense levels in holdings were down about 16% year over year, which is obviously the trend that we all want to see. But I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more guidance over the next one to two years how should we see the expense that\u2019s in place for managing all those Citi Holdings assets come down as the assets do.","Mike Corbat ","It\u2019s tough to predict what asset sales will look like. Clearly we\u2019ve been in a transitioning rate environment, and John had talked about our desire to sell reperforming mortgages and also not only shed the asset but take the expense out. So I think in this environment it\u2019s tough to know and have a crystal ball looking forward in terms of what sales will look like, and therefore I think it\u2019s difficult to judge what expense reductions will look like. But as we\u2019ve been, we\u2019re going to continue to be focused on trying to manage those expenses down. And again, as we look at asset sales, it\u2019s not just about the asset sale, the capital release, the risk reduction, it\u2019s also about the expense reduction. We look at those things in aggregate, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that and take advantage of those things that are out there. But really tough to predict.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research ","And then maybe just a follow up on that. Maybe you can give us an update on how you\u2019re managing One Main?","Mike Corbat ","One Main is a business that we put through a pretty sizable restructuring. Probably today one of a few, if not only, of scale branch base subprime consumer lending businesses. Not a business, as we\u2019ve said, that fits long term with us. But again, I think things that have gone on from a regulatory and credit dynamic, there\u2019s a real part of society that needs to be served. We think One Main is very well-positioned to do that. And at the point in time where somebody comes along and is willing to pay us a price that we think the business is worth, then we\u2019ll be happy to consider that. But until that, we\u2019re going to continue to run the business and have it best positioned for that day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","Just a follow up on the difference between RWAs and assets in holdings. You mentioned that a big portion of the difference is operating risk. And most of holdings looks like a mortgage company now, and I\u2019m wondering to what extent is there still an operating mortgage company there? I thought of it mainly as just basically holdings of loans and assets as opposed to an operating company.","John Gerspach ","Well, you do have to service those assets.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","So it\u2019s purely a servicing, it\u2019s not an origination\u2026","John Gerspach ","Correct. And you may think about the fact that certainly in the last couple of years a lot of the expense that has been incurred by people in the industry, including elevated NCL rates, including some of the additional expense dollars that people have had to put in it, have been associated with what has been determined to be operating deficiencies for these mortgages. So there is still a certain amount of op risk that we need to account for in our Basel III risk weighted asset determination.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","But should we expect over time that the RWAs will track down roughly in line with the asset decline? Because we didn\u2019t see that this quarter.","John Gerspach ","Well, let\u2019s see. On holdings, the GAAP assets came down $9 billion and the risk-weighted assets and holdings came down about 13. So it\u2019s more or less in line. Again, it has to do with mix and everything else. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be able to just look always and say it\u2019s exactly in a ratio of X to X. Plus, as I mentioned, that op risk does not come down ratably based upon the sale of assets. To the extent I\u2019m servicing a loan, I still have op risk.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company ","And then another question just on the Best Buy acquisition. Should we expect that to have roughly the same profitability of your other partner cards? Or theoretically should it be disproportionately better impact? And I would assume there\u2019s some that you\u2019d get efficiencies on the expense side in managing that in your existing business.","John Gerspach ","I would say that over time you should expect it to contribute to increased profitability in retail services, but in the near term it\u2019s likely to actually be a drag on profitability growth, only because of the mechanics that are involved in calculating now the loan loss reserves that we need to put on Best Buy.","You know, under purchase accounting the acquired portfolios now we bring them on our books at fair market value, which means they come on without any loan loss reserve. Therefore, as you build each new loan, as each new incremental loan comes on your books, you need to start putting up loan loss reserves for the estimated inherent losses in those loans. And there\u2019s no benefit from old loans rolling off your books, so you don\u2019t see any reduction in LLR because you\u2019ve got old loans rolling off.","So the first 12 months, maybe the first 15 months, of the acquisition, you\u2019re going to see an accelerated build of LLR, just resulting from the mechanics, before everything smooths itself out.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","And the tax books work the same way?","John Gerspach ","Well, the tax books, the tax return, won\u2019t reflect. But I think what you\u2019re interested in is the DTA aspect.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","Correct. Do acquisitions help the DTA?","John Gerspach ","They do over the longer term, but I take tax benefit for the LLR just as I do with any other business. So, again, the first year or so, it will be less beneficial than you might otherwise think.","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer ","And then finally, just to ask Guy\u2019s question a different way, in securities and banking we saw revenues go from $6.4 billion to $5.1 billion, so down $1.3 billion, but expenses only came down $100 million. And should one just not look at it on a linked-quarter basis? I mean, it just didn\u2019t seem like they came down in line with revenues.","John Gerspach ","I actually agree with your comment. I think that quarter on quarter expense variations in that business can be a bit misleading. I personally believe that to really get a true picture of how a firm is managing its expense base, you need to look at its performance over a full year. And I think if you do the analysis, and if you look at the expenses in that business\u2026","Just take out our fourth quarter \u201912 repositioning reserve, and look at those expenses on a trailing 12 month basis, for a run of quarters, what you\u2019re going to see is that expenses, both in the ICG and securities and banking have been steadily declining since the first quarter of last year. So on a trailing 12 months basis, the efficiency ratios in both ICG and securities and banking have also been steadily improving during that same timeframe.","And I think that if you take a look at that and you compare our efficiency ratios on a trailing 12 month basis over that timeframe with our peer institutions, using the ICG ratios for the universal banking peers and the security and banking ratios for our more pure play investment banking peers, I think you\u2019re going to find that we hold up pretty well and almost every quarter our trailing 12 month expense efficiency is better than each of our peers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","I wanted to follow up on that last question, and it\u2019s been asked several times. So if we were to accept that your trailing 12 month expense efficiency looks good, but still I think the issue is the quarter on quarter decline. You said it could be misleading in the bigger picture of things. But at the same time, what we\u2019ve heard is macro still has headwinds, markets are still unsettled, it\u2019s a challenging operating environment, and you only have $100 million of savings left. So I think the concern is, is this potentially an inflection point for what\u2019s been a decent trailing 12 month record, but now we\u2019re going into an area that\u2019s maybe not going to get us positive operating leverage?","Mike Corbat ","When we laid out our public targets in spring, we laid out an efficiency ratio which we then went on and spoke to what portion of that\u2019s consumer versus what\u2019s ICG. And we spoke to mid to high 50s for ICG. And so clearly those businesses have taken that on. And again, we\u2019ve talked about tepid top line growth in terms of low single digits, and the businesses have to onboard that, and they have. And they\u2019ve got to work to achieve that.","So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a mystery, or there\u2019s any surprise to what needs to be done. And again, I think those metrics were designed without looking at overreaching revenue targets. And so, again, I think they\u2019re in line, and we\u2019ll continue to adjust.","And I think you\u2019ve seen, away from the significant repositioning charge in the fourth quarter, us at a run rate somewhere plus or minus $100 million or $125 million a quarter. Again, going at it in that BAU we described. And obviously some of that\u2019s coming out of ICG, and we\u2019d expect them to keep continue doing that in their business.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","So how should I think about this? For the firm as a whole, revenues from the second to the third","quarter were down $1.6 billion, and expenses were down roughly $300 million. So that\u2019s a $1.3 billion gap linked quarter. To get the other $100 million of savings, it\u2019s still a $1.2 billion gap. So either revenues need to improve or stabilize in certain areas, or expenses have to go down a lot. Where is the extra leverage?","John Gerspach ","Mike, I still think you\u2019re focused on the quarter to quarter. And again, the targets that we set out were targets for a full year. And I think that when you take a look at performance, you want to judge the performance over a full year. Now, granted, if you want to take a look out of full year, that\u2019s okay. So judge us by how we perform then, over that full year, when we get there.","But the targets specifically that we set out for securities and banking back in March is we said that in 2015 we would be able to run securities and banking with an efficiency ratio of between 55% and 60%. And people at that point in time thought that that was a pretty good target to aim for. Well, in fact, if you take a look at our securities and banking business, on a trailing 12 month basis, we\u2019re operating that business at a 57% efficiency ratio.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Yeah, I guess the test will be a year from now, as we look back. Are you as confident as you were before that you\u2019ll have positive operating leverage looking ahead?","John Gerspach ","We\u2019re still committed to getting to the efficiency ratios that we laid out for 2015, as well as the ROA targets that we laid out for 2015.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","If I can shift gears, on Citi Holdings, what were the losses on the asset sales of $4 billion?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t have that number in my head. I\u2019m sorry.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","But it was a loss?","John Gerspach ","I don\u2019t even know. It could have been a slight net gain. I actually think it was a slight positive this quarter. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I called out the fact that the 0.5 in that upper left quadrant of that one chart is something that I think will likely come down, just because there were some episodic gains in that 0.5.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","So how should we think about pretax earnings and holdings? The last four quarters, it\u2019s gone from negative $1.7 billion, negative $1.3 billion, negative $900 million, negative $500 million. So that\u2019s a nice trend, but you said don\u2019t read too much into home price appreciation. So if we were trying to model that, what would you point us to?","John Gerspach ","Well, our target is still to drive holdings to breakeven, to close to breakeven, by 2015. And I think that we\u2019re still on a path to do that, but I don\u2019t want you to think that that path is going to be linear. There\u2019s likely to be some ups and downs in that. But in general, the trend is moving towards breakeven by 2015.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Since you\u2019re getting so close to that target now, why wouldn\u2019t you revise that projection from 2015 to, say, late 2014 even?","John Gerspach ","Well, the target that we put out was in March, so we\u2019re seven months into achieving a target that we said we would do over, you do the math. I guess it\u2019s somewhere around 33 months. So we still have 26 months to go to the end of 2015.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And then as it relates to emerging markets, you said revenues in Korea should stabilize early next year. With all the regulatory and other changes taking place there, what gives you that confidence?","John Gerspach ","Just the way we\u2019re looking at the business. And again, when I throw things out like that, that\u2019s what we think should happen. And it\u2019s based upon how we see the runoff in existing portfolios that we think are going to come down, and based upon the environment that we see. If there\u2019s a significant change in the environment, then, as we always do, we will update you on our new views.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","Can you remind us how long you\u2019ve been repositioning Korea? It\u2019s been a couple of years now?","John Gerspach ","It certainly has been in excess of one year, yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA ","And last question, going from what you can control to what you can\u2019t control, as it relates to the government situation in the U.S., have you been selling Treasuries to help protect yourself?","John Gerspach ","As a matter of fact, I got that question earlier today on the media call. And yes, we no longer hold any U.S. Treasuries that have a maturity date prior to November 1. And quite frankly we have a very de minimis amount that have maturities prior to November 16.","Operator","Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","On the card business, as you\u2019re seeing now kind of stabilization in the branded card business, and you\u2019ve got the Best Buy assets, there was a mention of actually reduced marketing. Can you talk a little bit about your plans, both for the branded card business and whether there are other opportunities out there to grow or acquire in the private label business?","John Gerspach ","You just went back and forth, so I want to make sure I answer the exact question that you\u2019ve put out. And I thought I heard you first ask about the branded cards business with marketing. And I think that you\u2019ll see that we are still in the process of repositioning the branded cards business. We did delay. We didn\u2019t have much to talk about with branded cards, quite frankly, in the third quarter. You\u2019re likely to see some additional advertising and marketing as we move into the fourth quarter. And hopefully what I think you\u2019ll see over the course of the fourth quarter, and then into 2014, is some new product offerings and some revitalized product offerings that we should have in branded cards. Your question on retail services, that\u2019s much more of an ongoing operation with the retail services, and the big change there of course is the acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio.","Mike Corbat ","And I would say to that point, it\u2019s been asked before, we\u2019re absolutely open to more portfolio purchases, but those portfolio purchases need to make sense from a yield, returns, resource deployment perspective. People have often said, well, do you rationalize it from a DTA perspective? One thing we look at are that the underlying fundamentals of the portfolio purchase have to make sense before we consider the DTA benefit. But if there are things out there that make sense, we\u2019ll certainly take a look at them.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse ","And on a slightly separate topic, the questions about Citi Holdings have been asked several different times, but you\u2019ve got $1.2 billion of revenue, and $1.4 billion in expenses. So your preprovision is a couple hundred million negative. But embedded in that expense is $600 million of legal. Is there kind of a run rate that you would expect kind of irrespective of all those volatile items of legal, and then something on top of that that we should expect? Or is that kind of not a way that you can look at it at this point.","John Gerspach ","Well, exactly what you have just pointed out is the exact point that I was trying to make by having you focus on the upper left quadrant of that slide that we had earlier, the four panel slide dealing with Citi Holdings. And you\u2019re right, when you move out the litigation expenses, we have $500 million of PPNR, adjusted PPNR, in that number.","The issue there is, as I mentioned, there\u2019s some element of episodic gains that is built into that number, and asset marks. And so I don\u2019t want you to think that represents a run rate. As you can imagine, holdings is a collection of some businesses, a lot of different portfolios, a couple of different assets, and so I don\u2019t want you to think in terms of now we\u2019ve hit a run rate of $500 million of adjusted PPNR in that business. It will fluctuate.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Right. Although I would assume that, One Main was alluded to before, that that\u2019s a big driver of that, and that\u2019s something that should be stable, if not actually growing, right?","John Gerspach ","Spot on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","John, a question for you just to follow up on your guidance in terms of operating leverage trends, specifically within Korea. You mentioned that you expect revenues to stabilize early in 2014, and that operating leverage would be positive in your forecast for the full year.","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019re linking two different comments that I made. The comment that I made on Korea as far as revenues stabilizing, that is particular to the global consumer business in Korea. The comment that I think I made as far as positive operating leverage in the second half of this year was on the transaction services business.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Then I guess what is your outlook for operating leverage trends within the Korea consumer business over the course of the next six to 12 months? Asia more broadly had slightly lower revenues year over year, but your expense control more than offset that within Asia. I guess I\u2019m just curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about the revenue trends within Korea could affect the overall Asia operating leverage trend?","John Gerspach ","Yeah, and it has a dampening effect on that trend, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we talked about the fact that Korea could be a drag on Asia performance over time. And so it will be a drag. But I didn\u2019t, nor do I want to, comment specifically on operating leverage in Korea itself, or in any other specific country.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","Just moving on to the slide on corporate loan details within Brazil, India, and China, which was very interesting, I guess I\u2019m just curious, given how low the loss rates are in those countries - and I appreciate a lot of that is due to the loan mix - are the loan mixes in some of your smaller exposures within EM markets similar in terms of the CTS and TF composition? Or are they more varied across the smaller exposures you have in EM?","John Gerspach ","Well, the loan composition in each country will be slightly different. You can see how the loan composition inside China, India, and Brazil are somewhat different. But the trend is still going to be much more towards loans for either local market champions - in other words those really high quality emerging market headquartered companies - or to subsidiaries of companies that are headquartered in the development markets, and then with a fairly decent dose, where we have it, of trade-related. So the mix will vary, but it\u2019s going to look something like this if you think about the way these three countries are portrayed.","Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then just one final question on the domestic mortgage portfolio. In the North American home equity portfolio within Citi Holdings, the credit performance has obviously gotten a lot better. I guess I\u2019m curious as to how you think about a higher rate environment potentially affecting the home equity portfolio specifically, and the ability of those homeowners to continue to make payments, or what the effect of a higher rate environment on that portfolio might be in terms of credit performance.","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019ve hit on the single largest risk that does impact the home equity book in holdings. And it\u2019s something that we think a lot about, and it drives a lot of our thought as far as what level of reserves that we need to have. We\u2019ve also given you some additional disclosure in our recent Qs as far as what percentage of that portfolio begins to hit resets in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917. I don\u2019t have all those numbers in my head, but if you go to our most recent Q, and we\u2019ll do it again on this upcoming Q, we\u2019ll lay that out for you as far as the reset risk that we have in that portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I just had one follow up question. On the four-panel slide that you referred to, the message is clear that adjusted PPNR may be lower than we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, but still positive. And when you said you\u2019re utilizing reserves for future chargeoffs, that implies to me your provision. I guess is it fair to conclude that when you get to breakeven, the holdings have to do with your legal and related costs at this point?","John Gerspach ","I would say that, again, there will be some variability, as you just laid out, in that upper quadrant. And I\u2019m not going to say that it could never go negative. I don\u2019t want you to think that that\u2019s always going to be positive. There\u2019s a chance it could go slightly negative depending upon how low the asset volumes get in the business, etc. But you\u2019re absolutely right, the single largest driver of when we are able to get to holdings to be consistently breakeven really has to do with the legal and related costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","I wanted to kind of go back to the CCAR question and just focus on dividends. As you\u2019re going through the reinstitution of your dividend, how do you think about that when you kind of look at the volatility of earnings that have been anywhere from a quarterly run rate of close to $1 this quarter or at the top end was close to $1.30, given the Fed gives you about a 30% kind of leeway. How do you think about that when you go to establish this dividend level going into next year?","John Gerspach ","I think when you look at it, the corporate finance math pretty clearly points you towards a preference of buyback versus dividend as your stock trades below book. And so I think that will be the first bias. But at that point, we also understand that we, to some degree, need to be mindful, and over time continue to address the dividend issue. So we\u2019ll look at those tradeoffs as we approach, but again, I think as has been very clearly signaled by the Fed, the bar around dividend is higher than buyback, just based on the nature of what a dividend is. And so we\u2019ll have to take that into account.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities ","And then just briefly touching on the expense versus revenue, the way you\u2019re looking at that trailing 12 months, is that just because the composition is more fixed with salary and bonus versus variable expenses, so that over time you kind of work your way through the ups and downs of revenue and create traction and efficiencies, but you\u2019re not going to be able to move as quickly to the quarterly fluctuations?","John Gerspach ","I\u2019d say that I still think that the best way to measure your efficiency is over time. And therefore, as you look at something over a trailing 12 month basis, you would have captured a full year of performance, and I really think that\u2019s the best way to judge how a firm is evidencing expense discipline.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities ","And I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that as much as I was trying to just get at is that just a difference in the way that the compensation is kind of set up now and structured, and looking at it over that time really is a better way to do that, because of the way the compensation is structured now?","John Gerspach ","I think it\u2019s a matter of how compensation is structured between deferrals of incentive comp. Much more is deferred now and recognized over three or four years, and so a lot of the compensation expense that you have in a year actually relates to performance in other years, as well as the operating performance that you have in the current year. Plus, there\u2019s different methodologies that firms employ in how they accrue compensation expense, and when they accrue compensation expense. But when you get to year-end, you have to have the expenses accrued for that year\u2019s performance, in that year. So that\u2019s why I continue to think that at any given point in time, you really want to measure people on a trailing 12 month basis.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities","And lastly, on page 38, you\u2019re showing the loan to value for mortgages in Citi Holdings, and you\u2019ve seen a marked improvement in those that have loan to values over 100%, to the point now that your reserves cover basically 100% of those balances when you start looking at those that have greater than 100% and FICOs less than 660. So when you\u2019re talking about home prices and the difference it makes, it does make a difference on this particular page, in that you\u2019re seeing migration into more stable and better-performing buckets. That would still be a positive you could see rolling forward, I would think.","John Gerspach ","And you\u2019re absolutely correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","You just sort of opened the can of worms on deferred comp, and I\u2019m wondering if you could just help me understand it a little bit. As we get to the end of the compensation year within securities and banking, can you just give us the amount of, just broadly, in hundreds of millions or billions, or whatever, the amount that would be awarded but not yet expensed? That would help us understand the ability to flex down the cost there. So I was wondering if you could just give us the awarded but not yet expensed at the end of the compensation year.","John Gerspach ","I\u2019m not prepared to do that at this point in time.","Derek De Vries - UBS ","And then maybe just a slightly more generic question then. I\u2019m trying to sort of reconcile the comments you made in the beginning, the challenging and uneven operating environment, with more of an upbeat backdrop on loan growth, particularly in emerging markets. And just as we go forward, should we think about the kind of growth rates that you\u2019ve been able to deliver recently? Or do you see some things that make you think that could slow down a little?","John Gerspach ","I would take a look at the overall environment and I do think that it does remain challenging. We have been able to grow loans in a challenging environment, although that loan growth has been a little bit less this year than it had been in years before. And even though you can continue to grow loans, then you have the other issue as far as spread compression. So you can continue to grow loans, but if you\u2019re growing loans at lower spreads, that not exactly going to be beneficial towards your revenue. So I think that you need to sort through how you think about both. I think we\u2019ve evidenced that we can certainly grow the volumes, but I think what you also see is that we have been impacted by a certain amount of spread compression, as have most other people in the industry.","Mike Corbat ","And as I think about it, there\u2019s two things in some ways in competition. I think as you look at growth estimates as we look forward for 2013, we\u2019ve seen, off of downward revisions in 2013 actually some uplifts in \u201914. But I think at the same point, when you go back and you look historically and you can look at several points of history, \u201994-95 certainly easily being one of those, any time in particular out of the U.S. you\u2019re transitioning into a higher rate environment, the EM economies don\u2019t come through that cleanly. I think in many ways today those economies are much better positioned to come through the shift towards higher rates, and whether that\u2019s a rise in foreign exchange reserves, whether that\u2019s floating exchange rate mechanisms, external liquidity, and you can go on and on through those. But again, I just think a transitioning U.S. interest rate is certainly going to have an impact on trading volumes, capital flows, new issuance calendars. And so I think we\u2019ve got to try and strike a balance between those things.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","I won\u2019t beat up on the securities and banking efficiency ratio question, even though that\u2019s up 10 percentage points linked quarter. Let\u2019s turn to the other two businesses that are almost two-thirds of your revenues, GTS and global consumer banking. So following a little bit of your trail of thought, John, you\u2019re looking at it year to date. GTS efficiency ratios up from, I believe, 52% to 54%, and global consumer bank is up also from 53% to 54%. So even though you\u2019re more than halfway through your cost restructuring, your efficiency ratios are going the other direction. Can you talk to that a little bit, especially given your confidence about GTS for the second half?","John Gerspach ","I think what you\u2019re going to see in transaction services - and I said it before - I think you\u2019ll start to see improvement beginning in the fourth quarter. And that improvement should begin to then roll forward through next year\u2019s results as well. And I have no doubt that transaction services will meet the efficiency targets that we set out for them for 2015. Consumer has been bumping around at, as you mentioned, 53-54% probably, if I look at it on a trailing 12 month basis, for the last five quarters maybe. But there\u2019s still work to go there. They have not fully completed the rollout of rainbow yet. And obviously we\u2019re still in the process of readjusting the mortgage business. So they\u2019ve got that running through the top line, and we haven\u2019t quite gotten the expenses out in mortgages yet. And the commitment was that we would get consumer to 47% to 50% by 2015. And so I still think that we\u2019re on track to do that.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Even though so far you\u2019ve gone the other direction? You\u2019re over half [unintelligible] in \u201914. Okay, a couple of little ones. Private label, I just want to come back to that. Did you add anything for that in the third quarter?","John Gerspach ","There was a very small amount, because don\u2019t forget we only had the Best Buy\u2026","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","No, sorry, private label MBS. My apologies.","John Gerspach ","I\u2019m sorry. When it comes to private label securitizations, I\u2019m not going to comment about any specific reserving in the quarter.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","And then turning to Best Buy, did you take on any delinquencies with that?","John Gerspach ","Again, when it comes to the Best Buy, we did take on delinquencies. And so the delinquencies do end up in our statistics. It\u2019s just that, from a reserving point of view, we don\u2019t pick up loan loss reserves.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","And those are not marked down, the loan portfolios?","John Gerspach ","The loan portfolios come on our books on a fair market value basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses Management.","Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management","I\u2019m referring to slide 21, 26, and slide 41. You\u2019ve managed to keep your risk-weighted assets pretty flat, actually declining, on a Basel III basis. And at the same time, you seem to be growing your regulatory capital currently at a $15 billion rate and rising. I\u2019m just wondering, how do we think about capital adequacy going forward? And given your capital build rate, at some point we need to think a little bit more holistically about what you do with that. Could you give us at least the basis to understand that?","John Gerspach ","You\u2019ve got a lot of questions wrapped up in there. Let me try to parse through a little bit of that, and you come back where I\u2019ve failed. From a capital build rate, certainly the capital is building as a result of the earnings, as well as the DTA. So this quarter, the earnings themselves were a lot of $3 billion, the DTA was a benefit of $500 million, then we also had a benefit of OCI, which of course from a Basel III basis ends up in that as well. So, over the course of the quarter, we actually built about $4.5 billion worth of regulatory capital from those three components. What we\u2019ve said is that our expectation is over time we would target running at a 10% Basel III ratio. Now, we need to think about how we may change that as the supplemental leverage ratio rules begin to finalize, but that\u2019s where we are right now. So what have I failed to answer?","Adam Hurwich - Ulysses Management ","You didn\u2019t fail to answer anything. The only reason I\u2019m asking this is because there seems to be a lot of focus on GAAP numbers, but there\u2019s a large discrepancy between GAAP and regulatory capital measures. And there seems to be a benefit that you will accrue due to that differential. Am I missing anything, or in fact when regulators are comfortable with the bank, will we be able to see a benefit from the discrepancy?","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019re right. As a matter of fact, one of the things that we talk about is the fact that as we think about the strategies for our Citicorp businesses, we think that those Citicorp businesses operate in a very Basel III friendly way. We\u2019re focused on real high-level credit worthy customers in both the consumer businesses as well as in the corporate business, and we think we can run the business, as I say, in a very efficient manner under Basel III. It maybe referenced in one of the slides that we have in the appendix that shows the returns that we get on a Basel III basis. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed with the strategy. As far as how the regulators view us and what might be the future, again, we think that we\u2019re in fairly constructive dialogs with the regulators.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","A couple of ticky-tack questions. Just to follow on that last question, in terms of capital, can you help us understand, is there a material difference in terms of tier one common Basel III under the standardized approach versus the advanced?","John Gerspach ","There\u2019s a very large difference between the way those two calculations work, and under the terms of Dodd-Frank, what large banks in the U.S. are directed to do is report the lower of the two ratios. So currently we are reporting our ratios under the advanced approach.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","Which is the lower of the two?","John Gerspach ","Yes, by definition. I couldn\u2019t report it if it wasn\u2019t.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then separately, you had mentioned, in terms of unfunded commitments, there was a reserve build, partly due to growth in commitments, as well as some risk migration downward. Can you help clarify exactly what was going on there in terms of risk migration?","John Gerspach ","In our commitments book, we took a look at some of the commitments we had to our clients, especially clients that are in countries where the country itself ends up being risk weighted lower. We therefore re-rate the company, and therefore ended up building a bit more reserves.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","Should we expect continued build in unfunded commitment reserves? Or is this kind of a one-time adjustment?","John Gerspach ","I wouldn\u2019t call it a one-time adjustment, but it\u2019s another one of those episodic adjustments. I don\u2019t anticipate that level of migration repeating in the fourth quarter, but I can\u2019t tell you that it absolutely won\u2019t, either.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And then lastly, just bigger picture, in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis. You had mentioned you expect it may be flattish in the fourth quarter. But then beyond that, is it fair to assume that there will be still kind of this gradual grind down in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis, given the global spread compression that you\u2019ve referenced?","John Gerspach ","I think as long as we stay in a low interest rate environment, you\u2019re going to have, as you put it, that grind down approach. I would think at some point in time we would begin to see some level of interest rate increase, and then you could get a bit of a benefit. Until then, it\u2019s going to be really a matter of how the calculus works out between your ability to grow loans and lower your cost of funding, how those two factors offset the impact of the continued spread compression.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners ","And lastly, just to wrap it kind of maybe back to the first question, on this long call, of kind of getting to your longer term ROA goal, what would be your view of a normalized interest margin over the cycle to get into that 90\/110 ROA basis?","John Gerspach ","We didn\u2019t really talk about that at that point in time, and I don\u2019t really have a longer term NIM goal that I care to share at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","Just one quick question on TSS. You indicated that the operating leverage, you\u2019re expecting second half to be positive. Can you just give us a sense as to is that versus first half, is that year on year, and the major drivers there?","John Gerspach ","It would be year on year. In other words, it would be the second half of 2013 compared to the second half of 2012.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And the drivers?","John Gerspach ","The drivers would be revenue growth being larger than expense growth. I\u2019m only kidding, sorry.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","No, I get operating leverage. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s really you\u2019re banking on it being more revenue related than expense related.","John Gerspach ","No, actually I think you\u2019re going to see some good expense performance coming out of the fourth quarter.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","And then in retail banking, ex the mortgage, on the revenue margins there, got the message that it was competitive environment and you need to be competitive to get the volume growth. That\u2019s been a trend over the past couple of quarters. So we should continue to expect that going forward? I\u2019m just asking for some color from the field as to how you\u2019re thinking about it.","John Gerspach ","On mortgage revenues in particular?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley ","No, excluding mortgage revenues. So, retail banking margins are down. Excluding mortgage related.","John Gerspach ","I think you\u2019re still going to see some pressure in retail banking, just due to, again, that low interest rate environment, and the impact there for that low interest rate on the deposit taking business that we have in the retail bank.

Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018 or $1.73 per share. We continue to see solid growth this quarter in many areas, including our accrual businesses and ICG, fixed income, and Mexico Consumer and despite a drag from net one-time gains that affected our top line comparisons, we still achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, driving our efficiency ratio down to 56.1%.","Loans and deposits, both grew year-over-year and our return on assets increased to 95 basis points. We're on track to achieve our 2018 financial target, on a year-to-date basis we've generated 4% underlying growth in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses. Our efficiency ratio is 57.3% and we achieved a return on tangible common equity of 11.2%, keeping us on track to exceed our original target of 10.5% for the full year.","We returned $6.4 billion of capital to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the quarter and over the past 12 months, we've reduced our common shares outstanding by over $200 million or 8%. Combined with our operating performance, our earnings per share were 22% higher than one year ago.","Turing to the businesses, in Global Consumer Banking, we saw solid growth in Mexico, even when you back out the gain on the sale of our asset management business. In Asia, we saw some headwinds in our more market sensitive investment products. But the remainder of the franchise showed consistent growth. And in the U.S., we're starting to see the impact of the L.L. Bean portfolio and retail services where revenue continued to grow.","Branded Cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year. Our Institutional Clients Group grew by 4%, excluding a one-time gain from last year. Fixed Income and equities were up 7% in total and as in the past our accrual businesses, TTS Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank all showed strong year-over-year growth. ","Investment banking was down versus last year as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry. The client dialogues remained solid and we feel good about the pipeline and upcoming transactions.","During the quarter, we also made some changes to make certain our structure is completely aligned with our strategic goals. In North America, we shifted to the same regional model we have in Asia and Latin America and have asked Anand Selva to run what is our largest consumer market. His experience in Asia where we operate a client centric franchise with strong digital adoption will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale in credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.","In ICG, we\u2019re combining corporate and investment banking with capital markets origination, by integrating advisory services with capital raising, we believe we will ensure an even greater focus on our clients. And Paco Ybarra will become Jamie Forese\u2019s deputy, giving Paco a platform to focus on technology and capital optimization across our institutional businesses.","And as you know, several senior leaders at our firm have decided to retire among them John Gerspach, but the good news is, is this isn\u2019t your last call with John since he won\u2019t be leaving until we file our 2018 financial statements.","With that John, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to go through the presentation and then we\u2019re happy to take questions.","John Gerspach","Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, net income of $4.6 billion in the third quarter grew 12% from last year. Largely driven by a lower effective tax rate and EPS grew 22%, including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.4 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, reflecting the net impact of one-time gain in the third quarters of both 2017 and 2018, as well as FX translation. ","As a reminder, last year, we recorded a gain of approximately $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in ICG. And this year, our results include a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico Asset Management business in consumer. In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise.","Despite the revenue headwind from net one-time gains, we achieved positive operating leverage this quarter with our efficiency ratio improving year-over-year to 56.1%. Constant credit was down slightly versus last year as lower reserve builds in consumer were largely offset by volume growth and the normalization of credit costs in ICG. And excluding the gains in both periods, pre-tax earnings grew 8% year-over-year.","In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $675 billion. GCB and ICG loans grew by 6% or $37 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS the private bank and traditional corporate lending.","Looking at year-to-date results on slide four, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains. On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4% in line with our medium term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending and the private bank and consumer revenues have grown 3% in constant dollars, somewhat below our medium term goal.","Now this is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia Wealth Management revenues, the impact of partnership terms that came into effect earlier this year in U.S. branded cards, which we will lap as we go into 2019.","And finally, in U.S. Retail, a drag from lower U.S. mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity. Despite these headwinds we've made good progress on expenses, bringing our year-to-date efficiency ratio down to 57.3%. Credit quality remains broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pre-tax earnings grew 5%. EPS grew by 24%, including the benefit of share buybacks as well as a lower effective tax rate. And our year-to-date RoTCE is 11.2%, well above our full year target of 10.5%.","Turning now to the third quarter, slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 36% in the third quarter, largely driven by lower cost of credit, a lower effective tax rate and the gain on the sale of Mexico Asset Management business. ","Total revenues of $8.7 billion, grew 3% year-over-year, reflecting the strength in Latin America as well as the one-time gain, and expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, driven by the timing of investment initiatives versus the prior year. On a sequential basis, expenses were flat and year-to-date both revenues and expenses grew 4% versus last year.","Slide six shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. In total, third quarter revenues of $5.1 billion were down 1% from last year. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continue to decline mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs.","Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first half of the year largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity. While deposit spreads continued to improve year-over-year, the pace of improvements slowed this quarter led by a deposit mix shift in our commercial portfolio.","Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. Assets under management grew 9% to $64 billion. In aggregate, deposits and assets under management grew slightly year-over-year as strong growth in Citigold households and balances more than offset other outflows. ","Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year. Now excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 11% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 4%, including 7% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature. This growth in interest-earnings balances is driving a positive mid shift in our portfolio.","As a result, on a sequential basis, our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or net interest revenue percentage improved as expected by over 20 basis points and our net interest revenues grew by 5%. We expect the NIR percentage to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, resulting in year-over-year spread expansion that should continue into 2019.","For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenues in Branded Cards to be roughly flat; however we remain on track to achieve 2% underlying growth. This underlying growth should accelerate and translate into reported growth in 2019, even considering the Hilton and Visa B gains we took earlier this year.","Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L. Bean card portfolio, partially offset by higher partner payments.","Total expenses for North America consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period. On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter. ","Turning to credit, total credit costs were down 20% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower reserve build in both Branded Cards and retail services relative to last year. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards was 291 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 458 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018. ","On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Third quarter revenues of $3.5 billion grew 11%, driven by strength in Latin America, as well as the previously mentioned one-time gain. In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8%, driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage and card loans, as well as deposits. ","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues, given a weaker market sentiment. Over the last 12 months, Asia Consumer revenues grew 4%, in line with our medium term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues excluding investment products.","While investment product revenues are more market sensitive and can be variable quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ve seen growth overtime consistent with our growth in clients and assets under management. And we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable accrual type investment revenues, as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions.","In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the third quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. And constant credit grew 17%, reflecting loan growth as well as the impact of a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period.","Slide eight, shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter across regions. The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic promotional charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release and therefore neutral to cost of credit.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis, with strength in both banking and markets. Total banking revenues of $4.9 billion grew 2%. ","Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 4% as reported and 8% in constant dollars. Reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes, loans and deposits. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity.","Private Bank revenues of $849 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging cost. ","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 8%, excluding the gain last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year with contribution from both rates and currencies as well as spread products.","Equities revenues were up 1%, as strength in prime finance and derivatives was largely offset by lower revenues in cash equities, reflecting a more challenging trading environment and lower commissions. And finally, in Securities Services revenues were up 11% as reported and 15% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.","Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year, as higher compensation costs, investments and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally cost of credit was $71 million this quarter, reflecting loan growth.","Slide 10 shows the results for Corp\/Other. Revenues of $494 million declined 5% from last year, driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 44%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower infrastructure costs. And pre-tax income was $65 million this quarter, better than our outlook reflecting higher treasury revenues and lower infrastructure expenses relative to our prior expectations.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest pre-tax loss in Corp\/Other, mostly driven by seasonally higher franchise wide marketing and regulatory consulting cost, relative to the third quarter.","Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. As you can see total net interest revenue were $11.8 billion this quarter, grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other.","Core accrual net interest revenue grew by roughly $970 million year-over-year and our core accrual net interest margin improved by 12 basis points to 360 basis points, driven by rate increases, loan growth and an improved loan mix versus last year.","On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates as well as loan growth along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter. However core accrual net interest margin remain flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter. ","Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in line with the $970 million we saw this quarter. So the growth in our core accrual net interest revenue should approach $3.7 billion for full year 2018. However, as a reminder, on a full year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind down portfolio in corporate\/other. And trading related net interest revenue will likely to continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we've seen year-to-date.","On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter our CET-1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 11.8% as net income was more than offset by share buybacks and dividends and we saw an increase in risk weighted assets related to client activity. And our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.91.","Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In ICG, equity and fixed income market revenues should reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third to the fourth quarter. However, we currently expect revenues to be higher on a year-over-year basis. ","Turning to investment banking, revenue should reflect the overall environment, but given our current backlog, we expect revenues to be up both sequentially and year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Lending and the Private Bank. ","In consumer, in North America we expect to see somewhat better growth in the retail banking, excluding mortgage as well as retail services. In U.S. Branded Cards, total revenues will continue to reflect the impact of the Hilton sale as well as partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year. However, the net interest revenue percentage should improve both sequentially and year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico.","Cost of credit should remain fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. And we remain on track to achieve roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement this year. This will put us at a 57.3% efficiency ratio for the full year. Even though the fourth quarter revenues will likely see some pressure sequentially given the normal seasonal decline in trading revenues, our expenses should also decline modestly on lower compensation costs and better efficiency savings. This should put our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter roughly in line with our performance year-to-date. And finally, our tax rate should be in the range of 24% to 25%.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Good morning. John I wanted to -- yes, as we look at to your 2020 financial targets. At a high level, you're projecting a widening of the operating leverage jazz next year and acceleration of the efficiency improvement that you're already having. So I guess as we look out in that plan, is it fair that you expect that widening of the operating leverage to be partly driven by stronger revenues and partly by slower expense growth as we look out?","John Gerspach","Yes, I mean, John I think we're consistent with what we laid out at Investor Day last year. We've been talking about certainly during the first nine months of this year, which is that we continue to expect revenue growth largely in line with GDP and call that that 4% or so revenue growth in our core businesses, say 3% overall. So we are expecting some degree of revenue growth and basically holding expenses flat over that period. ","John McDonald","Got you. And then the efficiency improvement this quarter seem to be concentrated in the corp. and other segment. Are we getting to the point where the incremental savings will start being reflected in the core businesses as we look out?","John Gerspach","You\u2019ll see, as we said, consumer expenses staying stable next quarter, but again, last quarter John, we talked about the fact that from an investment point of view, we were about 50% through our investment spend, and at that point in time about a third of the way through generating the expense efficiencies associated with those investments. Both of those have picked up, we are starting to see that gap begin to close, it certainly visible to us in the details I can't say that it's going to be visible to you in the fourth quarter in the each of the businesses, but you'll certainly see that in 2019.","John McDonald","Got you. Okay. And one more quick follow-up in terms of the card revenues starting to look better next year seems like the core revenue growth rate feels like 2% this year and will accelerate next year on a core basis. Is that really driven by the decline in promotional balances and the impact on net interest yield? ","John Gerspach","John, it's two things. I mean, we continue of course to grow the -- I think it's more of the fact that as those promotional balances run down, we're continuing to convert a lot of those balances into full rate revolving balances. We talked last quarter about the fact that we saw that conversion rate at something just below 50% and that we continue to see that type of performance.","So you've got that mix of the net interest earning balances growing and I referenced it is 7% growth in the net interest earning balances this quarter. And then you combine that with the decline in the promo balances. And that's really what's fueling that revenue growth that we see going into next year.","So, as we look forward, we expect those interest earning balances to continue to grow and then a larger percentage of that growth gradually comes from the higher margin proprietary product balances. So, promotional rate loans decline, the other balances grow and that's what's driving it. This is all part of what we're trying to achieve by getting the right balance in our U.S. Branded Cards portfolio. We've talked about this in the past.","And I think that what you're going to see is that by the end of 2019, we should have a well balanced portfolio with the appropriate mix of both interest bearing and non-interest bearing receivables. And then importantly within each of those categories, we have the right balance of -- on the interest earnings balances, the right balance between co-brand and proprietary products. And then in the non-interest bearing the right mix of promotional and transacted balances. So all of that is really what's going to fuel that revenue growth that you're going to see in 2019 and then beyond.","John McDonald","Got you. Thank you.","John Gerspach","It\u2019s all right.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell ","Good morning, John. ","John Gerspach","Hi, Jim. ","Jim Mitchell ","Hey. Maybe just following up on John's prior question on cards, as you noted, the net interest or the NIR percentage grew 23 bps to 851. Where do you see that selling long-term, obviously prior to all the [indiscernible] rating Costco these [ph] rate cards you were doing north of nine? Is that something where you could get back to? How do we think about that longer term potential revenue yields in the card business? ","John Gerspach","Yes, I don't think that we're right in the position now Jim to give you a long-term goal on net interest percentage. A lot of that's going to depend on, where the interest rate environment settle out.","Jim Mitchell ","Sure. ","John Gerspach","And then just how successful we are in driving that right balance. But we certainly see it growing higher in 2019.","Jim Mitchell ","Okay. And do you think the conversion of -- at about less than 50%. Does that slow loan growth, but also help on the credit side? How do we think about that trade off?","John Gerspach","Well, it does slow loan growth a little bit. But I think it's -- if you're focused on growing loans and only growing loans, we could put out those promotional balances all day long and grow loans. And then you\u2019d be asking me about, where's the revenue. And so what -- again what you do is with those promotional balances you\u2019re hoping that those clients, once they finish with the promotional period will like the value preposition that they see based on the card that they have taken and then stick with you and convert to a full rate revolving loan and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing.","So we\u2019re happy to trade-off some reduction in the growth of non-interest bearing loans for faster growth in interest bearing loans. ","Jim Mitchell ","Right. And I was just asking does that help on the credit side, as you get rid of those non-interest bearing loans that roll-off, that\u2019s all. Do you get a little help with that.","John Gerspach","I mean, as far as for me from an NCL percentage point of view. ","Jim Mitchell ","Yes. ","John Gerspach","Yes, it might but hopefully we\u2019re getting the right growth elsewhere as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t -- I certainly wouldn\u2019t describe any part of our NCL rate being they\u2019re holding at around that 3% or 3.25% as something to do with the fact that we\u2019re quickly running off promotional balances.","Jim Mitchell ","Okay, I mean that\u2019s fine. And just maybe just one other, maybe forgive me if I missed your comment on fix rating, but you guys obviously at least so far what we\u2019ve seen outperformed I think our expectations. Is that really largely the EM volatility that we have seen, how do we think about that with respect to fix? And also I guess longer term if you\u2019re worried about some of these movements in currencies.","John Gerspach","Actually when we talk about the strong performance in rates and currencies this quarter, it was really centered more so in G10 rates and G10 FX. And I\u2019d say it\u2019s fueled by a combination of strong corporate client activity and also our ability to navigate a fairly interesting trading environment in the second half of the quarter. There was a good amount of market volatility in the second half of the quarter due to a combination of U.S. interest rate moves and pressure on the euro resulting from the situation in Turkey and I think our guys did a great job navigating that environment.","Jim Mitchell ","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. ","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. ","John Gerspach"," Hi, Glenn. ","Glenn Schorr","Hello there. Quickly on Mexico and Asia, the good on Mexico I am just curious on the removal of the NAFTA headwind if that increases your confidence in your 10 percentage growth expectations, which has been good. And maybe a flip side question on Asia, good explanation on market sensitive stuff laying down decent underlying growth, but in the 4% 2020 target that\u2019s a full package, right? In another words markets good and bad, but we\u2019re still expecting 4% growth through 2020 targets.","Mike Corbat","Yes, so if you take each of those pieces. So one is we like the fact that there is a deal on the table, obviously it needs to be ratified by all three governments, hopefully we hear back fairly quickly from Mexico and from Canada. We have got political backdrop we\u2019ve got to work our way through the mid-term et cetera here. But I think the deal that\u2019s on the table and getting behind that us would be important. I would say we stay committed on the 10%, I would argue Glenn that kind of near to intermediate term NAFTA likely has a bigger impact on our institutional flows than our consumer flows.","And so where you look, I think what we have seen is the result of some of the skirmish back and forth is I think you have seen FDI go down, you have seen more volatility in the currency, I think you have seen U.S. business inbound to Mexico probably more conservative and I think you have seen Mexican business was more conservative.","So I actually view this as probably having a bigger benefit near to intermediate term for what happens in our institutional business and I would say from our core business we\u2019re watching longer term the impact of heading into the inauguration, heading into the budget in December and then kind of watching what comes out in terms of fiscal discipline, social programs, et cetera and then how that translates domestically into what happens in the economy, which will have the bigger impact in our opinion on the consumer business.","I think in Asia, when you look across our Asia franchise that 4% growth across the footprint in consumer is again to use John\u2019s words, it\u2019s pretty balanced and as we look into those franchises we see good growth, you saw in this quarter actually pretty good underlying cards growth. We saw pretty good underlying growth everything other than the wealth management.","And I think as historic and as expected when we get these periods of heighten volatility the wealth product tends to pull back, but again constructively when you look at what's going on in terms of AUM, we continue to build AUM and provided this isn't some prolonged period of extraordinarily heightened volatility. We'd expect those wealth management revenues to recover and therefore putting us on track for that 4%. ","John Gerspach","Glenn, we actually put a slide in the back of the earnings deck slide 20. Just to sort of make some of the points that Mike is just making, we recognize that right now the franchise is still it's a little overweight towards wealth management. And -- but the wealth management revenues it\u2019s going to give us some volatility. But if you take a look at it how it's performed over the past two years, the overall franchise has been growing at about 4% right in line with where we've targeted out to 2020. And wealth management has grown 6%.","So it's been performing, but it does give us a little volatility. Now we are still as I said a bit overweight, and we've got several initiatives underway to increase the proportion of what I would called more stable accrual type revenues. And that includes a focus on lending. And if you look at how our loans have been growing, they've been growing in a nice cliff.","Now there is a good portion of our loan book in Asian consumer that we're not looking to grow, mortgages very low margin loans. But if you strip out mortgages, the underlying loans cards, personal installment loans, they've been growing at a rate of about 7% year-to-date. And even when it comes to investment products, we're changing the fee structure on many of our investment products more towards a trailing fee structure that we have here in the states as oppose to what now is very heavily reliant on upfront fees.","So that overtime is going to bring Asia more in line with our fee structure in the U.S. and it will also tend to make the revenues a bit more stable. So we will liked what's going on in Asia and we're still very comfortable with that 4% growth factor out to 2020.","Glenn Schorr","Awesome. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. ","John Gerspach","Hey, Mike. ","Mike Mayo","My first question is for Mike, since we talked to you last, you installed a new Head of U.S. Banking. And I guess this person will oversee credit cards and other retail products and distribution. So what are you trying to achieve with that new management change? And why now and what kind of metrics will you monitor to make sure this change is successful -- will be a success?","Mike Corbat","Sure. So as I described in my preamp, really what we're trying to do here and what we're trying to accomplish in many ways mimics the structure that we already have in Mexico and that we already have in Asia, where we\u2019ve got regional heads who have the ability to view the franchise were important to view the customer holistically. And if you go back and think in many ways of the history of Citi it was Citi Card and Citi Mortgage and Citi this and Citi that. We had a series of bilateral relationships through products with our clients often times not necessarily knowing or understanding the entirety of the relationship.","I think the work that was done in terms of Rainbow and other technology implementations now gives us the ability to view the client holistically. Why now is because when you go back and look at the work we needed to do from products of getting a card suite built out, of getting contract renegotiations, et cetera, et cetera. We had a lot of work to get done and we've now gotten to the place where we feel like we've got the products, we've got the platform, we've seen this work, it's proven successful for us in the other two regions and the time felt right.","And with Anand having very successfully driven our business in Asia, we thought given the things that we're trying to accomplish here and a good bench not just in Asia but Mexico and other places that it would be the right time to make this move.","So, we\u2019re excited about it Anand is pulling the team together it\u2019s early days for him, but he brought a lot of energy to it and we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s ahead. ","Mike Mayo","And any metrics that you\u2019ll monitor to make sure this is successful in terms of profitability or growth?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think it\u2019ll be the combination, so in there I said in my preamble not only brings strong traditional consumer banking, but has really been at the forefront in our firm in terms of the whole digital adoption and the push towards digital obviously that\u2019s extremely relevant and prevalent in Asia. So, one is we\u2019re going to continue to make the push, because around the combination of revenue growth, customer satisfaction as well as expense trajectory digital plays an important part of that.","So there will be digital metrics some of which we\u2019re showing external today, obviously it\u2019s the continued growth and continued push around deposit and deposit capture not just within our traditional physical footprint, but as we talk about on a national wide basis and what we do there. And then part of the value preposition that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of how we do that and how we drive more growth, as an example is taking advantage of our broad footprint of credit card holders not just across the U.S., but around the world and using various forms of digital interaction and various types of incentives or rewards to get more out of those relationships and we\u2019ll have metrics against all those.","Mike Mayo","Great. And last follow-up maybe for you or for John. So, you have consolidated the platform, you\u2019ve consolidated cards, you\u2019re in a position where you can do this now. So will you be getting additional disclosure as relates to North America consumer whether it\u2019s digital banking or a slice indicing a few different ways for us externally?","John Gerspach","Mike when you say additional disclosure you mean other than the break outs that we give you right now as far as Branded Cards, retail services and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region.","Mike Mayo","Or it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how you\u2019re doing with products and customers or you had a lot more capability internally, given what you have done with project Rainbow and I thought that was a good reference like a decade or two to consolidate all the retail system and after all there is earlier acquisitions. So now that you have these capabilities to serve customers, maybe you can provide us with more information on any incremental success you\u2019re having. ","John Gerspach","Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve taken a first stab of that, if you take a look at the slide 24 in the appendix, maybe in the future we can do a little bit more of this on a regional basis, right now we\u2019re tracking everything globally. So, we\u2019ll see how we build this into something else.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you. ","John Gerspach","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Hello.","John Gerspach","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Actually just a follow-up on the last line of thinking here, as you talk about kind of deepening the retail bank relationship obviously part of that is could it be the national digital banking effort trying to get deposits. But beyond the Card and the deposit gathering like do you think you have the product set and the kind of scale in some other areas. Because, I guess, my perception is you are a lot smaller in mortgage than kind of some peers of your size, auto, I think you either pulled out or you\u2019re very small there. Like are there other areas that you feel like you need to enter or bulk up so that you really have the offering for the customer base.","Mike Corbat","So, John why don\u2019t I start, I think when you look at mortgage or you look at auto today in each of those cases the predominance of those products, as an example more than half of mortgages originate in United States today are originated by non-banks. Over 80% of auto loans originated till today are originated by non-banks. And so I think we look to play in our sweet spot in terms of broadly defined payment of cards and where payments are headed. Wealth management and so the combination of then the Citigold type depository and product offering with the combine suite of investment options or opportunities on the back of that.","And so, again, we think that that is a good suite. And as we look at consumer preferences, that's probably the tighter bundle that's actually there today. And I think when you look at people either Morgan shopping or auto loan shopping, you tend to see those as more of kind of one-off type transactions as to our approach is more of the relationship approach of trying to broaden some of the products we have.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And on the investment and wealth side I mean you\u2019ve had some good momentum on the investment sales in terms of growth rates. Do you think you've got the scale that you need in that area as you think about going national and trying to really penetrate the card customer base?","Mike Corbat","Again the platform exists and we can -- I won't say infinitely scale it, but we can certainly easily scale it and the platforms of connectivity, all of that's there. And so again, whether we do it out of a branch on Fifth Avenue or whether we do it online, we've got the same connectivity to the products.","John Gerspach","And Matt what, again, we've never said that, we're never going to build another branch. If as we show success in penetrating those especially those card clients that are outside of our six named cities right now. If we start to see concentrations we\u2019ll be looking to build wealth centers around those population areas as well. So to Mike's point, we think that initially we can scale off of our mobile or digital platform and then if required, we're more than willing to scale up physically as well selectively.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And do you think the preference would be to build organically or would you be more open to maybe buying a branch network than you've been in the past? ","John Gerspach","I would say more likely now to build organically. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And if I could just squeeze in a completely separate question, the charge-offs in Latin America ticked up a bit both linked quarter and year-over-year, but the delinquencies actually went down.","John Gerspach","If you look, we actually try to make a comment on that focused on slide, I think it\u2019s eight where we give you those credit statistics. And you see that tick up to a 4.63% NCL rate in the third quarter, that's really being driven by one commercial credit that went to write-off that we had previously reserved. So it did show the NCL rate tick up and it had absolutely no impact on our cost of credit. And as you still correctly note, it doesn't impact our delinquency statistics at all.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Sorry, I missed that comment. Thank you. ","John Gerspach","That's okay. I say a lot. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","John Gerspach","Hey Ken. are you on mute.","Operator","Ken Usdin, your line is open. ","Ken Usdin","Hi. Can you hear me? ","John Gerspach","Yes. ","Mike Corbat","We got you. ","Ken Usdin","Sorry about that. Okay. So thanks. Real quick, I wanted to ask you just about the deposit insurance fund assessment. And can you just kind of walk us through are you expecting it to be out in the fourth quarter? And since you guys account for through NII. Just what do we need to understand about how that will move through in terms of NIM going forward as well?","John Gerspach","So you talked about the surcharge, right? ","Ken Usdin","Correct. ","John Gerspach","Yes, and you're right. But we have the surcharge. The surcharge costs us about $140 million a quarter and that the roll off of that surcharge is not embedded in the guidance that I gave earlier. As far as net interest revenues growing by somewhere in that same range as they grew in the third quarter, that $970 million. So if it did roll off in the fourth quarter that would be some upside.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then you obviously continue to account for that in NIM going forward. When we think about it on a segment basis is that spread out everywhere or is it in corporate other? How do we see that come through the segments?","John Gerspach","No, we actually push it down. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. So when it comes out, it'll be a nice little helper to the both the segment NIMs and also the corporate level.","John Gerspach","That is correct, sir. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. Understood. One quick one, just on credit. Latin America losses were up a little bit. And I don't know if that was the seasonal versus just any change there. Can you just talk us through if there was any just notable change in underlying?","John Gerspach","No, the tick up in net credit losses in Latin America really stem from one commercial credit that we took to write-off this quarter. But we had already fully reserved for it. So it really had no impact on our reported earnings out of Latin America. It just shows up as an increase in the NCL and then if you look at reserves, it's coming out of the reserve, because obviously we leased the reserve. But I think importantly you'll note that our Latin America delinquencies really had no appreciable change. As a matter of fact, they actually went down both sequentially and year-over-year.","Ken Usdin","Yes, okay. All right, thanks very much, John.","John Gerspach","No problem at all, Ken. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good afternoon. ","John Gerspach","Hi, Betsy. ","Mike Corbat","Hey, Betsey. ","Betsy Graseck","Hey. Couple of questions, one is just on how the steepening of the yield curve is helping you out, and in particular the European yield curve. Because I think there is a little more exposure there than most banks. And I currently wanted to get an understanding from you as to how it's impacting your forward-look?","John Gerspach","Betsy, we really are still much more exposed to movement on the short end of the curve. And I think you see that in the disclosures that we give you both in the Qs and the Ks. So we really don't have a great deal of exposure on the long end of the curve either in euro or in U.S.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So you go out like two years is that it or?","John Gerspach","I'd say when I look at everything it's more short rate compared to let's say three years. Because three -- if you take a look at our investment portfolio, our investment portfolio probably has an average tenure just below three years 2.7 something like that. So it's really more looking at it on the short rate out to the three year.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then separately, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about planning for the potential risk of the Sears [ph] bankruptcy either filing Chapter 7, Chapter 11 not sure which way it\u2019s going to go right now, but seemingly likely to come on Monday. Can you just give us a update on how you're thinking about your position there?","John Gerspach","Obviously we're not in a position to comment on the likelihood that Sears will commence bankruptcy proceedings. But Sears has been a 15 year card partner of Citi Retail Services. And the portfolio does continue to deliver strong returns for us. If you do look at the portfolio itself and just to put everything in perspective, the portfolio consists it's primarily MasterCard general purpose accounts.","And as we\u2019ve said in the past over 70% of the customer spend of that portfolio is outside of Sears. That's consistent with what we would consider to be top of wallet customer behavior. And we\u2019ve seen already that the retailer has already taken actions to close stores and restructure its operations. And that has already been embedded in our financial planning, and is embedded in the outlooks that we've given you and the targets that we've set.","So we don't expect a Chapter 11 filing to have an immediate impact on Citi at all. Now if the Sears bankruptcy resulted in accelerated store closures, would likely have the effect of slowing new acquisitions. We have to ramp up our engagement with existing cardholders to continue to support spending activity on the predominantly general purpose MasterCard portfolio, but that would be period expenses more so than any individual initial impact.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Because -- and you're facing these customers obviously directly and if I recall correctly the renegotiation that you did earlier this year with Sears gives you a little more flexibility on how you can approach the clients and work with them, is that right?","John Gerspach","Yes, it actually means that we own those portfolios we have the right to own those portfolios. And so we don\u2019t see any impact at all other than the slowing down. I would say that\u2019s in the Chapter 11, you also asked I think about Chapter 7. And obviously if for some reason they went down to a full liquidation that would have a larger impact now there would be certain accruals that we would need to take there\u2019d be a write down of the portfolio related intangibles that remains associated with the contract that we have. And so that total impact could be $300 million, that\u2019ll be $300 million charge that we might have to take if they went Chapter 7. ","But most of that charge would reflect the acceleration the write-off of the contract intangible that would otherwise have fully amortize during 2019. So again not a real significant impact to us over the next 15 months.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. And then just one follow-up on the -- I think there was a CCIL question earlier. But, the question I had is I know you put in your commentary went back when you did the Investor Day, potentially a 10% to 20% increase in the reserve at the point in time when CCIL was adopted in 1Q, 2020. The question I have is just the composition of that 10% to 20%, does that include some asset classes where there\u2019s a build in some asset classes where there is release. Just wondering thinking around that. ","John Gerspach","The way that the math works with some of the models, yes, there are some portfolios where upon the adoption of CCIL we\u2019d actually have too much. Loan loss reserve and then there are others that would require us to build some additional reserves. All of that is embedded in that 10% to 20% guidance that we have given you.","And that we also said that as we look at it now it\u2019s likely to be that we\u2019re on the upper end of that guidance. But we\u2019re still within the guidance that we gave.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thank you. ","John Gerspach","No problem, Betsy. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Afternoon. Couple of questions, one on the accrual businesses and ICG you have had lot of success there. But you did see a slowdown in TTS this quarter, I think it grow 4% was down sequentially, any color there what\u2019s going on and what drove that?","John Gerspach","So I\u2019d ask you to focus on the constant dollar disclosure that we gave you with TTS, only because so many of our revenues in TTS come from outside the U.S. And on a constant dollar basis, what we told you is that the TTS revenues grew again by 8% this quarter year-over-year. So we think that\u2019s been consistent with that the growth that you have seen in the past. So, we don\u2019t see any real slowdown in our TTS business at all.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So it\u2019s just currency then.","John Gerspach","Correct, sir. ","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on CCIL you highlighted the estimate. But, I think perhaps the bigger impact for you and for some of the money centers or GSIBs is the interplay with the CCAR process and interplay with the SCB. But just any comments there, any concerns about whether that CCIL\u2019s implementation into CCAR could serve as an impediment to your capital optimization plan.","John Gerspach","Well, there\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about the future of CCAR and CCIL, but the one thing we do know is that the Fed has said that CCIL will not be part of the 2019 CCAR cycle. So, therefore we\u2019re not anticipating that CCIL will have any impact on our ability to again our guidance is that we expect to be able to achieve that $60 billion worth of capital return over those three CCAR cycles we have done $41 billion through the first two cycles that we referenced. And we don\u2019t see CCIL as an impediment to us completing that.","Mike Corbat","And the other thing we have done is we\u2019ve tried to emphasize with the Fed that they should be actually taking a aggregated view of the combinations of whatever is to come, whenever it comes in terms of SCB, countercyclical buffer and CCIL together to get an aggregate or cumulative view of what impact that may have not just on us but on the industry.","John Gerspach","GSIB, recalibration.","Mike Corbat","Exactly.","Saul Martinez","Got it. I guess, yes, I meant more beyond 2019 to sort of your longer term capital plan, but okay. But that's helpful. Thanks so much.","John Gerspach","Okay. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. ","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning or good afternoon guys. ","John Gerspach","Hey, Gerard. ","Gerard Cassidy","Mike, I think in your opening comments you mentioned that you felt pretty good about the investment banking pipeline and upcoming transactions. Can you compare to us the outlook for that pipeline today for the fourth quarter to what you saw at the end of the second quarter of going into the third quarter is it higher than that, the same, lower?","Mike Corbat","One is there is obviously seasonality to the pipeline kind of depending. So when you look at the numbers today and John referenced it a bit that in there. So we actually had relatively speaking fairly strong performance in terms of M&A. And we actually had relatively weaker performance in terms of the two capital markets debt and equities. And when you look at aggregate these in the third quarter as an example you're in a deal or you're out of a deal that can move the numbers. ","And so traditionally when we look at as we go into year-end, at least traditionally, the combination of M&A deals getting closed is fairly strong. And then people trying to get in particular prefunding or financings done as we close out the year. So our expectation of what I would say I'm not going to get into specific numbers. But I think John in and what he talked about in the 4Q in terms of investment banking, we expect both a sequential and year-over-year increase in there says that we think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility to monetizing a fairly strong pipeline.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And John you talked about in the ICG Group with the equity markets some of the factors that affected the growth in revenues. And you mentioned that there was a challenging trading environment and lower commissions. Can you give us any color on the Midfit 2 [ph] how that might be affecting your cash business and can you make any conclusions yet on which way that's going?","John Gerspach","Yes, really we don't really see much of an impact coming from Midfit 2 [ph] on our equity business at all. What we had here Gerard, if you take a look at our equities overall business, we had good growth in derivatives, in prime finance and delta one. Those products combined were up about 15%, 16% year-over-year. And so where we did see this decline was in cash equity. And we just had-- we just didn't do as good a job navigating the choppy trading environment in cash and equities as we did on the other side of the house in G10 rates and currencies. It's choppy trading environment, we did really well in one set of products and not so well in the other.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just finally, you mentioned in the ICG Group the corporate lending business revenues were up nicely double-digits year-over-year, year-to-date I think they are up almost 17%. Is that coming from what type of corporate loans because I noticed the corporate loans year-over-year when you break it out in slide 21 of the supplement the Private Bank part is up strong as well as the Markets and Securities Services. So where you getting that growth, is it from your large corporate clients or is it from other areas?","John Gerspach","It's pretty widespread Gerard to be honest with you. And it's pretty widespread both on a geographic basis as well as on a product basis. I\u2019d say the one area where we didn't see significant loan growth this quarter would have been in trade. And that's just because we deliberately took down our trade loan book in Asia we just didn't like the spreads. And so we went a little bit more on a originate to distribute mode in Asia.","And the nice thing is with the franchise that we\u2019ve built we've got that ability now to moving aside to participate in the market and hold the loan, because we think that it's a good spread. Or if the spreads are a little bit tighter than we like we can originate and then find other people that we can distribute to.","So I like the overall strength of the franchise right now. It's broad based, it really is getting deeper in with the clients. And I think that's reflected in the loan growth that you've been seeing in both, in all the regions of ICG.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","John Gerspach","No problem.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","John Gerspach","Hey, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hey, thanks. Just two quick questions here, one just focusing on the non-interest revenues in North America for GCB, I mean, those were down again quarter-on-quarter and it's probably like the lowest it's been 10 years. I mean, you mentioned that there were some higher partner payments, some additional partner terms going through there, but we're kind of hitting a low water mark for that. And if we should inflict from here?","John Gerspach","Yes, Brian, it's a noisy line, especially this year. I'll grant you that. Don't forget earlier in the year we had some gains that we told you about on the Visa B shares that is influencing that line. We also did mention the fact that we had some higher partnership terms that kicked in with some of our portfolios and that's going through that line. I think you're going to see improved growth on that line when we get into next year, and we get beyond some of these one-off transactions.","If you look at Citi overall right now, and you look at our net interest revenue and fees, net interest revenues constitute just over 60% of our revenues, 62%, 63% something like that. Whereas fees are 37%, 38% and there's just a lot of noise going on in the fee line right now between the gain that we took last year with yield book, the gain now that we're taking with the asset management the partnership fees that are rolling in.","But what we really think that as we move forward, you're going to see additional fee generation especially in GCB, the interchange, the annual fees as we get beyond those partner payments, they will come through. So I think on a go forward basis, you can think about growth and non-interest revenues for Citi as being at a slightly higher pace than interest revenue.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great. And then just one separate question on the legacy assets, the North American consumer looks like the pace of run-off have kind of slowed modestly, but I mean, how should we think about that going forward, I know you gave some of the guidance that it's going to be an offset?","John Gerspach","The run-off of legacy assets, that is absolutely slowing because we have less legacy assets to run-off. And, legacy assets now are roughly 1% of our overall GAAP balance sheet. So once we got past our Columbia consumer business, which we managed to sell earlier this year, there are really no more operating businesses in there. It's really comprised of some of the legacy mortgages and home equity loans. So they'll continue to run-off but at a slower pace.","What you will continue to see for at least the next year is some impact on the expense line of the run-off, because don't forget, as we sell these businesses, in many cases we've entered into these transactions supportive release where we continue to support the business for a period of time could be 12 to 24 months as the buyer is integrating these operations into their own operation. So we still expect some benefit coming from the rundown of legacy assets on the expense line. But you're absolutely right, you're going to see less of an impact in assets.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, great. Thanks. ","John Gerspach","Okay. No problem, Brian.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Susan Kendall","Great. Thank you all for joining us here today.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.","Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $1.87 are up 11% from a year ago. We continued to make progress against our financial targets and strategic priorities; first, in regards to improving our return on capital, our return on tangible common equity rose to 11.9% up 50 basis points from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the tenth straight quarter and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses.","In our global consumer bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region, excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses. We grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remain broadly in line with our expectations driving double digit EBIT growth.","In North America, we saw strong underlying growth of 5% in our Branded Cards portfolio, and 3% growth in retail services. We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to support our branch light digital heavy strategy in the U.S.","In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth, and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year, investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid. Our institutional clients group also performed well. In our steady accrual type businesses such as Treasury and Trade solutions and Security Services, overall revenues were up 7% in constant dollars. We also had a 20% increase in investment banking where we have steadily been gaining share among our target clients.","Fixed income did rebound from the fourth quarter with modest year-over-year growth while equities was impacted by a weaker environment. We continued to execute against our second goal in regards to returning -- to improving the return of capital to our shareholders.","During the quarter, we returned over $5 billion in the form of buybacks and dividends. We repurchased 66 million common shares in the quarter, and have reduced our shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago.","We believe, we're on track to reach the commitment we made at investor day of returning at least 60 billion to our shareholders over the three CCAR cycles ending next year subject of course to regulatory approval. We recently completed our 2018, 2019 CCAR submission to the Federal Reserve, which is the third tranche of that commitment.","When we entered the year, we talked about the need for us to be flexible to meet a range of operating environments, given the way 2018 ended. We have multiple leverage at our disposal, including expenses, balance sheet and continued credit discipline. I think we use them correctly, and now the environment seems to be normalizing. While GDP growth does appear to be slowing somewhat, we still see good consumer and corporate engagement. We'll continue to focus on serving our clients and finding opportunities to deepen our relationships across our consumer and institutional businesses and we remain committed to executing our strategy and to meeting our financial targets.","As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench, and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who helped drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement. After, Ybarra, Carey Lathrop, Andy Morton, Mary McNiff, and Jessica Russ [ph] all have decades of experience at our firm. I also think the change at the top is healthy and creates opportunities to do things differently and shows that we take our talent and succession planning seriously.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark, then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark?","Mark Mason","Thank you Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses, and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues as well as higher credit costs.","EPS grew 11% including the impact of a 9% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.","Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues, and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate\/Other.","Expenses declined by 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning while overall credit quality remained stable.","Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter and RoTCE improved to 11.9%. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, below our full year outlook reflecting a discrete item related to tax reform, as well as a small benefit associated with stock based incentive compensation. The lower tax rate resulted in a benefit of about $0.04 per share this quarter.","We expect to be closer to our 23% tax rate outlook for the remainder of the year. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $682 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by wind down -- by the wind down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% to over $1 trillion.","Turning now to each business, Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer banking in constant dollars. Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat; resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%.","Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year, excluding the Hilton gain. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 1% year-over-year.","Mortgage revenues stabilized sequentially, but declined again year-over-year mostly reflecting lower origination activity, and higher funding costs. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 2% driven by modest deposit growth and spread expansion.","Average deposits increased 1% year-over-year reflecting growth in both brands based deposits as well as through digital channels. And looking at deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew balance of 3% from last year, excluding the impact of market movements.","Turning to Branded Cards; revenues grew 5% excluding the Hilton gain. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7% year-over-year excluding Hilton. And we continued to generate growth in interest earning balance this quarter, up about 9% year-over-year. This growth and interest earning balances drove an improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans for NIR percent to 912 basis points this quarter.","Looking forward, the NIR percent should decline seasonally from the first quarter to the second quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect spreads to remain at a level similar to, or perhaps slightly higher than the fourth quarter of last year.","Average loan growth of 1% was somewhat muted this quarter, but I would note that the first quarter of 2018 represented the peak level of promotional balances last year. Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning, to non-interest earning balances, while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter.","Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3% driven by organic loan growth, as well as the impact of the L.L. Bean portfolio acquisition. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 1% year-over-year as higher volume related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.","We continue to drive transaction volumes for lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with 12% growth in mobile users year-over-year. Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 10% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth, and seasoning in both CCAR's portfolios.","Consistent with the pattern seen in prior years, we expect card NCL rates in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half of the year. Our NCL rate and U.S. Branded Cards was 326 basis points in the first quarter in line with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points to 325 basis points.","And in retail services, our NCL rate was 536 basis points, which is also consistent with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 500 basis points to 525 basis points. During the quarter, we continue to enhance our digital capabilities and launch new products to lay the foundation for a more integrated multi product relationship model. We simplified our deposit account opening process for both new customers, and existing cardholders, and at the same time successfully launched a new digital savings product, targeted to cut to customers outside our core retail markets.","Looking across all deposit products, we have already been -- we have already seen digital deposit sales in the first quarter of 2019 that are roughly equal to all of last year. More than two thirds of the new accounts from digital channels are new to our retail banks and more than half or outside of our branch footprint.","We also launched a new digital lending product, Flex loan that allows eligible cardholders to convert a portion of their credit line into a fixed rate personal loan, leveraging our experience in Asia. And we will continue to launch new products and relationship based offers in the second quarter, that leverage our proprietary ThankYou and Double Cash rewards, across both card and deposit products. This will also initially be targeted to eligible card customers outside our core retail markets. So while many of these initiatives are still new, we feel good about our progress today.","On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 3%. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 6% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year. The impact was a net benefit in the first quarter as we recorded a small residual gain on the sale, partially offset by the absence of related revenues.","Retail loan growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, driven by a slowdown in activity in our commercial banking franchise, where client sentiment has become more cautious under the new administration. While consumer confidence remains quite strong in Mexico this quarter, we have begun to see a slowdown in GDP growth and overall industry lending volumes. And while a slowdown in GDP is not unusual in a post-election year, we are watching the economy closely.","Importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen this quarter in our strong EBIT growth.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues. While investment revenues remained under pressure in the first quarter, we continued to see positive flow into assets under management, as well as 10% year-over-year growth in Citigold clients. And our revenue comparisons should become easier from here as investment revenues peak last year in the first quarter.","Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium term expectations. In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume driven growth. And cost of credit declined 4% reflecting a modest reserve release this quarter compared to a modest build in the prior year.","Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remains broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable delinquency trends across regions. In North America, the NCL rate increased sequentially, mostly reflecting seasonality in parts. And in Mexico, the NCL rate reflects continued seasoning in the cards portfolio as well as the impact of lower overall volume growth.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter, as strengthened TTS and investment banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened throughout the quarter.","Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 8%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported, and 10% in constant dollars reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit and trade spreads.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 20% from last year, outperforming the market wallet driven by strength in M&A and investment grade debt underwriting.","Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower managed investment revenues as well as higher funding cost, and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9% reflecting growth in volumes and spreads.","Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion declined 6% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strengthened rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable.","Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances. And finally, in securities services, revenues were flat on a reported basis but up 5% in constant dollars driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.","Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion decline 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by loan specific reserve releases.","Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points. And the addition to non-accrual this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit as these loans were covered by previously established reserves.","Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $431 million declined 27% from last year, and expenses were down 26% mostly reflecting the wind down of legacy assets. And the pre-tax loss was $93 million this quarter, in line with our outlook.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect a modest pre-tax quarterly loss in Corporate\/Other for the remainder of 2019.","Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.","These results included a modest drag from the lower trading related, net interest revenue and the continued wind down of legacy assets. As we had anticipated, the drag from these items was far less material this quarter than it had been a year ago. And in total, these revenues now comprise less than 5% of our total net interest revenue. Therefore, we believe it is most relevant to look at our net interest revenue and net interest margin trends on a consolidated basis going forward.","On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $240 million reflecting two fewer days in the quarter. And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix.","On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth and net interest revenue year-over-year. We are no longer assuming a midyear rate increase in 2019, but the expected benefit from the rate hike had been relatively small at less than $100 million of incremental revenue.","In the first quarter, the year-over-year growth in net interest revenue was more than offset by a decline in non-interest revenue. However, this decline in non-interest revenue was mostly driven by the $150 million Hilton gain in the prior year, a $250 million year-over-year drag from the mark-to-market losses on loan hedges and the comparison to a very strong prior year in equities.","We also saw a small residual drag on non-interest revenue from the wind down of legacy assets, but less than we've seen in prior years.","On a full year basis, we continue to expect total non-interest revenue to come in at least flat to the prior year. On Slide 11, we show our key capital metrics. In the first quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 7% year-over-year to $65.55 driven by lower share count. And our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $5.1 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.","Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook. We continue to prepare for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our full year RoTCE target of 12% for 2019. For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses, and higher but manageable cost of credit, combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth. We face fewer headwinds in areas like Asia consumer, equities and the private bank, which presented difficult comparisons for us this quarter. And the underlying growth in North America consumer should be more evident as we move as we move beyond the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale.","For the second quarter in ICG, in fixed income in equity markets, given the slower start to the year, we do not expect to see the same magnitude of seasonal decline in revenues we typically see from the first quarter to the second quarter. Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but given the strength of our performance in the prior year, we expect to be somewhat down year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our core businesses, across TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.","On the consumer side, in North America we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth with U.S. Branded Cards now on a solid path. In Asia, year-over-year revenue growth should improve as we continue to grow our core businesses and we face less of a headwind from investment revenues.","And in Mexico, year-over-year revenue growth will likely be muted given strong growth and performance in the second quarter of last year, although we expect continued growth in pre-tax earnings.","For total Citigroup, we expect expenses in the second quarter to be roughly flattish to last year. And cost of credit should continue to reflect loan growth and normal portfolio seasoning. In addition, we look forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter.","At Investor Day, we stated our goal of returning at least $60 billion of capital to shareholders as part of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 CCAR process. And subject to regulatory approval, we remain on track to deliver on this goal.","With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.","John McDonald","Good morning, thanks. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the efficiency improvement that you're looking for this quarter. Looks like the efficiency ratio improved 90 basis points year-over-year, but extra helped in look closer to 140 basis points. I guess is that 140 basis points more of what you're looking for this year in terms of efficiency better than you did last year, and what are the key drivers of that?","Mark Mason","Yes. So thank you Don, and good to talk to you. I guess, I'd say we are certainly pleased with the expense levels we were able to deliver against this quarter. We came into the year on the heels of a fourth quarter that was obviously under a lot of revenue pressure. And so we wanted to be thoughtful about managing all the levers that we had in Q1 and in fact that is what we've -- what we've done. For the full year as I mentioned, we are looking for some top line revenue growth for total Citi and expenses that would be roughly flattish to what we'd seen in the prior year. That will obviously result in improved operating efficiency versus last year, but probably equally important, certainly equally important, we are managing those other levers whether it be the cost of credit or capital to ensure that we\u2019re getting to that RoTCE of 12%, and that would stay on our trajectory to get to 13.5 plus in the outer years.","What's involved with that to the other part of your question is continued momentum, continued growth in the accrual businesses that we have that I mentioned earlier, TTS Security Services, Private Bank et cetera, continued strength in our consumer franchise which grew globally at 4% this year, but U.S. Branded Cards ex Hilton grew 5%. We expect that growth to continue, and continue strengthening NIR line percentage for the Branded Cards business. And a continue normalization or stable market more broadly that should hopefully bode well for our markets business. So, those are kind of the drivers on the top line.","On the expense line, we will as mentioned last quarter, see the benefit of our productivity outweigh the investments that we\u2019re making and that should generate another $500 to $600 million over the course of 2019, that will be available to either fund expenses related to volume growth and certainly contribute to the overall performance metrics that we mentioned. And so, those items as well as the results coming out of CCAR and what that means for capital will be important levers that get us to the returns and get us to the results in operating efficiency.","John McDonald","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Just as a follow-up. It looks like the average deposits in North America, consumer showed a pickup in a better trend this quarter. What\u2019s driving that improvement in your view? And could you remind us more broadly of your strategy to grow U.S. retail deposits and why you feel comfortable doing so despite a smaller physical footprint?","Mark Mason","Sure. So, we grew the deposits, U.S. retail deposits by about 1%. We got about $180 billion of deposits, about 30 or so are commercial deposits, the balance are consumer related deposits. We saw a very good growth through our digital channel. So digital generated deposits on the heels of really executing against the strategy that we talked about. And so, we have a relatively small footprint with 689 or so branches. That said, we\u2019ve got access to over 65,000 ATMs, and we\u2019ve got a very very large our U.S. cards portfolio. And our strategy as you know is a client led revenue growth strategy where we are looking to take advantage of the large customer base we have in cards and through enhance digital capabilities offer them value propositions that adhere to what the most responsive to.","And so what we saw in the quarter and this growth with a comb -- and this deposit growth was a combination of getting good traction with our digital platform and with our customers both new to bank customers, but also existing branch customers and with some of our cards customers. We\u2019ll continue to roll out new products in the second quarter. We\u2019ve rolled out Flex loan this quarter. We rollout additional products in the second quarter around ThankYou and Double Cash rewards. I mean, again those will involve value propositions that we think will appeal to our clients in driving broader penetration of their wallets and a deeper customer relationship.","John McDonald","Great. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. So, I think both growth in the consumer side in Mexico and Asia are below where your goals were. It does sound like you felt good about Asia getting better. But I heard your comments on Mexico looking at slower GDP growth and worse loan trend. So, what do you look for there? And more importantly what can you do if the just general macro backdrop in Mexico is little slower. What\u2019s the goal there? Do you power through and grow the underlying franchise or you cut back to manage profitability?","Mike Corbat","I think Glenn, what we\u2019ve talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks is we think we\u2019ve got the ability to manage the cost lines there and to manage both EBIT growth as well as returns. So, I think we\u2019ve talked about some of the investment we've made there. I think we\u2019re starting to see the ability to pull the levers on positive operating leverage and sustainability of that, at the same time through some of the other things, we\u2019ve done optimization et cetera not only drive EBITDA, drive net income, but also drive returns. So I think if we saw growth rates continue to slow a bit, I think we\u2019ve got the ability to manage through that and continue to still get the growth we want there at the bottom line in returns.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And if I could follow-up on John's and your answer on his card question; offering card customers tailored rewards to bring in banking business, happen to be a big fan of that, but I think it's getting a little active where you and a couple other big players are doing that. Can you drill down little bit more of what exactly you\u2019re offering? Is it in motion right now? And is it too early to talk about initial results?","Mike Corbat","Well, I think it\u2019s too early to talk about results, because we\u2019re really kind of just at the stage of launch. But if you think, Glenn, about what we have that makes us a bit unique. I\u2019m going to leave some of our partner, a retail service relationships aside, but we effectively have 28 million people in the United States that carry Citi Plastic in somewhere between ThankYou, Double Cash, a value proposition that clearly people bought into. So as we go into these markets non-core. When we go outside of our six, we don't go in on a de novo basis. We go in already having established Citi customers in those areas.","We know who they are. We know what they spend on. We know who their bank is, right. We\u2019ve seen their payments come in, if it's not us. And we think we've got the ability around our value proposition to target them offers which has the ability -- gives us the ability to compete on something other than rate. So, I think we feel excited about it. You'll see us out in the market in Q2 with that. And so I think it\u2019s early to tell. But the early test and things we've done we\u2019re excited about it.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Good morning.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just, Mark, quick question on rate sensitivity. I think you guys have been much less sensitive to long as the curve both positively or negatively than your peers. Can you kind of I guess two question on that. I guess, could you discuss the risk of a rate cut given your short end sensitivity? And I guess secondly how you think about your positioning here. Is there any opportunities or risks in this \u2013 that the flatter curve is here for a while?","Mark Mason","Sure. So, I guess I\u2019d make a couple of comments. One, just as it relates to what we forecasted for 2019 and I mentioned it in my remarks. In that we had originally forecasted one rate hike of about 25 basis points in the second half of the year. That one rate hike essentially equated to about $100 million of revenue. And so, not a material impact, we\u2019ve taken that out of our forecast now as I sit here and talk to you about the outlook. But not a material impact to the revenue forecast that we have for 2019.","And similarly if there were -- we continued over time to kind of take down our ROE exposure and we certainly have done that and continue to do that through this quarter. If we were to look at a rate cut, we kind of looked at our exposure there and a rate cut would be somewhere around $50 million for the quarter, or $35 million to $50 million for the quarter.","And so, not a material impact of a rate cut either. And so, we feel -- we obviously -- if rate remain flat or a declined for an extended period of time, we obviously will manage and look at the balance sheet very carefully and thoughtfully there. But we feel good about where we stand today as it relates to the rate environment.","Jim Mitchell","Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. And then when we think about your 2 billion plus for the year, I guess what scenario drives the plus. Is it just loan growth or is there some other aspects of the market that can help?","Mark Mason","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s largely one to be loan growth and not a volume we're able to capture there. But we continue to feel very good about the $2 billion NIR forecast that net interest revenue forecast that we talked about. And we think that the continued momentum that we see in Branded Cards and other parts of the portfolio will allow for us to deliver against that, so remain on target for that. We did $860 million in Q1, its roughly 8% more than the prior year and so we feel good about that momentum.","Jim Mitchell","Okay.","Mark Mason","The other component would be mix. So, loan growth and mix would be the other component that would be an important driver there. That is to say consumer versus corporate growth that type of mix.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on Asia consumer accounts both card and retail banking accounts have been -- were pretty flat. Is there an opportunity to grow that from here? What sort of the strategy needed to grow accounts? Or is it just more of a mature mark \u2013 more mature market?","Mark Mason","Yes. I\u2019ll make two points on Asia consumer. One, we did see good growth with our Citigold, customers about 10% growth in Citigold accounts. And then two, we\u2019d see -- we saw a good growth as it relates to investment AUMs adjusted from market movements, so good momentum there as well. And so, we think we\u2019re showing good sign for when that market does return in terms of the broader market activity to capture some of that upside given the account growth and given the investment AUMs we\u2019ve been growing.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the management turnover. I think its three of the top five people that presented at Investor Day have retired. And I\u2019m not looking for a meaningful change in the strategy but are there kind of changes around the edge in terms of execution and just elaborate a bit on not just some of the senior people living in the company?","Mike Corbat","Sure, Matt. I think if you look back and kind of go back through the years, really not just since I've been \u2013 became CEO in 2012, but actually if we go back to the senior leadership levels of the firm there is I think by any standards it\u2019s been pretty remarkable stability. And if you look at the retirements that we announced in the fall or Jamie's retirement, in most cases all 30-year plus veterans not only of the industry but almost in every case, most cases are firm. And so below that as you can imagine we\u2019ve over the years built equally strong and robust bench. And so while I hate to see people move on.","At the same time in Jamie\u2019s case, Jamie is been a terrific partner, friend. If you look at the other success we've had in ICG, he's obviously been the leader of that and I think done a nice job of building that. But I think a lot of the credit also as he would give, goes to the team below in terms of what they've done. So I think in the sense since we\u2019re excited about the people I talked about in my opening remarks of having been at the firm for quite a while and having their shot at putting their fingerprint on the business. And I think if you look at the underlying growth, the market share gains, the customer feedback we get from many of the surveys that obviously goes as great as he is beyond one person in the organization. And so they're excited. We\u2019re excited. I\u2019m excited to have them at my table and the things that we can do to continue to grow the business going forward.","Matt O'Connor","And if I recall correctly, I don't think you appointed a new President and I\u2019m wondering if you do intend to do that and if it would come from someone internally or potentially some of the externally? Thank you.","Mike Corbat","I have no plans to do that as of now.","Matt O'Connor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","So what are your RoTCE an efficiency target for 2019 and 2020? That really just kind of where you\u2019re guiding us. I think consensus is really backed off some of the targets you had last year. So let\u2019s start with RoTCE. You reiterated a 12% target for 2019. That\u2019s clear. And then at the September presentation from last year you said 13.5% for 2020 and Mark today you said the outer years, again consensus does not expect this, but are you still looking for 13.5% for 2020 and if not what do you\u2019re looking for?","Mark Mason","Yes. So let me be clear and I apologize if I misstated something. So, for 2019 the RoTCE target is 12%. For 2020 the RoTCE target is 13.5 plus percent.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Well, there seems like disconnect between consensus than what you're guiding, so I guess there\u2019s some skepticism. And maybe one reason for skepticism is on the efficiency. And I appreciate that efficiency is a means to an end, that is, your goal is to improve the returns, get it. But that September presentation last year, you highlighted efficiency improving from 57% in 2018 to 53% in 2020 with a 175 basis point improvement in 2019 and 225 basis point improvement in 2020, and you might pull back a little bit from that on the fourth quarter earnings, I\u2019m not sure, but what is your efficiency target now for the firm? And if you can give any color on GCB and ICT, that would be great too?","Mike Corbat","So, I\u2019ll make a couple of statements. One is longer-term we're still remain committed to getting to the low 50s from an operating efficiency point of view. We believe the investments that we\u2019ve made, the productivity that we\u2019re expecting will allow for us to get that -- to get there over time. The target that you referenced for 2019 and 2020 are certainly target that we have and that we\u2019ve said and constructed the plans based on presented those.","I will tell you as you witnessed at the heel -- on the heels of 2018, and frankly as we continue to go through the balance of 2019 that we\u2019re going to pull whatever levers we need to pull to get to the return targets that we set. While at the same time trying to protect investments that are critically important to the growth of the franchise, and that's an important -- that's an important trade-off that that we have to do, that we have to make and we've done it in the past, we did it in Q4 and we\u2019ll continue to do it.","So, I'm not moving away from those targets. What I'm doing is I'm recognizing and hopefully others are recognizing that their multiple levers that can be pulled, that we\u2019ve got a long-term objective of delivering shareholder value and we don't want to make short-term decisions that compromise our ability to do that.","Mike Mayo","So, with a chance to kind of clear the deck a little bit, so -- again consensus does not assume you're going to get that 53% efficiency ratio next year. You talked about not relying on one additional rate increase. You want to protect the critical investments. So, do you want to give us any guidance for efficiency improvement in 2019 and 2020?","Mark Mason","Yes. I\u2019m not giving any additional guidance at this point in time beyond what\u2019s out there.","Mike Mayo","And then my follow-up \u2013 that\u2019s fine. I understood. And then my follow-up, Mike, back in 2013 you gave a target to improve the ROA to 90 to 110 basis points. And I think if you adjust for taxes you still might not be in that range. So I think some of the frustration reflect in the valuation and the stock is some missed financial target. Can you give some sort of context to the missed financial target whether that one or some of the efficiency guidance that was given over the last few years. Why they weren\u2019t met and why you can maybe make your targets now at least for RoTCE? Thanks. That's my last question.","Mark Mason","Sure. So Mike on the ROA, we\u2019ve talked about this on these calls in different forms before and that is if you look at what's happened from a capital perspective and a capital optimization perspective, our binding constraint today and probably has been for a bit and will likely to be into the future is around standardized stressed based capital. And what we\u2019ve talked about from a balance sheet or from an RWA optimization is making sure that we\u2019re using the balance sheet in a way that is accretive to our shareholders. And so, the example I gave which remains the case today and I think witness in our numbers for the quarter that we had outperformance in terms of our rates and in terms of our spread product.","Those are accretive businesses to our shareholders. And rather than choose to optimize our balance sheet simply based on a blunt number of assets -- of the assets over earnings to actually look at the capital and the optimization of return and that's what we've done. And I think we\u2019ve talked about that. We tried to be transparent with that. I think in the numbers you see in terms of RWA usage and allocation we\u2019ve tried to stay mindful to that which we think is clearly the best outcome.","Mike Mayo","Can I squeeze one last short question?","Mark Mason","Sure.","Mike Mayo","Without the efficiently target do you think you can comment to show better efficiency this year next in each region in GCB as you showed at this quarter and the ICG? Is that too much of an ask or is that something that's achievable?","Mike Corbat","I think it's achievable. I'm not going to commit here because again I don't know what the environment brings, and simply rather say that we\u2019re committing to positive operating leverage in every region, every business, I would just go back to Mark's point that we understand how it plays in the math. We\u2019re committed to getting the company into the low 50s. I think as you\u2019ve seen our ability to drive leading performance in terms of operating efficiency, but if it comes down to the choice of not being able to make an investment in an area that we view as critical or accretive or something its offering real opportunity versus hitting the target I think our shareholders have been very clear certainly to me and to Mark that they would want us to make that investment. So, here Mike, I won't commit to that.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hey, guys. Good morning. I want to follow up on the RoTCE question. Obviously the Street is well below your guidance for this year and especially for 2020. And I'm sure you look at analyst estimates and your IR team looks at analyst estimates in terms of where they're at. I mean, where do you think there is the most go for outperformance? Where do you guys differ you think in terms of what your expectations are versus where you think Street is?","Mark Mason","Yes. There\u2019s some difference as it relates to revenue. There\u2019s some revenue difference. There\u2019s some cost-to-credit difference when you kind of look at analyst expectations versus where we are. We -- our cost-to-credit estimates are lower than that of the Street. And then obviously we have read 11.9 of a CET1 ratio going down to the 11.5 at the end of the year. And so what we do with capital is another assumption that\u2019s in there. I think the tax rate certainly, we came in lower this quarter, but we talked about that being at about 23% for the full year. So most of the differential I think is going to be a little bit on the top line in the cost-to-credit as well. And then the rest of it I think is pretty much there. We talked about plans, expense which I think people have fixed upon.","Saul Martinez","Yes. So there\u2019s a little bit on the revenue side and you\u2019re building in a lot less normalization in terms of credit cost than maybe one must have?","Mark Mason","I kind of feel like we're looking at a normalized view of it.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. If I could change gears then on retail banking earnings, income from continuing operation this quarter I believe was 80 \u2013 in the 80 something million this quarter. You\u2019re far below what its been in the recent past. And I guess a couple questions. First, is there anything idiosyncratic in that number? And two, I get that you\u2019ve highlighted some of the new initiatives and that builds [ph] will take time to kind of play out in filtering the numbers. But any sense of when you start to -- when you think that'll start to actually filter into the results and you'll start to see better results in retail banking?","Mike Corbat","So, retail banking for North America, we started to see I think some good growth this quarter particularly if you exclude mortgages. So, we think that that will continue to play out. As I mentioned we\u2019re seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in particular in the way of expenses except, what I would say is that the productivity that we\u2019ve talked about is going to start and will continue to play out through the balance of the year, and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the retail banking profitability in the outer quarters.","On that we start to see the productivity, savings outweigh, the investments that we've been making across that franch or that piece of the franchise. So combination of continued revenue growth, continued expense improvement on the heels of productivity saves should help drive improved performance there.","Saul Martinez","Was there anything unusual in the line item this quarter? The 83 million of operating earnings is been running about 130 to 160 in recent quarters? Or is that just \u2013 was it just the tough quarter?","Mark Mason","Not that I can -- well, we made \u2013 we\u2019ve talk about the investments that we\u2019ve been making. So we \u2013 the digital investments that we\u2019ve been making in the platform, I mean, those are things that would be playing out through Q1, and again, somewhat back loaded in terms of the productivity save that start to play out in the balance of the year.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Mark Mason","I guess the other think I\u2019d mentioned is and I mentioned this at our conference I did in March which is that, as we came into the year and again on the heels of the fourth quarter what we saw material softness in revenue, we wanted to be very thoughtful about the 2019 plans and we did take an opportunity in Q1 to pull forward some of our restructuring decisions if you will, or reorganization decisions. And so, while we don't break the item out, there\u2019s probably some repositioning dollars inside Q1 for retail banking in particular that is driving that 83 that you see in the quarter. Again, you'll see the benefits of that start to play out in outer quarter, so the investments and some repo spending.","Saul Martinez","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Mark, just a follow-up there. You had a really good start year-over-year on the expense side. And then you mentioning flattish on the second quarter which should be up a touch from the first even though history which show first quarter often is the peak for the year just given the way you guys accrue in the institutional businesses. So, could you just talk through, is it perhaps just more of a better aspiration on the revenue side. Why don\u2019t you expect flat year-over-year given the point you just made about having perhaps a little restructuring under there and then the better start already that you had in the first quarter of the year?","Mark Mason","Yes. So, to be clear we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year, and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that. We still expect that the absolute dollar of expenses will be higher in the first half versus the second half of 2019, but on a year-over-year basis you could see some growth in the second half resulting in an aggregate 2018 to 2019 that\u2019s flattish on the expenses.","Ken Usdin","Okay, Got it. And on credit you talked about being inside the bands for your expected card losses and also that first half will similarly also be higher than second there. Just want to ask you anything you're seeing in the consumer side outside of normal seasoning that would change your views one way or the other as far as credit card specifically and loss trajectories going forward? Thanks.","Mike Corbat","Sure. No. there\u2019s nothing. We look at a whole host of metrics as you would imagine whether it stays delinquent or NIM pay and all of those important metrics and we\u2019re not seeing any signs of significant concern or a concern as it relates to the portfolio. You referenced exactly what I think the numbers reflect which is seasoning that and seasonality that\u2019s kind of playing out even when you look at the chart on slide seven that if you look at North America that bump on the 260 to the 297, one, there\u2019s a single name kind of commercial credit in there that\u2019s driving probably four basis points and the rest is really just tied to the seasonality that you can see in prior year quarters, even in Latin America, its less of a of an increase in NCL dollars and more a byproduct of lower volumes and the denominator there. And so, the answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing any particular signs around consumer or credit concerns and I extrapolate that to more broadly to suggest that is the case for institutional as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, Good morning.","Mike Corbat","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I wanted to touch base on an announcement that you made at the end of March that had to deal with Citi building out digital consumer payments platform. And I know we talked earlier in the call about the issuer side, but I think this is more on the merchant side. And then I just want to understand what your expectations are for the TAM that you're looking at? What your market share improvement is? Do you think you can get with this over time? And do you feel that this would also bleed into opportunity on issuance as you deliver more services to your clients, maybe just spent a little time on that? Thanks.","Mark Mason","Sure. So I think if you look at what's going on in the payment space, I think we\u2019ve seen a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot more engagement from our business customers of wanting to create a direct C2B channel. And so, I think some people look at this different ways to different merchant acquiring models. But I think the way they we\u2019re set up and we work closely with MasterCard and others is really kind of create that channel where our consumers have the ability directly through our pipes to create payments in there and I think in some ways that play to our strength that plays a little bit to our uniqueness of the things that we do. And so we\u2019re excited about that. I think if you look at the pace of payments that\u2019s kind of going in that direction, obviously picking up.","And I think importantly both the business expectation and the consumer expectation is that that channel if it doesn't exist needs to exist. So, early stages, but again based on the on the pipes and the things we've had both in the consumer side as well as from the ICG side we think we\u2019ve got the connectivity. And I think unlike others we\u2019re actually leading this from the ICG or the TTS side in our firm.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Maybe we could broaden it out a little bit to talk about the B2B platform that you\u2019re working on as well the cross-border payments in general or we\u2019re hearing from some other institutions as well that there is a lot of interest in developing direct merchant-to-merchant or corporate-to-corporate B2B payment cross-border at T and I'm wondering where you are with your offering there and is it something that you focus on building out or not?","Mark Mason","Well, I would start out, Betsy, I think that\u2019s a business were in, right, that\u2019s when you look at our TTS business historically the TTS portion of that has been predominantly has been B2B. We\u2019ve seen the growth rates that we\u2019ve had there. I think you\u2019ve seen this kind of not only operating with Fortune 5000 to Fortune 5000 but also working down and what John would historically kind of talk about what TTS is in terms of treasury management supply chain, cash, working capital, I think all of those. And so I think that's what you describe is the area where I think we've seen a lot of our penetration and growth coming from over the past couple years and it's obviously, an area that we\u2019re continue to stay focused on.","Operator","Your next is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Mark, in terms of the guidance for growth for NIR, is it based off of the 46 million in NIR that you presented in slide 10. I\u2019m just remembering from previous quarter that you talked about core accrual net interest revenue which would be I think based on the fourth quarter slides, a base of 44 billion?","Mark Mason","Yes. The 2 billion was based on total NIR.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Mark Mason","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning.","Mark Mason","Hi, Steven.","Steven Chubak","So, I wanted to start off with the question on the capital targets. You noted the commitment to achieving the RoTCE goals for 2019 and 2020s, so that certainly quite encouraging. I was hoping if you can remind us just what the underlying CET1 or capital target that's contemplated as part of those goals. And maybe any update in terms of the sensitivity to those goals? Have capital targets have actually increased under the SCB?","Mark Mason","Sure. So again our goal or our target I should say from CET1 ratio point of view is 11.5% and that 11.5% is comprised of CET1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%. We have a GSIB surcharge of about 3% and we have an estimate for SCB of about 3% as well. And then as a management buffer that we\u2019ve added in there of 1% which is really designed to cover variability in various elements of the capital requirements.","So that gets us to the 11.5%. We\u2019ve obviously been running at 11.9% in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter.","The fourth quarter will inform what we\u2019re able to request and therefore hopefully get approved from a regulatory CCAR point of view. But that gives us another 40 basis points above our target to absorb a worse scenario if that were the case or to request more capital, should that be an opportunity that we that we deem or think make sense. I think as it relates to -- there really is a lot of new information as it relates to the SCB proposal. And so I think the last that's been out there from a news point of view has been in 2020. We get some guidance for 2020. We don't have any additional guidance or direction around that.","What's going to drive our ability to return capital in the future will be the combination of how much net income we\u2019re able to generate to common. The utilization of our DTA, or disallowed DTA, today our disallowed DTA is about $11 billion. We've been using somewhere between 1 billion and 1.3 billion on an annual basis. I\u2019d expect that it still be the case. So the combination of those two things combined with what we're seeing in the way of growth in our business and\/or opportunities that we think makes sense to invest will get us to kind of a core number in terms of what would be available for us to return to shareholders. And so we think we\u2019re well positioned with the 11.5% and we've made our submission and we\u2019re looking forward to regulatory approval sometime in the second quarter \u2013 at the end of the second quarter.","Steven Chubak","Thanks Mark for all that. Helpful color there. And then just one follow-up from me on CECL, at 2017 Investor Day you guided to $1.5 billion to $2 billion pretax impact. You\u2019re quite brave being so early in giving that guidance. I\u2019m wondering now that we have better visibility into the accounting rule as whether you can give us updated targets on the CECL reserve impact. Whether you're still comfortable with that initial guidance of 1.5 to 2?","Mark Mason","Sure. Thank you. So you\u2019re absolutely right. We have previously indicated that we expect the impact of CECL versus our current reserves to be on the upper end of the 10% to 20% range. We have been as you would imagine spending a lot of \u2013 we been spending a lot of time on finalizing our CECL models, working through assumptions, in many instances receiving clarification from regulators and other standard setters. And at this stage we believe the outcome could be a little bit higher than that range, so potentially 20% to 30% primarily driven by credit cards. But keep in mind even if or even at a 30% level the incremental impact to regulatory capital is manageable. So that be left in about 30 basis points of CET1 capital and then in addition we benefit from the regulatory capital phasing over four years.","Steven Chubak","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark.","Mark Mason","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning Mark and good morning Mike.","Mike Corbat","Good morning.","Mark Mason","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Mark, can you share with us, you just gave us a good detail of the amount of money that may be available each year to give back to shareholders through net income as well as the DTA. How much of net income do you guys think you're going to need to support the organic growth of the organization on a go-forward basis?","Mark Mason","How much -- how much net income?","Gerard Cassidy","Yes. How much of the \u2013 if we assume that you could theoretically give back 100% of income every year, but obviously you want to support your growth and you're going to need to retain some of it. Do you have an idea of how much of it you would need to keep each year to support that organic growth?","Mark Mason","Yes. So I mean, look obviously since we've been running at CET1 ratios going back as high as 12% or so, we've been able to return more capital and have a payout ratio that was north of the -- north of what the net income is that we've been able to generate. I would imagine as we get closer to the 11.5% and considering your point around investing in the business through either balance sheet, which would impact the RWA or the expense line itself. I would still imagine we'd have a payout ratio that was considerably high. It wouldn't be 100% but it'd likely be consistent with what we see with peers in the industry.","So I'm not -- I'm not prepared to give you an actual percentage payout ratio post 2020, but I'd say it'd be pretty high, and certainly consistent with what peers are paying out.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then circling back up on CECL into your comments that you just made, do you guys think you'll give to us the investors by the end of the year some color on what the -- everyone has been very good at the day one reserve build, which you just gave us or built refined for us today. But any thoughts about what the day two, the loan loss provision number could look like on a quarterly basis going forward versus what you're going to report in 2019 under the old methodology?","Mike Corbat","Yes. So I guess what I'd say to that is, we if you think about our plan if you will, our forecast and what's out there, from an adoption of CECL point of view, we've contemplated that in our 2020 plan and the return targets. And while we continue to refine the analysis around CECL and an impact, we don't we don't expect a material impact on our EBIT or our returns.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of our Al Alevizakos with HBC.","Al Alevizakos","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. It's regarding the fixed income performance. I just was surprised by it because it was too strong. I think given the market backdrop. I just wanted to get a bit of clarity between the different regions what kind of performance did you see in the U.S. versus Asia or Europe? Thank you.","Mike Corbat","Yes. So our fixed income revenues grew 1% versus the prior year. And you know what we really saw was a normalization of rate in credit markets at the turn of the year coming out of the fourth quarter and the dislocation that was there within fixed income results. Our G10 rate outperformed, driven really by strong client activity in North America. We did see a pickup in or an uptick I should say in corporate hedging deals on the back of strong DCM activity.","And in EMEA, the results included increased revenue on structured note issuances as well as investors kind of sought out additional yield. This was offset by the weakness I mentioned earlier in FX given the declining currency volatility. But, as you mentioned, strong perform -- or solid performance I should say in fixed income also aided by solid results and spread products with strong performance in the flow credit products, and we also had a strong quarter in commodities particularly in EMEA driven by good client activity in oils and metals.","Al Alevizakos","Great.","Mike Corbat","A good mix of North America performance and EMEA performance.","Al Alevizakos","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Susan Kendall","Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And if you have any follow up questions, please feel free to reach out to investor relations.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.","We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized different tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant repositioning charge.","In our institutional businesses, market sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and investment banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues.","Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom-line results remained lower due to the investments we are making in that business. Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted segments.","Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S., Mexico and Asia, and we see real path for growing our franchise. We\u2019ve been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we are allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns.","In the last three years, we have exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally.","We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. Repositioning is part of our effort to make share Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We have identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers which now host more than half of our people. That will drive an additional reduction of headcount which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO.","We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from one year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn\u2019t done with Holdings assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won\u2019t report Holdings results -- we won\u2019t report Holdings separately after this year. And being able to do, this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets.","The wind down of Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and it\u2019s been a long time goal. We said, we take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren\u2019t meaningful enough to merit separate reporting and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Another area we\u2019ve focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DTAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%.","We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million in common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under a 100 million over the last four quarters. Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan.","And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our capital planning process as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions have allowed us to make a strong submission.","While 2016 didn\u2019t get off to the start we\u2019d hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still right with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we\u2019ve shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we\u2019ll reduce it, while still serving our clients. We think certain sectors are showing science of weakness, we\u2019ll manage our exposures even more tightly.","John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA\/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed B\u2019s new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi\u2019s own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So, we longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA\/DVA.","On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and investment banking, a continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9% including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.","On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by capital markets related businesses, fixed income, equities, investment banking and Asia Wealth Management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards.","Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the benefit from FX translation. And cost and credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and rates, both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year.","Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter, mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter and in the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we\u2019ll report Citi Holdings as a separate segment.","Turning now to each business, on Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, international consumer banking revenues decline 2% year-over-year. And Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2% as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market.","Turning to Asia, consumer revenues decline 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in card, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment.","In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments, primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rates improved to 1.6%.","On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn\u2019t see the typical rebound in transaction activity and therefore our wealth management revenue declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide with the declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future.","Turning to cards, card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment but payment rates have stabilized and as a result our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle past the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenue. So, while card revenue still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we\u2019re on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year. And credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia.","Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year as continued growth in loans in deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment. So, we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw a year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008.","And turning to retail services, revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of two small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter, as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior to digital channels.","And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly non-investment grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.","On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the cost Costco portfolio.","Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.","So, as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are few things to highlight on Slide 11. First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove a year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third is the impact of regulatory changes in our business particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we\u2019ve achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses, in fact year-over-year the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs.","As we move forward, we believe, we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment.","Turning now to the intuitional clients group on Slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities, and investment banking, total banking revenues of $4 billion excluding the impact of loan hedges declined 6%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads.","Investment banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenue declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period.","Total market and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates in currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities.","Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes in cash equities as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In security services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services businesses. And other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investments in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses were down 1% as higher regulatory in compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation.","On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $150 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2% including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the non-investment grade portion.","We have very little second lien exposure in the corporate portfolio with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly a third of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures in the appendix to our earnings presentation.","As we look at the potential for additional energy and non-energy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full-year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. This is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion with about two-thirds of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio.","If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion of which $2 billion is funded and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations, and year-to-date, we have seen no material draw downs against these facilities.","Turning back to ICG, we saw a significant increase in corporate non-accrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter with roughly $5 billion funded, and we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter.","The increase in non-accrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly two-thirds of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to non-accrual loans this quarter remain performing.","On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG, highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses including treasury and trades solutions, private banks, and security services.","The market environment had a biggest impact on fixed income, equities, and investment banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on low hedges driven by spread movements and of course the higher credit cost in energy.","Turning to the next slide, as I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, corporate lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we\u2019ve deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. Our strategy focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we would be immune to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets and investment banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable, growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted and we\u2019re taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities, and we are remaining disciplined on credit. So, while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through the cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an RoTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment.","Slide 15 shows the results for corporate\/other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.","On Slide 16 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat for the fourth quarter as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings, with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year.","On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics, on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58.","Before we turn it over to questions, I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe investment banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels, if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and transaction services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier.","On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year over year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June.","Turning to Citicorp expenses, there are a few things to consider. First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to payback with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So, even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning cost should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again due to lower revenue assumptions.","While this quarter\u2019s results were disappointing, we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise.","And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Jim Mitchell","Question on energy, I appreciate the update, but that\u2019s a $30 oil or $40 now, obviously that can move. But do you think that if we stay above 40 that the pressure would be a little less should we think but how do we frame I guess oil prices if they remain higher?","John Gerspach","Yes. I think a little bit of that is going to be determined based upon where sentiment plays out. So, clearly when we set up these guidance for year and what we\u2019re looking at is the expectation, let\u2019s say oil in a band of 30 to 35. The oil consistently stays above 40 and especially on a forward curve, you see continued price increases, then yes, the credit costs that I quoted should be somewhat less.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, but not dramatically so, materially higher?","John Gerspach","There will be somewhat less.","Jim Mitchell","Fair enough, and just maybe a follow-up on the Costco acquisition. I appreciate the color on expenses. Should we expect that overall with all the puts and takes to be -- I think you initially were hoping would be modestly accretive, is that still the expectation?","John Gerspach","Very modestly accretive. I mean, I think that\u2019s a net income. I think it\u2019s really going to be roughly flat, Jim. I mean that\u2019s I think the best way to think about it. We\u2019ll generate a buck or two of net income, but really the way to think about it is flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","I just want to make sure I got all the moving parts, and I appreciate all the guidance. I think it\u2019s fair to assume, we\u2019re not going to model loan hedges, the hit that you took this quarter, the write down of Venezuela that happened this quarter. It sounds like with the new guidance, energy reserving could stay about this level, given your past comments to Jim\u2019s question. So, the big deltas from here over the next couple of quarters would be trading gets better and your comments about legal and repositioning being a lot lower. Have I got all the big moving pieces right?","John Gerspach","Yes. And also, don\u2019t forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year, we are going to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. branded cards business as well as the Asia cards business, one as we see those investments begin to really kick-in on the final piece of the puzzle. We\u2019ve gotten new account acquisition, now we\u2019re seeing the receivable balances build, so that revenue growth now should be clearly visible in the latter part of 2016. And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that we\u2019re working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure and therefore we should get growth out of that business. But yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s those things and then the continued growth of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going to be what happens with market sentiment.","Glenn Schorr","Yes. And then, if we could drill down on the comments about markets. Obviously, January and February had a lot thrown at it and we all saw the weakness. Your comments for flattish markets revenues in second quarter, I think a lot of us were thinking like it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s better than where we were in January and February. I\u2019m curious if there is more behind that conservatism besides just that we\u2019re not far out of the woods just yet?","John Gerspach","Well, I think that March was clearly better than January and February. And April is kind of following along March\u2019s path. But I wouldn\u2019t call either March or early April robust, it\u2019s good, better than it was in January and February, but it\u2019s still not a robust market. So, maybe I\u2019m being a bit cautious, but I\u2019d rather be a little cautious and plan that way than say that everything is bounding back and it\u2019s all going to be a great and glorious second quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. Last little one is the proxy came out, I was curious to see the elimination of the ROA target in the outset and go all in on total stockholder return. I think shareholders would like that piece, but I\u2019m curious on what brought the change?","Mike Corbat","Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. Your last comment of shareholders would like what?","Glenn Schorr","The fact that 100% of management\u2019s long-term incentive plan is now driven by total shareholder return, but I was curious on why the drop of the ROA component of it?","Mike Corbat","Well, as John referenced in his comments, we\u2019re not walking away from targets and the disciplines in the firm having change. So John laid out the path of getting to 57 for the remaining three quarters, bringing us in somewhere around 58 in a reasonable environment through the year in firm, so ROA focused and all those. But realistically, we thought we would be transitioning here to much more of a return on equity set of targets; John spoke about some of the targets that we\u2019re putting into the businesses. And at the end of the day, really what you\u2019re looking at is the pathway to how we can get our firm to getting to the returns that you want and expect. And so maybe we were overly simplistic in the plan this year really just focusing on that. Again these plans are year-to-year will continue to take feedback and if that feedback is consistent out there, we\u2019ll think of those things as we go into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","So, just a quick one on the return on tangible outlook that you gave for both GCB and ICG, so, the 20% in GCB, I think you indicated a normal rate environment. Could you maybe give us some color around what normal is, John? And then in ICG, it was a bit more broad than normal. So, if you could maybe just help us understand what you mean by normal in ICG too?","John Gerspach","Well, I\u2019d say that we think in terms of what we consider to be a normal environment. I\u2019d say you\u2019d start with certainly having a U.S. GDP growth something closer to 3% than the 2% that we\u2019re looking at and you certainly would have a higher GDP growth then coming out of the emerging markets. You would expect market sentiment, a little less volatility, less fear, driving improvements in markets as well as investment banking activities and none of that was clearly visible in the first quarter. And I\u2019d say a more conducive rate environment with let\u2019s just say a fed funds rate of about 200 basis points or so higher than where it is today. I think that would be a good start as far as trying to defining a more normal environment. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s beyond the realm of possibility.","Brennan Hawken","And then next one, I am not sure what you can say but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week and some investors pointed the fact that you\u2019ve highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront while certainly that\u2019s not a new goal for you thinking about CCAR right around the corner. Is there anything that you can add on those fronts and on the regulatory front and how those discussions are going?","John Gerspach","I think the results we\u2019ve got in terms of the resolution planning was one where the whole firm came together to submit the plan, and we were obviously very pleased with the outcome. And in many ways, it\u2019s the same way we refocused the firm around our CCAR submissions. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve really tried to build into the fabric of the place. So, our investments that we put forward, we think on the qualitative side hopefully will show themselves. And again in this kind of environment, we\u2019ve been producing lots of capital. And we know we\u2019ve got to be in the position for meaningful capital return and we want to be on that path. So, we think that the submission we put in on CCAR was a strong one and we will see in June the results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","You\u2019ve highlighted your progress, which is good reducing headcount, branches, consumer markets, holdings expenses and DTAs but the ROE, tangible ROE is still only 7%. Now, you did say that the results were disappointing and that you\u2019ll get better returns with a \"more normal environment\u201d, but from my standpoint having covered the -- for a long time, the market\u2019s not buying it. The stocks at 72% of tangible book value looks like this year will be the 10th in a row with returns below the cost of capital and note some large U.S. peers managed to have much higher returns. So, the question is why not do more?","So, the tactical question, which is I think is an easy one, if the efficiency ratio this quarter was 60%, you\u2019re guiding this year for 58%, that implies the next three quarters should be much better than 60%, if you could just clarify why that\u2019s the case. And the tougher one is the strategic question, can\u2019t you accelerate restructuring more than what you\u2019ve already done? You\u2019ve highlighted what you\u2019ve done but with the stock at 72% tangible book value, you should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paperclips in the desk or that the desk chairs or the whole desk to free up capital buyback stock here. And the one area in particular I know we brought it up before, but why not sell Banamex, why not sell the Mexican bank, monetize that gain, use the DTAs to avoid paying taxes, avoid integrating it for Project Rainbow and use the proceeds to buy back stocks? What else can you do? And can you give us a sense of additional urgency because with the 7% ROE and 72% of tangible book value at stock price, it seems like you guys should be doing more?","John Gerspach","Brennan had a two questions limit. Let us start, Mike, maybe I\u2019ll\u2026","Mike Corbat","You go and then I\u2019ll jump in.","John Gerspach","So, let\u2019s talk about efficiency ratio. So, the comments that we made on the 58%, what we said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you followed the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year, that had been our guidance for the full year, tough to recover from the first quarter that we had but we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that again with the outlook that we've put forward by and large we're there. So, that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improve the returns and everything one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital tangible common equity tied up in DTA. It's hard for us and that's impossible for us to get a return on that capital, what we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital even our current business over the last four quarters in the environment that it is whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital excluding that capital tied up in DTA, and that's not making an excuse it's just showing you where we have the issue which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability overtime to return more capital to our shareholder, so that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about.","And there's another element, we'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it is now at the level at it is, we've got still more assets to do, that is capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return, we'll free that capital up, we'll return that capital to the shareholders. So, those are elements of the path forward and then the final is as we have put out we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14% in consumer we told you and we're focused, we're focused on cards and wealth management, we think that that's the right path forward, we think that's the right way to grow revenue, we think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses, we've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that'll really benefit the efficiency ratio as well.","In the ICG we've got a nice base selling in those accrual and transaction services business. 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years, investment banking we feel really good about that franchise, it's a bad quarter, there wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in investment banking and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our fixed income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Even in this environment rates and currencies revenue is up 5% year-over-year and those are good performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year, our real outperformance was in rates, we've got a great franchise in rates and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacities for our products, we're taking care of that and finally we're continuing to make investments in equities, the equities should help us overtime, it did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward Mike, we don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture Mike I don't know if you've got a comment.","Mike Corbat","If it\u2019d help I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise and as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there, and when we look at the business in every sense of the word it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico as an economy is headed we like what we see and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and submission processes. You actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So, it's a good business, it's a growing business, we think it's a strategically important business and simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate term decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","A question you touched on a couple of times, your backlog and investment banking, can you give us a little more color if it is it more North America or is it Asia? And then the second how does it compare to the end of December, has the backlog picked up from there or is about the same?","Mike Corbat","Yes, it's, backlog is up, we have probably got one of our best backlogs we've had in several years and you can think of the markets and just to put in context, yesterday was April 14th and realistically that was the opening of the IPO market here in the U.S. So, as you can imagine there's a fair number of things to do. So, when you think of that M&A, when you think of about the equity calendar, if we can get some kind of reasonable environment, I think could see a lot of transactions coming through the pipe there. From our own perspective I think there's a good balance around the globe, U.S., Europe, Asia in terms of the backlog. So again if we can get any kind of reasonable environment we think we're going to be quite active.","Gerard Cassidy","And then in terms of what's going on in the UK with Britain thinking of leaving the EU, can you guys frame out if that happens what the risks could be to Citigroup?","Mike Corbat","Yes we guess from a Citi perspective but more importantly from a Citi client perspective we think that the EU staying together as it is, is the best outcome, but we'll leave that to the UK voters to decide. From our own perspective as probably you know, we operate in most of the 28 EU countries, and so we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we could do. We run a significant bank out of Ireland, we have trading, we've got people in a number of the countries so we would have options in terms of where we would choose to headquarter a European trading business or where we would put, but clearly around the UK we would still have significant resources there, so we've got contingency planning but we've got a lot of potential options if that's the path it goes down.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just one last question on credit, I know you have given us good detail on energy. In the non-energy area there was some deterioration in credit, granted it wasn't as significant as energy. What type of industries was that deterioration in?","Mike Corbat","I mentioned the fact that some of the non-accrual loan as were in metals and mining. And the rest were small bits in other industries, no particular concentration, and no particular geography that I'm aware of. So it was just sort of spread around.","Gerard Cassidy","And actually it is continuing that, you had nice improvement in charge-offs in the consumer outside the United States. Do you expect that to continue especially in Asia and Latin America?","Mike Corbat","Well we don't see it getting any worse, as we look at the delinquency statistics I mean it's running pretty well, you have a total NCL rate outside the U.S. of 1.6% that's probably close to 70 basis points lower than the loss rate that we have in the U.S. and that's all-in including Mexico. So I don't want to say it's going to get much better, I'm not quite sure how much better it can get but I don't see it getting worse.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Chris Kotowski","Yes looking at the global consumer bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on positive operating leverage and maybe not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we saw that you delivered that in both 2014 and '15, and this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good and then you've got all these moving parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shutdown.","Mike Corbat","Yes.","Chris Kotowski","Can you give us an idea what is kind of the underlying same stores sales operating efficiency or leverage. Is there a positive operating leverage or is it just the card business revenue give ups are too much?","Mike Corbat","It's going to be tough to overcome for this year. Especially with the large amount of repositioning then that we did in the first quarter, so I think it is going to hard to generate that type of story for 2016, but we do think then that again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns, so that's what we're trying to do Chris.","Chris Kotowski","Okay.","Mike Corbat","It is where we are headed.","Chris Kotowski","And then secondly kind of unrelated just if you can say on something like Venezuela where you, I guess you've written a investment there essentially down to zero, is there still an operating business there with optionality in case the situation business, and economic and political situation there ever turns around, or is it just basically more or less shutdown?","Mike Corbat","No, we still have a good business serving our ICG clients that have particularly subsidiaries in that country so there's a -- if the country improves you should see a benefit coming out of that, and you're quite right. With the 180 write down that we took our remaining investment in that country is $4 million so it looks like it\u2019s headed for some really good ROE, if and when the business can come back.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions, just one on the restructuring and the cost this quarter and then the fade in of the 500 million that it's going to drive, so I just want to understand how much of the restructuring came in this quarter and then, I hear you that it will be coming through I just wanted to understand is the 500 million coming entirely through by the end of this year?","John Gerspach","No we\u2019ll get about 400 of that in the last three quarters of the year. So that repositioning that we took in the first quarter largely we repay itself in the 2016 results. And that\u2019s exactly what Mike wanted us to achieve, so that\u2019s the way we really looked at that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And so then right, so we have a little bit of benefit still piece in 2017 and then this quarter\u2019s results reflected some of the benefit of the restructuring you took last year. Is that accurate?","John Gerspach","That is correct.","Betsy Graseck","And so with that restructuring you feel that within maybe a better market, not a normal market given how you define normal. You think you are at a good spot in the expense ratio that getting to 57%-56% is something you can achieve in 2017?","John Gerspach","Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into setting 2017 targets, because again I am still trying to figure out what the market environment is going to be for the balance of this year. But we do think that again everything that we\u2019re doing now is positioned to improve that operating efficiency and getting us close to that mid-50, that we\u2019re still targeting for Citicorp [Multiple Speakers] go ahead please.","Betsy Graseck","My basic question is just given more stabilized revenue environment the restructuring that you took this quarter feels like it\u2019s the last one you need to take of this magnitude. Is that reasonable or?","John Gerspach","I think it\u2019s reasonable as long as market conditions stay where they are. I mean as we said if market conditions are weakened then there may be other actions that we need to take, we\u2019re not deaf to the need to do things in order to improve returns. We think that\u2019s the right way to run a business. So we\u2019ve got a model in place, we set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not going to come around then we\u2019ll need to take some additional actions hopefully as you said we\u2019re finished with large repositioning actions.","Betsy Graseck","And then just a couple others if could you talk just one is on the card portfolio you have highlighted the fact that you\u2019ve got two positive growth in the card portfolio this quarter, which is great and that in-spite of the legacy card portfolio. Could you just remind us the size of the legacy card portfolio and over what kind of timeframe you expect that\u2019s going to be rolling off?","John Gerspach","No, I don\u2019t want to split the portfolio like that I will tell you that the core portfolio that again where we\u2019ve been making the investments. Those obviously the performance that we\u2019re getting out of that portfolio is even better than what you see on Slide 9. So the purchase sales growth in the core portfolio where we\u2019re making the investments, the core products is 16%. The average open accounts is up 9%, the average card loans is up I think it\u2019s 4%. So you can see that again that\u2019s having -- that is really driving the growth, which is exactly what we would expect it to do and that\u2019s why we believe that by the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to get the entire card portfolio to the point where we\u2019ll have year-over-year growth. But again we\u2019re not finished then, because we would expect even more growth coming out of that core portfolio in \u201917 and \u201918. And again that\u2019s before we even talk about adding it in Costco. And Costco first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting works, but we think that\u2019s a really good business and looking forward the contributions that will make in the second half of \u201917 and then into \u201918.","Betsy Graseck","Last question is just on the reserving, that, not reserving, but the outlook for what could be a 1.4 billion if oil stayed at 30 a lot off caveats there and you mentioned that 400 million above what you had previously indicated two-thirds of which coming from regulatory guidance. Could you just give us a little bit of a color around, what you think that regulatory guidance is, why it might be different from what your views are, you have the other one-third of revisions of your views versus two-thirds from them?","John Gerspach","Earlier this year, the OCC in particular came after the industry with some guidance first verbally and then in writing, largely centered as to how you should be treating some of the reserve based lending debt. And we still have some questions about how we are interpreting that guidance we think that in that 1.4 figure that I put out, we have taken the most conservative view as to how to interpret that guidance. But again we\u2019re still waiting to make sure that we have thought it, we\u2019ve interpreted that proper way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just had two quick questions, one on transferring Citi Holdings back into Citicorp now. Does that mean that we can expect really no announcements for future sales of businesses and you kind of finally reached this end state where you are happy with all your businesses?","John Gerspach","Well, we still have the consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia that are in Holdings. They may or may not be sold this year. If they are sold next year, we\u2019ll probably tell you about it. So I don\u2019t think that you've heard the last of some of the business sales but again Holdings is just becoming it's just a normal way of doing business right now almost everybody has got something whether it is a portfolio or whatever.","Mike Corbat","And what you've talked about John as we've finished the quarter at 73, we've got commitments already in place for 10, so as John mentioned Argentina, Brazil, Colombia you've got an operating business to one main version for Citi Finance Canada got away from those it is largely an asset portfolio. And so you'll be able to see assets and crop other -- move up or down, and we can provide color inside around those, but we\u2019re going to keep the focus to get the transactions closed and out the door, but again I just don\u2019t think it is all that meaningful to the financials of the Company anymore.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Right, I guess I'm referring to new announcements from here on out there shouldn't be doing announcements about country exits in that.","Mike Corbat","Obviously we will put out press released as we sign and as we close the transaction.","John Gerspach","What he is asking Mike is that are we going to have anymore sales and that's going to be dependent upon how we continue to assess the environment, if the environment says we need to scale back in some places we will be active in response to that.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And there is one question on Costco I mean can you close to the close now can you provide any update on portfolio size anything besides the accretion numbers you just gave?","John Gerspach","No I mean the portfolio will close on or about June 20 as it should be June 20th where the portfolio closes and everything moves over. As we get closer to that date, we may give you some more, but for now we're just focused on the June date.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Just a follow-up on the Costco deal about neutral earnings this year as we think next year and beyond obviously there was some upfront marketing investments and system investments, but any thoughts on how profitable it could be longer term?","John Gerspach","Well we haven't commented on the profitability of the individual portfolio and we won't do that, we will say it and we have said that the return characteristics of that portfolio it is perfectly into the cards business that we are trying to grow. So I have said on a number of occasions that our U.S. branded cards business should be one that when we are finished with the investments and adding in Costco and everything else, we think that it is a business that should earn an ROA somewhere in the 225 to 235 range. And Costco will be an important part of that it is -- the key to our U.S. cards business is to have a balanced portfolio, balance between our core proprietary products as well as the card portfolios where we have got our partner cards. So we think that's the right way to grow that business and that's the way we're moving forward and overall that business again 224 thereabouts ROA in the future.","Matt O'Connor","And then circling back on expenses, the improvement in the efficiency ratio rest of the year and it sounds like it mostly revenue dependent, I guess the question is if revenues are weaker how quickly can you adjust to that environment, I am just trying to get some sense of how variable is the cost structure. We didn't see much variable at the point or but it is also this one quarter but as you think over the next several quarters if revenue comes a little lighter, do have flexibility to bring those costs lower than flat?","John Gerspach","What I actually tried to guide you to, is the fact that we think the core expenses will be actually coming down especially in the second part of the year. We don't anticipate having anywhere near the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had in the first quarter either. So we think that expense reduction in the balance of the year is an important element of getting to that 57% efficiency ratio.","Matt O'Connor","Okay so you are -- right, how much of it if -- how much variable in this just coming back to the variable in this question, I mean how much flexibility is there to further bring down and I guess I was a little surprised the first quarter we didn\u2019t see much variability in the expense given how weak revenue was, obviously you took the repositioning it's just one quarter, but if the revenue is less than what you laid out today, how much kind of real time flexibility is there to bring down cost?","John Gerspach","That is -- we would rest that as we see with the revenue, I am not going to give you a figure that X percent of the expense base is variable because on a longer term basis every things variable, on a shorter term basis it's not going to be as variable as you would like it to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Just one other question for you Mike, I appreciate the color that you gave during the prepared remarks on CCAR and just a follow-up to that, are you confident enough or how confident are you in terms of checking off the regulator\u2019s qualitative to do list in terms of moving closer to our peers over the next few years in terms of payout especially in light of the kind of regulatory capital growth that Citi has enjoyed over the past couple of years?","Mike Corbat","Yes, that's clearly exactly Erika what we're committed to we fully understand that capital generation and capital return is a big part of the investment thesis and story and if you go back and look over the past couple of years, capital generation hasn't been our issue, and over the last three years we've generated over $50 billion of regulatory capital in the last quarter we generated $6 billion of regulatory capital and so ours is the normalization around the process and the credibility to make sure that we can get that capital back to our investors and that's exactly, exactly what we're working at and that's why so much time and energy has been put it on the qualitative side of things to be able to get to that point as quickly as possible.","Erika Najarian","And just, my follow-up is, John did I look at the headlines right, during your call with the media that the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR?","John Gerspach","I'm sorry, Erica.","Erika Najarian","Sorry, I saw a headlines on Bloomberg when you were -- held your call with the media this morning that I think it is so that you mentioned the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR?","John Gerspach","Yes you can't believe everything that you read online or in headlines, what I said was in my prepared remarks that during the Q&A that I had with the media, that the question came up as far as resolution planning and I said look we put a lot of hard work into developing the resolution plan and that we really carefully incorporated all the feedback that we received in late 2014 on the earlier submissions and we've embedded resolution planning into our day-to-day management of Citi. And I said that is very similar to what we've done with CCAR, so rather than think of CCAR and resolution planning as separate initiatives performed by isolated teams of people you consider both as integrated parts of our capital planning process and I said just as we have a continuous budgeting and forecasting process that is owned by our business managers, well the business managers also own the CCAR process and the resolution planning process. So, that's what I had said.","Erika Najarian","I see, thanks for the clarification John, I appreciate it.","John Gerspach","That's okay it's not that we suddenly have got a new management -- that's the wrong way to run CCAR and resolution. To have somebody separate -- I mean Barbara guides CCAR I guide resolution but it's the business managers that ultimately own it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matt Burnell","John maybe just one more quick one on energy, I presume you're at least part of the way through the spring lease termination, I'm curious what your expectations are in terms of the potential reduction of the borrowing bases across your borrowers, when that process is complete?","John Gerspach","Yes, we think that our reserve base lending exposure could be reduced by about $500 million, that would be combined the ICG as well as the consumer book, and it's probably 300-200, 350-150 with the ICG being slightly bigger piece of that.","Matt Burnell","Okay that seems a smaller percentage than what we've heard from a couple of other lenders, just to [Multiple Speakers] if I can follow-up just on a separate topic, the 202, no I guess 225 basis points of revenue that you're suggesting we should think about in terms of repositioning in legal costs, how far does that guidance go out, I mean it sounds like with legal amounts sort of ramping down, certainly never going to go away, but ramping down and the repositioning costs presumably are going down overtime, should we think about that ratio in '17 and '18 and on out, are you going to be continuing to reposition in depth in places like wealth management?","John Gerspach","Well I would say that again, we do think that 200 basis points and certainly 225 basis points is a very high charge on the revenues for legal and repositioning and it's relevant in the near-term 2016, we'll assess 2017 when we get there, but that would not be my view as to where we would expect legal and repositioning to be certainly beyond 2017. So, we should be looking at something which is a lot smaller but I'll give you more guidance as we get closer to the end of 2016.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally from me, maybe ticky tacky a little question, there was a substantial jump in the -- other than temporary impairment losses on the income statement this quarter to 465 million, is there anything you would like to call out there?","John Gerspach","Yes, Venezuela is in there, the Venezuela charge of $180 million, so that's a big piece of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Steven Chubak","I had a quick question on capital, John in the past I know you have highlighted operational risk declines as a meaningful source of future capital release and at the same time you've often talked about CCAR as being your binding constrain on capital, and it's something that a lot of clients have mentioned as well as a potential source of release, and what I'm wondering is because of the stress test exam only evaluates capital ratios under the standardized approach which excludes op risk from the denominator, I'm wondering whether that renders any potential benefit tied to op risk release, move going forward. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should still be crediting that as a future source of release given that is as not contemplated explicitly within the capital ratios within CCAR?","John Gerspach","Actually Steven I don't know whether I misspoke or you misheard, but it's probably my fault. But I don't think -- I certainly didn't intend to indicate that op risk would be a source of capital release as a matter of fact if anything I think that the op risk portion of the advanced approach RWA is very sticky right now. There just isn't a clear cut agreement either amongst us or even of the regulatory bodies really as to how you reduce op risk, so that's one of the reasons why when you've given you the Holdings\u2019 RWA in the past and this quarter for instance the Holdings' RWA is like $130 billion and of that $130 billion, $49 billion is op risk. That's the same 49 billion that was there in the fourth quarter, that's the same 49 billion that was there in the third quarter, so we really, we tend to think overall if you take a look at the Ks and the Qs I believe that our op risk RWA is like $325 billion and I consider that to be fairly sticky for now. Because I just don't have a good methodology in place to figure out how we drive that down. It's one of the very -- it frustrates me, I think it frustrates probably every CFO and Chief Risk Officer that you would talk to at a major bank right now, but that's kind of where we are.","Steven Chubak","Sorry, well thank you for clarifying that John and it certainly frustrates our investors and analysts as well. Just one question on the profitability targets, I know we spent quite a bit of time on it this morning but taking the challenging revenue by what we saw in 1Q the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency target and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year. Are you still committed to deliver on the 90 basis point ROA target that you had laid out, and I think reaffirm maybe as little as just one month ago?","John Gerspach","I would say that given all of that math the 90 basis points, again given where we ended up in the first quarter, it's going to tough for us to come in at 90 basis points.","Steven Chubak","And just one more quick piggyback question from me, was wondering what the stores at RWA, RWA growth was in the quarter. I did see that the balance sheet grew as well, but didn't know if you could clarify that?","John Gerspach","It's a little bit of the balance sheet growth and that's also being fuelled also by foreign exchange movements, we did, don't forget these are one day as opposed to being averages and so if you actually take a look at what happened at the end of March compared to where we were at the absolute end of December. In certain currencies the dollar actually weakened particularly against the euro, so that added $4 billion or $5 billion worth of RWA to us. We had some model changes that was like another 8 billion or 9 billion, we had I think $15 billion worth of just volume as the balance sheet grew and then there was a $5 billion increase in market risk which we're still looking at, that's why these are estimated numbers at this point in time don't forget. We'll lockdown the RWA calculations as we file the Q in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Just a question on total cost of credit, we talked a little earlier about losses, we talked a little about the energy outlook for the rest of the year but John relative to kind of a 2 billion on cost of credit for the HoldCo, how should we just understand how that goes especially with not really knowing what Costco will add to that?","John Gerspach","Well any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what consumer would be, but don\u2019t forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier you got to think in terms of Costco's revenue expense cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year and that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works you're forced to build loan loss reserves, basically over the first year that you have the portfolio. So think about Costco as it'll impact all the ratios but from a net income point of view right now it's basically breakeven, so that's not in there, but the $1.4 billion that I gave you as for as the forward look on ICG, that was all-in that was not just energy that\u2019s all-in ICG.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So that\u2019s all-in including reserve builds, that\u2019s all-in. Okay.","John Gerspach","That is all in.","Ken Usdin","And then do you think, I guess the last piece is if do you think, you\u2019ll continue to have any releases underneath in card or is it more just how the losses traject from here?","John Gerspach","As we continue to build the card portfolio, you are likely to see small reserve increases, that\u2019d be volume driven as opposed to being driven by a weakening in credit performance. So as you build portfolios, you do have to put aside reserve dollars. But again, we continue to believe that the credit performance in consumer whether it\u2019s on the U.S. book or international should continue to be very favorable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Eric Wasserstrom","A question on the treasury and trade solutions outlook, obviously one area that\u2019s been sort of weak globally has been trade finance, particularly trade finance related to various commodities, which is a big portion of that, of the global total. So how do we think about that pressure relative to the pretty positive guidance and recent trend that you\u2019ve indicated?","John Gerspach","Well, all of the trade performance is in that number that you see reported on whatever the slide number is 14 or 15 that is in the desk. So that\u2019s pretty much, how we\u2019re operating today. One of the things that we\u2019ve done overtime is we\u2019ve moved a lot more of our trade business, is being less balance sheet intensive. So it\u2019s we do a higher percentage of our business now on originate to sell and what that has given us is the balance sheet then to expand into the supplier finance aspects of trade. That has got better spreads and it really deepens the relationship then that we have with our client customers, so in recognizing everything you said, trade is not what I would call a tremendous growth business at this point in time. But it\u2019s got the relationship qualities to it and it\u2019s really adding to the overall franchise in a very positive way.","Eric Wasserstrom","So it sounds as if the volume pressures have been offset by basically moving down the ecosystem in terms of client opportunity, is that more or less correct?","John Gerspach","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s moving down the ecosystem. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re expanding the business that we can do with our target market clients by helping them in working capital management. And what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve gotten out a lot of the FI kind of sponsored business which is episodic it is very low spreads. We\u2019ll still originate those things, but then we tend to syndicate and so the trade finance receivable. So what we really want to do as we want to use trade as we do in almost every one of our product areas. We want to use our trade capabilities to help our clients manage their business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Vivek Juneja","A couple of questions, firstly John, you\u2019ve given the guidance last quarter, on net interest margin at 285 to 290 for the first half. You came in a little bit above that which was really flat linked quarter and are you still expecting to go to 285 to 290 for the first half and if so what would drive that down?","John Gerspach","No actually, what we\u2019ve revised our guidance to, as we think the 292 kind of holds flat in the second quarter.","Vivek Juneja","Okay.","John Gerspach","Again as we continue to offset the impact of Holdings\u2019 run off by a better spreads on our long business is largely due to the interest rate lift that we got, in coming out of December and by the tail-end of the year as we get the Costco of business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM and we\u2019re expecting somewhere in the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco. So we should end the year the second half of the year with a NIM in the range of 295.","Vivek Juneja","And Mike, a question for you, the equity of business, you\u2019ve had trading loss issues several times over the last couple of years. What are your plans to fix that?","Mike Corbat","Yes so as you look at this quarter, this quarter wasn\u2019t a quarter where the revenue performance was a result of trading issues. This was really from our perspective, and I think you saw across the industry but certainly for us the client volume, client flow challenges and John and I talked historically about the run rate, we\u2019d like to see the business at in the opportunity and again going back, there is no reason why as a firm we should be in the 8-9 area, we should be in the 5-6 area and we think there is an incremental couple of hundred million dollars a quarter overtime that we can add with just some reasonable investments and the investments come in a couple of ways, it comes in terms of and it comes in terms of balance sheet and given where our capital ratios are given where our leverage ratios are, client finance is an example, we think we've got that opportunities to go in and take share, and that's what we're trying to execute on.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. The only think I'd say is that the peers who are reporting so far your equity trading revenues year-on-year where weaker than those?","Mike Corbat","Yes they were.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further question in the queue at this time.","Susan Kendall","Great, thank you everyone.

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Ms. Kendall, you may begin.","Susan Kendall","Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factor section of our 2016 Form 10-K.","With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.","Mike Corbat","Thank you Susan, good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the second quarter or a $1.28 per share. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our businesses with loan and revenue growth across both sides of our house. In global consumer banking, our US retail bank showed significant growth outside of mortgage operations and we saw a 10% revenue growth in branded cards driven by the Costco portfolio. Internationally, we had continued revenue growth in both regions; Latin America where we've been investing in Citibanamex has now had revenue growth and positive operating leverage for five straight quarters. And in Asia we've seen growth in positive operating leverage for four straight quarters. The institutional clients group had a very strong quarter all around. While trading revenues were down 7% from the prior period, which had benefited from a surge of activity following the UK referendum, our banking results were excellent.","Investment banking had its best quarter in seven years. Treasury and trade solutions have shown consistent year-over-year growth for over three years now and the private bank had its best quarter in its history. We also generated $4.7 billion of regulatory capital during the quarter and returned over 2 billion of it to our shareholders resulting in a payout ratio over the last 12 months of nearly 90%. During the past year, we've reduced our outstanding common shares by 6% helping to increase our tangible book value per share to $67.32, and that's up 6% from a year ago and 14% higher than two years ago. Even still, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio has grown to 13%, 150 basis points above the 11.5% we believe we need to prudently operate the firm.","That's why our recent CCAR results were so important. Our capital return of $18.9 billion were nearly 130% of consensus estimates of net income enables us to reduce the amount of capital we hold, which will help drive increased returns for our investors. The momentum we established last year has continued throughout the first half of \u201817 with our net income up 6% so far and we continue to show steady progress towards our near-term financial targets. For the first half, our operating efficiency was 58%, our return on assets was 87 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity ex-DTA was 9.7%. Compared with our successful CCAR results, we are on a course to increase both the return on and return of capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We\u2019ll go into a lot more detail on how we're going to pursue both of these objectives when we host our Investor Day in less than two weeks and we look forward to seeing you there.","With that John will go through our presentation and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John?","John Gerspach","Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citi Group results. Net income of $3.9 billion in the second quarter declined 3% from last year, but EPS improved to $1.28 per share driven by a 6% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $17.9 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting 5% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp\/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets. Expenses were up slightly as higher volume related expenses, performance based compensation, and ongoing investments were largely offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased, mostly driven by lower reserve releases versus the prior year as well as higher volumes and NCL rates in consumer.","Looking at the first half of 2017, total revenues grew 3% year over year including 7% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat and net income growth 6% driving a 12% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks. Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year over year to $645 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp\/Other. On a sequential basis, we saw particular strength in loan growth this quarter with an increase of $16 billion in our core businesses that was broad-based across regions and products. And finally, deposits grew 2% year over year to $959 billion.","Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues grew 5% year over year in the second quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 2% from last year driven by lower mortgage revenues. Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $90 million year over year reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues were up 7%, driven by continued growth in average loans, deposits, and assets under management as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. We\u2019re continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold wealth management offering last year, driving growth in both households and balances with higher penetration on investment products.","Turning to branded cards, revenues of 2.1 billion grew 10% reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition as well as modest organic growth in our core portfolios, partially offset by the continued runoff of non-core portfolios. We continue to see strong client engagement in branded cards, with end of period balances up 10% year over year and 4% sequentially. Average card loans were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher transactor balances. Average full rate balances were stable quarter over quarter and we continue to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans with the resulting improvement in yields in the second half of the year as our investments mature. Finally, retail services revenues of 1.6 billion were 4% reflecting loan growth and a favorable prior period comparison. Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 6% from last year reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments partially offset by efficiency savings. We grew our operating margin by 4% year over year, and credit costs of 1.3 billion increased roughly $275 million from the last year.","Net credit losses increased to 1.2 billion, driven by the Costco portfolio, organic volume growth, and seasoning as well as the impact of collections activity in retail services. And we build roughly $100 million of loan loss reserves during the quarter. Looking at our current portfolios in more detail, in branded cards, the NCL rate of 2.9% was down from the prior quarter. We continued improvement in delinquencies, in line with our full-year outlook for NCL rate of around 280 basis points. And in retail services, the NCL rate increased to 4.8% reflecting the impact of portfolio seasoning as well as continuing softness in the collections rates we are experiencing once an account reaches mid stage delinquency. We're not seeing any deterioration in the rate of current accounts becoming delinquent. And we continue to expect NCL rates to be seasonally lower in the second half of the year, consistent with the trend we saw in the month of June.","However, given the lower collections rate, our full-year NCL rate in retail services will likely be around 460 basis points versus our prior outlook of 435 basis points. On Slide 5, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were up 3% versus last year, driving an 8% increase in operating margin. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by a 12% increase in retail banking reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. Card revenues were down modestly year over year, but improved sequentially as we continue to see improvement in full rate revolving loans trends. Full rate card balances grew slightly year over year this quarter. And with continued momentum we should see revenues growth year over year as we exit the year. And expenses grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.","Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year over year, driven by improvements in cards and wealth management, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Higher card revenues reflecting 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year as well a modest gain from the sale of our merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries. And while retail lending revenue declined versus last year, we saw sequential growth in both revenues and average loans this quarter driven by personal loans. Expenses in Asia grew 3% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending were partially offset by efficiency savings. Total international credit cost grew by $70 million year over year, mostly reflecting reserve builds in the current quarter to support volume growth in Latin America as compared to a net release in the prior year. Slide 6 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. NCL rates improved in every region this quarter, while delinquency rates remain broadly favorable as well.","Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 7. Revenues of $9.2 billion, grew 6% from last year, reflecting solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.8 billion were up 13%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion grew 3% or 4% in constant dollars, driven by continued volume growth and improved deposit spreads. Investment banking revenues of 1.5 billion were 22% from last year, reflecting strength in equity underwriting and M&A as well as continued momentum in debt underwriting. Private bank revenues of 788 million, grew 17% year over year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth, improved spreads and increased investment activity. And corporate lending revenues of 477 million or 25% reflecting lower hedging cost as well as the absence of a prior period adjustment for the residual value of a lease financing. While average loans were down modestly year over year, we saw good sequential growth, with volumes up 3% supporting core business activity among our global subsidiary clients. Total markets and security services revenues of 4.4 billion, decreased 5% from last year.","Fixed income revenues of 3.2 billion, declined 6%, primarily reflecting lower G10 currencies revenues given lower volatility in the current quarter and a comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago. Our G10 rates business was broadly stable versus last year. And our local markets rates and currencies business was stable as well, as we remained engaged with our corporate clients across our global network. Equities revenues were 11% lower versus last year reflecting episodic activity in the prior period as well as low volatility. Investor client activity in equities remain strong however, with cash equities up year over year as well as continued growth in prime finance revenue and client balances. And finally, in security services, revenues were up 10%, driven by growth in client volumes across our global custody business. We view security services as similar to TTS in many ways, serving as the core operating infrastructure for our investor clients around the world and providing the foundation for broader franchise relationships.","Total operating expenses of 5 billion were up 5% year over year as higher incentive compensation, investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 26%. Looking at the first half of 2017, revenues grew 11% year over year, with broad-based momentum. We continue to grow our network driven businesses in TTS, security services, and rate and currencies as we helped our clients grow and transact around the world. We grew revenues and deepened relationships in our private bank. We continued to support our clients with loan and debt capital markets financing and our franchise strength was evident in more episodic products as we gained significant share in equity underwriting and M&A. We grew the business while maintaining our expense discipline driving nearly 800 basis points of operating leverage. And credit quality remained strong consistent with our target client strategy. Together this drove an improvement in net income of nearly 30% over last year.","Slide 8 shows the results for Corporate\/Other. Revenues of $653 million declined significantly from last year, driven by legacy asset runoff and divestiture activity as well as the absence of gains on debt buybacks in the prior year. And expenses were down 24% to $990 million, reflecting the wind down of legacy assets. The pretax loss in corporate and other was roughly $200 million this quarter, better than our prior outlook for a loss of 350 million, mostly due to a benefit from cost of credit related to our legacy mortgage portfolio. Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin insurance split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate\/Other. This split between core accrual and trading related net interest revenue has been refined to attribute a slightly higher amount of funding costs to trading related activities under our prior disclosures. As you can see, total net interest revenue was roughly flat year over year in constant dollars at a $11.2 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue.","Core accrual net interest revenue of 10 billion was up 7% or over $600 million from last year driven by the addition of the Cosco portfolio, organic volume growth, and the impact of rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long-term debt. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenue grew by over $200 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the March rate increase and loan growth. However, we still saw decline in the core accrual net interest margin to 344 basis points reflecting higher cash balances. For the first half of 2017, core accrual revenue was up by $1 billion year over year and we expect to see a little more than $1 billion of growth in the remainder of the year. So in total, core accrual net interest revenue should grow by a little more than $2 billion in 2017 over 2016. However as previously noted, we still expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate\/Other. And finally we believe it is most relevant to look at trading related net interest revenue in the context of overall trading results. While trading related net interest revenue was down by roughly a third in the first half of 2017, our total equity and fixed income markets revenues grew by 4% year over year.","On Slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to 13% driven mostly by earnings, partially offset by $2.2 billion of common share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.2%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 6% to $67.32, in part driven by 6% reduction in our shares outstanding. So to conclude we're seeing momentum across the firm that gives us confidence as we go into the second half of 2017 and beyond. Starting with consumer, in North America, our investments in retail banking are delivering results with revenues excluding mortgage growing by 6% year over year in the first half. Retail services revenues continue to outperform our original outlook for a run rate of $1.5 billion per quarter this year, driven by higher than anticipated loan growth. And finally, in branded cards, we continue to see strong client engagement and balanced growth. In Asia, we generated year over year revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fourth straight quarter, driven by strength in cards and wealth management.","And in Mexico, we also generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter reflecting momentum in retail banking. On the institutional side as I described earlier, we saw strong performance across the franchise in the first half of 2017 driving double digit revenue growth and nearly 800 basis points of operating leverage. And we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing recurring accrual businesses like TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as well as episodic products like equity underwriting and M&A. As we look to the third quarter in North America consumer, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in retail banking excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as we grow full rate balances. Mortgage should continue to be a headwind as we had a particularly strong third quarter last year. And importantly, we expect earnings to grow modestly year over year in North America with continued momentum into the fourth quarter.","In international consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage. And turning to the institutional side, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in our accrual businesses, including PPS, security services, and the private bank. Market revenues will likely reflect a normal modest seasonal decline from the second quarter and investment banking revenues will likely return to a level closer to the first quarter perhaps a little lower assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third quarter underwriting activity. Expenses should decline sequentially. Cost of credit is expected to increase quarter over quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in Corp\/Other as well as continued volume growth in consumer. And we expect our tax rate to be in the range of around 32% for the second half of the year.","And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hey John, just quick follow up on the net interest income outlook for the second half for you know more than a billion, slightly more than a billion of growth in net interest income in the second half. What does that assume in terms of the interest rate environment, Fed hikes and also just roughly loan growth assumptions in there?","John Gerspach","Well, we've only got one more interest rate hike that we\u2019re assuming for this year and it's in December. So that really isn't going to have much of an impact on that outlook at all. But it is inclusive of loan growth. We continue to see loan growth of you know quite frankly it\u2019s nothing more than we had baked into the outlook that we gave you at the end of the first quarter.","John McDonald","And then for you and Mike, I was just wondering do you guys still feel good about the ROTCE targets getting to 10% ex-DTA and 18% and 10% on a fully loaded basis in \u201819, and just maybe a little bit of talk about what you see as the drivers of those ROTCE goals. Do you need to pick up in trading activity or further rate hikes? What are some of the key drivers there?","Mike Corbat","We do, we feel I think very good about it. I referenced the metrics in terms of operating efficiencies, returns et cetera in the first half of the year and the momentum that we carried out of the latter half of last year. And then John has set up our expectations for the second half and feel the combination of the levers we have, John, between some revenue growth, between continued expense discipline, and a reasonable environment around cost of credit and obviously meaningful capital return gives us the pathway to hitting those.","John Gerspach","Yeah, I mean John, we\u2019ll go into a little bit more detail on that obviously at our Investor Day in 10 days or so. But as Mike said, the drivers, they remain the drivers that we've been talking about all along. It's improving that return of capital and you saw the first indication of that when we got to CCAR results at the end of June. So we anticipate continuing to be able to return the right amount of capital, and we expect consumer to be a driver into the future. When we take a look at the two businesses that we have and we lay it out for you in one of the pages in the back of this deck, consumer for the trailing 12 months in generating an ROTCE of 12.8% and we believe that it should be over time capable of generating returns in excess of 20%, just over 20%. So that's going to be one of the critical drivers, and we'll take you through those details on Investor Day.","John McDonald","Okay. We'll look forward to that and then maybe one just quickie on the quarter here John, it looks like for the first half of the year, the DTA utilization has been about 900 million for the first half, a little bit more in the first quarter than the second. What are you thinking about for the rest of the year and I think annually you also talked about 2 to 3 billion as a target, how do you feel about that?","John Gerspach","We always talk about $2 billion as our usage coming out of earnings. And so, for the first half of the year we're at $900 million, so we're roughly on pace to utilize that $2 billion for the year.","John McDonald","Okay, and you\u2019ve just had some OCI ,swings I guess throughout the year affected it.","John Gerspach","First quarter OCI, give it. Second quarter OCI, take it away.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Just maybe we could talk a little bit about the international, it seems like the outlook is improved economically overseas. Are you starting to see some impact from that in terms of growth and with sort of the back up in the yield curves overseas, do you see any help from the rate environment overseas yet or does it have to be more the short end of the curve to help you on that front?","Mike Corbat","When you look at - and John and I each referenced the growth - sequential growth and positive operating story continuing in Asia and in Mexico, and I would say that those environments are reasonable environments. Are they growing where we\u2019d like them to grow from a macro perspective? No, we've had downgrades in terms of Mexico growth rates. but again, 8% growth - revenue growth coming out of Mexico in a country that's growing sub 2, again, I think illustrating what we've talked about that we believe over the intermediate longer term, we've got the ability to grow our international front franchises at or in many cases at multiples the pace of domestic growth rates, and the other piece if you look in there is that in Mexico, it's the combination of our retail business in Asia, it is wealth management. And if you look at wealth management AUM throughout year over year and different metrics continuing to attract AUM into the business. So we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses and the ability to continue to get this type of growth. And as we've said, we expect that trend to continue in the near term in the second half of the year. Again, with growth and positive operating leverage.","John Gerspach","And Jim, you get a sense of some of the momentum that we're seeing if you look at it in short, we included on Slide 18 of the debt that we just went through in the appendix. And you can see that in so many countries now we're getting growth quarter over quarter, it's that sequential loan growth that is really driving it. And that's a combination of things, as Mike said, its good engagement with the clients, you\u2019re seeing the results of a lot of the repositioning actions that we've been taking and as we reposition portfolios, we started to focus on different types of lending. A lot of it is in Asia specifically. Better use of digital channels to engage with clients. And actually be able to engage with them at the point of making or when they're entering into a store, they're about to make a purchase and we can offer them alternatives. And so you're seeing it. Year-over-year in international, we had 1.3% loan growth. and we have 1.5% loan growth sequentially in the second quarter. So that's one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about the momentum that we're getting there. And it's not just in consume, in similar fashion, we saw good momentum in Asia in particular in ICG business and our corporate lending. And this wasn't lending that was episodic not linked to a deal. This is lending where people were you know taking down loans to address working capital or CapEx needs. So again we feel pretty good about the momentum that we're seeing.","Jim Mitchell","And any impact from my other question on rate, from rates, yield curve steeping overseas, obviously that's still very low rates. We still we need to see short rates move up for that to really be an impact. ","John Gerspach","Well yeah, I mean again we're not counting on that type of environment. So again in the projections that I\u2019ve given you, we're not looking at interest rates suddenly wildly increasing across the board. So it's not rate - our outlook is not rate dependent. I mentioned in the - when I spoke - when I answered John McDonald's question that we\u2019ve got one more rate hike for the US built in and its December of this year. And quite frankly we're assuming one more rate hike in \u201918, one more rate hike in \u201919 and one more rate hike in \u201920. So again, we're not looking as though this is all going to be rate influenced growth. We like the franchise that we built.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was hoping you can provide a little more detail on the expense outlook for the back half of the year. I think you said, down versus sorry on the third quarter [indiscernible] down versus 2Q. And you've also talked about full-year efficiency ratio target in the past I think of 58%. So just hoping to elaborate a little bit more on the back half year expense outlook and then what you think of the efficiency side - efficiency ratio?","Mike Corbat","We're still targeting, Matt, we're still targeting that full year efficiency rate of 58%. And so on a lot of cases, the expenses -- the expense performance in the tail half of the year is going to be driven by how revenues come up. That's why I'm always a little hesitant to give specific reference, guidance as to expenses more than a quarter out because if revenues go up, we\u2019ll have some increase in expenses, if revenues come down, we\u2019ll manage through that 58% efficiency ratio.","Matt O'Connor","And besides expenses tied to revenue, are there some costs that you know are going to drop off, whether it's severance or legal repo embedded in the current run rate or efficiency savings that are lined up.","Mike Corbat","Well, we still have is we\u2019ll have the legacy assets continue to wind down, so there would be revenues that run off associated with the wind down of the legacy assets, we\u2019ll have expenses that come up with legacy assets. But that is the kind of things that we baked in and we've been reporting on all along. Obviously, legacy assets now have been further reduced. Now we went into the year with legacy assets you know the assets formerly known as holdings at $54 billion and by the end of June, they were down to $44 billion. So we\u2019ve already had a significant run off in those legacy assets. They'll continue to come down [indiscernible] run off. Legal and repositioning, we would enter the year; I believe we gave you some guidance that we thought that for the year legal and repositioning costs would be running something close to 200 basis points on Citigroup revenues. And we're running a little bit below that right now and I would anticipate probably for the full year legal and repositioning costs are probably going to come in somewhere around maybe 25 basis points less than we had originally guided.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","John, thank you so much for the outlook on net interest income for the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more of your insight, two of your peers mentioned that they anticipate corporate or wholesale deposits to outflow as a result of Fed balance sheet reduction. And I'm wondering what Citigroup\u2019s outlook is for - how sensitive your deposit base could be from outflow on the back of Fed balance sheet reduction.","John Gerspach","Obviously this whole topic of Fed balance sheet reduction is uncharted territory. It\u2019s a place we've never been before. So it's really hard to say that you've got a model. And it's really hard to say that it's going to have any sort of major impact over the course of the next six months. So we you know we are assuming that as rate increases occur and as the Fed does wind down its balance, we will see betas increase slightly in our corporate side business, but we do not have anything major put into the outlook for the second half of this year. ","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my second question and I expect that maybe some of this would be deferred to your Investor Day, but given how much capital that you generate, even if we assume that you can continue to increase your payout from here, you clearly are still well over where you think a normal level of capital would be that's appropriate for your business. And also with regular form, that could even free up even more capital. And I'm wondering Mike, as we look over the next three years, what businesses do you think would -- you would plow in some of this excess capital that you think would be great growth opportunities for Citigroup.","Mike Corbat","Well, as you look, I think Erika, they would largely stay consistent with what we've talked about, where you're seeing the growth. So one is, you shouldn't expect any outsized investments. I think what we've talked about is investments as BAU, investments largely being or really exclusively being self funded. But again, we continue to expect to see good growth rates in no particular order in terms of our TTS businesses, what we're doing in the private bank across our retail franchises, around the globe again with an emphasis on things we're doing here in the US and we're going to talk about that quite a bit in terms of Investor Day, the cards investments we've made. ","So we don't necessarily see a lot to do there, but we see a trajectory from that in the future. And then, again what we do is we just look at where our clients want to go and be and be there to support them. And so it's difficult to go too far out in terms of exactly what that environment is going to look like because we could have some changes to tax or trade and we'd be in a benefit to be able to or we'd be in a position to be able to help those clients realign their interests and to support them in that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I had a couple of questions on the retail partner card business, maybe just to start. Wanted to get along as just how the general struggles of traditional offline retailers might be affecting or affect that business in the future, maybe I'll start there and then I have a couple more detailed follow-ups.","John Gerspach","So far, we're not really seeing anything like that in the numbers certainly in our business. If you take a look, as I mentioned, our loans are growing nicely in that business right now and we're still seeing very good customer engagement with our retail partner cards. If you take a look in the supplement, you'll see that purchase sales, up 22% sequentially, up 2% year-over-year. So there's no indication yet that we got any sort of impact in our retail services business from that.","Brian Foran","Thanks. Two maybe smaller follow-ups. I mean one detail question I get a lot is what happens if a retailer goes bankrupt, so I'm sure every relationship is different, but maybe just, I'm sure you get the question, I mean do chargeoffs spike, is there an offset from RSAs or lower marketing, has the book gone runoff, or can you move it over to a branded offer. So just any thought you can provide there. And then two on the comments around the charge-off guidance, anything that stand out to you why mid-stage collections would be deteriorating for the retail partner book, but not for the Citi printed book.","John Gerspach","Yeah. Let\u2019s -- we can get -- we can go anywhere you want in any order. If you stay with what happens if there is a bankruptcy, one of the core competencies that we have in the business is actually helping our clients, when we look at that, our client in retail services is the retailer. And so we're definitely focused on partnering with them and really becoming their partner and advising their approach to selling. We provide them with advanced analytics digital. ","Therefore, so, if there is a restructuring that one of our retailers has to go through, we actually think that we can -- we can help them by leveraging our broad set of proprietary loyalty platforms et cetera, et cetera in order to help them through. So I'm not going to say that we look for it as an opportunity, but we actually think that we could be of use there. Plus depending upon the retailer, we also have on average about a third of our book are general purpose cards. So they are cards that are able to be used outside the store as well, which would serve to mitigate then any sort of impact on us.","Will I move to collections?","Brian Foran","Yeah. Just why you would be showing up in retail partner, but it didn\u2019t seem to be showing up from your departments in branded?","John Gerspach","Yeah. And that\u2019s because it really is something that is focused in retail services as opposed to branded and it could be because of the nature of the receivables. With branded, obviously, it's a slightly higher FICO base, but also with branded, you're dealing with -- the average receivable is higher. So retail services tend to have lower -- lower average balances and what we're seeing and one of the reasons for, I mentioned as being a collections issue, we're really not -- normally if you\u2019re facing a credit quality issue, you're going to see deterioration in your early bucket flows. In simple English, you're going to see current accounts moving to delinquency at a faster rate. But we're not seeing that.","We've had fairly stable early bucket flows for the past 2.5 years in his business. And I think that's reflective of our continued strong overall borrowing profile in this business. So it doesn't appear to be that we're really seeing a deterioration in the credit quality of what we're booking, but what we are experiencing compared to what we had in prior years is that there's a higher rate of accounts advancing because the later delinquency buckets, once they get to being two or more payments behind and that's really why we're focused on the collections process and we're developing a number of new and enhanced ways to communicate with our customers, using their preferred channel. I was talking to Bill Johnson the other day, we doubled our text messaging rates over the last few months. So we\u2019ve begun to see some evidence of progress, but it's slower than what we had originally targeted and therefore that results in our change in guidance.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","A couple of questions, first of all, just more of a clarification on the guidance of North American consumers. You indicated that earnings should be up moderately I believe year-on-year. Is that from, I guess, there was 780 million and 811 million, 3Q, 4Q of last years. So we should expect some moderate increase versus that threshold. Is that the right way to think about it?","John Gerspach","I think I said modest instead of moderate, but yes.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Modest. Okay. Fair enough. And if -- okay. So if my math is right, that's still something around the neighborhood of, I don\u2019t know, 130 basis points ROA or so. So you\u2019ll give, I suppose you'll give a more expansive description of the ramp-up you expect in that segment at your Investor Day over the next couple of years. Now, I guess -- and on, secondarily on capital deployment, how -- is it premature to start thinking about M&A as a strategy to deploy excess capital. ","It sounded like if from the answer to an earlier question, but you obviously have a ton of excess capital. Can you just share with us how you're thinking about potentially looking at non-organic types of opportunities in terms of whether it be from a product financial return segment strategy. You\u2019ve obviously done Costco in the past, but how do you think about that as part of the toolkit so to speak for capital strategies.","John Gerspach","So one is, we\u2019re open to M&A opportunities. Again, you referenced Costco, Best Buy, other things we've done along the way. We clearly have the financial capacity in our capital, our leverage ratios, our balance sheets, but importantly, anything that we do Saul is going to have to be within the target of our footprint, our clients and the businesses we\u2019re in. What you shouldn't expect is that we're going to go out and we're going to go venture into some place or some products that we historically haven\u2019t been. So if some things in footprint, in strategy, the price makes sense, we're happy to go after it.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. Final one, just more of a ticky-tacky question, page I guess 9, the 280 million of NII from legacy assets, is that primarily Brazil and I guess we\u2019re still expecting that transaction to close, is that -- is that the right way to think about that?","John Gerspach","Well, it\u2019s a collection of a whole bunch of assets. We still have a sizable mortgage portfolio, US mortgage portfolio in that as well.","Saul Martinez","Okay. But some portion of the 280 I guess is -- should be going away in the second half?","John Gerspach","I think you should continue to expect that to wind down over time, but it's not all going to go away in the second half, but yes something that we closed Brazil, which we should close during the second half of the year, then a portion of that will go away.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","John, I had a question on some of the capital targets that were outlined on the call. One of the things that we've been hearing from a lot of folks is just given the strong improvement in your CCAR results, you have some of the benefits outlined in the treasury white paper that was published recently. It does feel to us like the 150 basis points of cushion that you are assuming within your 11.5% target is very conservative and I recognize that it's going to be a multi-year process for you to take your 13% today and bring that down to 11.5% over time, but has your thinking changed or evolved at all with regards to your capital targets? I'm just wondering if there's any flexibility to manage that even lower over time.","John Gerspach","Well, over time, if regulatory rules change, sure, we\u2019ll have the ability to manage that overtime. But right now, I\u2019m still comfortable leaving it. We originally started to talk about a range of between 11 and 11.5 and we\u2019re still targeting within that range, but Mike and I being the personality that we are, if there is a range, we\u2019re going to go towards the more conservative end of that range. And so right now, our guidance would be that, we expect to be able to operate prudently at 11.5%. And if there are some clarifications in regulatory rules overtime, then we will definitely adjust that target.","Steven Chubak","Understood. And then maybe just one follow-up on leverage exposure. You've spoken in the past about how leverage is not your binding constraint, you see compelling opportunities to deploy some of that excess and we saw a pretty decent uptick in leverage exposure in this quarter and even some last quarter as well. And I'm just wondering which product lines are you deploying that capacity and just given the prospects for some SLR relief, are you seeing any changes in terms of competitive dynamics in some of the more leverage intensive businesses?","John Gerspach","Let me start at the back end, no, we're not seeing any change in competitive practices as a result of people thinking that there is going to be changes in the SLR, because again, there's been a paper put out that\u2019s made some proposals, but nothing has been implemented yet. And so we're not going to act on proposals. What's been driving the growth certainly for this quarter, that growth is really, don\u2019t forget, leveraged exposure is off your average balance sheet and our average balance sheet really as a result of a lot of the growth that we had in loans grew during the quarter. ","So the single largest driver of that change is the growth in the average balance sheet sequentially. We had our average balance sheet grew by about $40 billion quarter-on-quarter. And if you take a look at the leverage exposure, it grew about $40 billion, $46 billion. So it\u2019s the average balance sheet. So when you think then about, so let\u2019s grow in your average balance sheet, the average balance sheet at 40 billion is about equally split between an FX impact, don't forget the dollar did weaken in the quarter. We had -- we grew cash and then we had growth in loans and some growth in trading assets.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one more quick one from me, just on liquidity, which has been certainly a popular topic ahead of the fed balance sheet unwind. Looking at your LCR, it's at a very healthy 123% and despite significant cushion, you've talked about resolution planning as a binding constraint on liquidity deployment and I\u2019m just wondering whether you believe or what you think is at least an appropriate LCR target for the firm and how we should think about maybe some excess capacity for deployment as the Fed begins to unwind the balance sheet, maybe providing some opportunities to deploy some of that excess cash in higher yielding MBS?","John Gerspach","Yeah. We\u2019re currently, as you say, we\u2019re currently running in that 123ish range and they\u2019d probably tick up a little bit this quarter, I think, closer to 125, when all is said and done. And resolution has been the driving factor in that. So if you look at our balance sheet, during the course of the last year, we\u2019ve had a significant growth in our cash balances. Our cash balance has grown by about $36 billion year-over-year. And since the beginning of this year, it's grown 26 billion and most of that growth is that as we begin to finalize the plans that we had to, in order to come to compliance with what we needed to do for resolution purposes. ","That is pretty much behind us now. We've filed our plan. We like where we are. We\u2019re -- we\u2019ll see whether or not the Fed and the FDIC hold our plan on the same highest theme that we do. But now that we have built the cash and we\u2019ve built the liquidity, now, we can go about what we normally do and begin to optimize it. So I don't see cash becoming something that we continue to build from here on out. Hopefully, we will be able to take some of that cash down and then put it to other use.","Steven Chubak","Okay. But if I am understanding it correctly that your comments John suggest that you need to manage to around 120% liquidity in order to meet the standards for the resolution plan that you hold yourselves to and hopefully the Fed and the FDIC will approve?","John Gerspach","I don't want to give a guidance yet, because we haven't come to the conclusion yet of the optimization process. So don't take what I said as guidance other than we would expect that 123 to ultimately be lower. But I\u2019m not ready to give you a number yet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just a question or two on the loans and the loan yield. You guys showed your pretty good loan growth and -- but yet, you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned, but I'm just wondering can you help us distill whether the [indiscernible] loan yields was related to the ongoing corporate other runoff and\/or is there just a different mix in terms of, it looks like it's card that's growing the most. I'm just wondering what's happening underneath the surface, especially with a couple of rate hikes in between the last couple of quarters?","Mike Corbat","So there are several underlying stories that go in there and you\u2019re touching on a couple of them. Certainly when you take a look at overall NIM or overall yield, then that definitely gets impacted by the run-off of legacy assets, because those are for the most part higher yielding assets. So that's one. We had -- the loan growth and don\u2019t forget, our NIM statistics are all quoting average balances and so therefore the $16 billion of loan growth that I talked about as being there for end of period loan to end of period loan, a lot of that came on during the quarter. ","So we don't have the full quarter benefit of that. It's in the end of period numbers, but we roughly got $9 billion to $10 billion of growth in our average balance sheet. And it\u2019s the average loans that\u2019s actually then going to drive your NIM. In some of the cases, when you look at cards and we quoted that the increase of $1 billion in average loans was really driven by Transactor account, so we don't get any loan yield off of that. But we like the business that we've been putting on. ","We certainly would rather have loan growth than not loan growth. Importantly, the loan growth that we\u2019re putting on, like I said, it is widespread. It is spread nicely across regions. It\u2019s spread nicely across products and it\u2019s all in support of client related activities. And therefore, look at the earnings, not only that we get on the loan itself, but the earnings that will provide us by further deepening the relationship that we have with each of our clients, whether that be a consumer client or a corporate client.","Ken Usdin","Right. Okay. Understood. And then just one follow-up on the card business. It's kind of goes -- it's also a piecemeal one, but simply your net credit margin in both retail and in branded cards, as you've talked, has continued to go down and you're talking about that inflection. So are we close to the bottom in the net credit margin for both of those businesses and how do you expect that to traject?","John Gerspach","Yeah. I mean obviously a little bit of that from retail services is going to depend on just how quickly then our collection efforts are able to stem the tide of the NCL. But I would anticipate certainly in branded cards that we are either at or very close to the bottom of that NCL decline.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Moving over to the institutional clients group, your investment banking numbers were very strong, the growth in ECM. Can you share with us, was it more market driven or have you hired some folks in the last 12 months or 18 months and now they're bringing revenues in?","Mike Corbat","Gerard, I think it's a combination of those things. We've brought in some good people, very good people. Again, we know in ECM, in M&A, it\u2019s your sectors, it's the calendar, it's the backlog. And I would say that obviously a pretty slow start to the first half of last year, obviously a much better start to the first half of this year. And I think the activities in sectors that we've got good positioning and came through in the numbers and again not just in equity, but as well as in debt and as well as in M&A.","John Gerspach","Yeah. I think this is exactly what we've been working on for the last several years is that that old story. We've worked the last three years to become an overnight success and that\u2019s, when you look at it, we've been talking to you about adding talent, enhancing our industry coverage. It actually goes back to one of the changes that Mike made when Mike came in as CEO, where with he and Jamie, they decided to reduce the number of corporate clients that we had in our coverage. So we've taken our client coverage down from 32,000 clients down to 14,000 clients. ","So it\u2019s more focused coverage, which allows you to have better understanding of your clients and your clients see that you\u2019ve got better understanding, you're in a better position then to serve them. And I think you\u2019re seeing a combination of client segmentation, adding the appropriate talent and three years of hard work and again, it\u2019s things that we\u2019ve been building up to. I think even more impressive perhaps than the result that you see in the second quarter is when you combine it with the first quarter and take a look at the first half results, because now for the first half, year-over-year, our advisory revenues are up 20%, our ECM revenues are up 82% and our DCM revenues are up 21%. ","So when we look at it, we think we've gained 100 basis points of market share in the last six months when you compare 2017 compared to where we were in 2016. Now, as I said in the media call earlier, I don't want you to count on the fact that we're going to gain 100 basis point of market share every six months, but we do like the momentum that we've got building in our investment banking capabilities and we've got great confidence in the team that we've got on the field and obviously so do our clients.","Gerard Cassidy","And to follow-up on comments you made in your prepared remarks, John, we recognize seasonality affects third quarter results. Keeping that in mind, how is the pipeline, when you look at maybe versus third quarter last year, which would reflect an apples-to-apples comparison for seasonality.","John Gerspach","Yeah. I would say that we are in a stronger position as far as our engagement with clients. You don't have to look much further than the fact that in announced M&A, I believe now that we\u2019re a number 2 in the league tables.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Coming back to the trading part, you mentioned that the FIC revenues were down due to G10 Rates or G10 Governments. Can you give us some color --","John Gerspach","[indiscernible]. If that\u2019s what I said, then I completely misspoke, because FIC revenues are down really because of G10 FX. It\u2019s really all FX related. Our G10 rates is basically stable year-over-year, which is a great performance in the market environment that we've had. So when we look at the decline in FIC revenues, again, year-over-year, in the second quarter, it's really, the lion's share of it is being driven by G10 FX is reflecting a low volatility that I think everyone has spoken about in the market. When you take a look at our G10 Rates business, fairly stable; our local markets rate business, fairly stable; our local markets currency business, fairly stable; spread products, fairly stable.","Gerard Cassidy","Yes, it was my error, but that's the color I needed. I was hoping you're going to give us -- very good.","John Gerspach","Well, you certainly got me there quickly.","Gerard Cassidy","I wanted to make sure you're listening. On a bigger question, the treasury came out with obviously their report on some changes they think would make sense to the banking system from a regulatory standpoint. If you guys had [indiscernible] and had to pick one or two that would benefit you the most, what would it be in those recommendations that treasury had, whether it\u2019s SLR or any of the other types of issues they brought up?","Mike Corbat","I think one that we talk pretty publicly about, we've talked to Treasury about it and it's included in there. One is, for us and I think for a number of the other banks, it's likely that CCAR is going to stay the binding constraint and around anything that's a binding constraint, you just need more transparency. So we'd like more granularity in terms of some of the numbers and have the ability to explore some of the approaches that the Fed has and because Secretary report came back, that's one of the recommendations that they have. I would say things in there ranging from how do we think about, how do we bring together LCR and SLR and get some of the inconsistencies out. ","We have no issue from a headline perspective with Volcker, but the fact that we do five -- that there's five agencies empowered and they all believe that they have the voice at the table around it obviously creates conflict disagreement and from our side, certainly creates a lot of work. The good news I think in most of the paper is that the things that are in there don't require changes of law to implement. So hopefully as we get people in the seats, some of the heads of the agencies start to come together. We can actually start to effect some of this change, which hopefully we can start to make some meaningful progress on hopefully in the fourth quarter of this year.","John Gerspach","As Mike said, some of the more common sense type of proposals, you\u2019ve referenced the SLR. Eliminating the need to hold capital against cash and things like that, that would definitely be something that would I think be the right way to think about.","Mike Corbat","Viewing the dividend is something you can\u2019t turn off. And again, all the good news is all these things are mentioned.","John Gerspach","Not assuming that your balance sheet is going to grow in times of stress. These are all very commonsensical changes that will be beneficial and I don't think it would impact safety and soundness at all.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","So just two quick questions. On Korea, I noticed that the loans were down quarter-on-quarter, even though you mentioned the strength in Asia and also there\u2019s an agreement to close a lot of branches there. Could you just give us some updated thought on the market, because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve gotten past the point where there was regulatory headwinds and we were looking for growth again? Is that not the right way to think about that market?","John Gerspach","So in Korea, as we\u2019ve said, we announced the fact that we\u2019re repositioning that business, we're taking the light physical footprint in a much more agile approach to things as we move forward consistent with the way we're approaching other markets. So that is having a little bit of disruption there, but we think it's the right thing to do going forward. We will be closing 90 something branches over the course of time and concentrating the branches in more of the wealth centers, so it's having an impact there, and we\u2019re also transitioning out of being heavily reliant on the mortgage product in Korea into much more of a personal installment loan product. So you're just seeing that in the results, but you'll notice that the portfolio itself is still holding up fairly well.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then you also mentioned that you were pleased with the success of Citigold in North America. I mean is this just using Citigold to get back into the wealth management business?","John Gerspach","Citigold is really targeted at being a wealth management business. It\u2019s the way that we really run the retail operation in Asia and so what we have really done is imported a lot of the techniques that we've been using in Asia for the last five or six years and reintroduced them into the US. We didn't have the capability of really doing that before, much before last year as we were still trying to get all of our North America consumer systems on a common platform, so we can have one broad view of our client. ","It's hard to manage somebody from a client relationship when you've got one system that has their retail deposits, another one that has their credit card and another one that has their mortgage, another one that has their investment assets. We've now been able to bring all that together, it's given us a much better view of the client. That's been able now to give us a much better ability to actually segment the clients. And so when you think about the fact that we really just launched Citigold in November or re-launched it in November of last year, the progress that we've made in the last seven months is pretty encouraging.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I guess the question is, are you just rebuilding a business that you sold Smith Barney several years ago.","John Gerspach","No. Not at all. Smith Barney was not a Citigold type of -- Smith Barney could have been a piece of a Citigold offering, but Smith Barney just didn't fit with us. What makes this thing work is that there's great cooperation between the investment management people and the bankers and you really need that in order to grow a Citigold type of business, because you want to encourage deposits and you want to encourage lending and you want to encourage assets under, growth in assets under management, you want to be able to pull all of those levers, whatever makes sense for the client.","Mike Corbat","And I think the other piece Brian that's important is the operating account, where the stickiness and what it means to have the relationship steeped in an operating account, in the depository account where very, very, very often you would actually see -- in a Smith Barney relationship, you would actually see the operating account actually at another institution. We hear it kind of comes from the operating account and again, you can look at the numbers we publish in terms of the deposit balances, the average deposit balances in our Citigold account. And so there are opportunities there in that diversification away from the pure deposit relationship to investments into broader lending and investing type products. So I think there's some reasonable difference to it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses.","Adam Hurwich","A quick question, John. Doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2019m following upon your comments on cards. So does it make sense to look at transaction volumes as a ratio of balances and if it does, how should we look at that going forward?","Mike Corbat","Adam, this is why I always love talking to you. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way before. So before I answer it, let me think about that and I\u2019ll get back to you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Al Alevizakos","I've got two questions for you. First question is on the treasury and trade solutions. I've realized that there's no real benefit so far from the interest rates improvement. Therefore, I would like to know whether there is any downward pressure from something else that we actually don't see since it's only a one-liner. ","And secondly, since we're in Europe, we would like to know whether there's any comment regarding the trading performance regarding the separate region, so whether you've seen any kind of obvious trends, any different trends in the US versus Europe or versus Asia.","Mike Corbat","Okay. Let me start with the second one. There is certainly strong trading results coming out of EMEA. Again, we look at the entirety of the region, so I can't be specific to Western Europe, but definitely stronger trading results in EMEA and again that is certainly stronger there than we would have seen, we had decent results in Latin America, decent results in Asia, but good strength coming out of EMEA. As far as the first question, when we look at TTS, we definitely did get a benefit. TTS remains, as I said, a foundational business for our institutional strategy. So that still is good. ","The revenue growth did slow a little bit this quarter to 4% as opposed to where we were running before, but we had seen growth rates of 6% or more. So there was some pressure that we saw on deposit pricing, but nothing out of the ordinary. Again, as you get into the later stages of rate hikes, you're going to see increases in your betas and that's embedded in all of our models. So nothing there. Importantly, what we continue to see in TTS is we're continuing to gain share in SWIFT volumes and chip volumes and importantly in commercial card volumes. So we think that that business is one that should continue to grow for us, although it's probably going to be more in that 4% to 5% growth range.","Operator","There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Ms. Susan Kendall.","Susan Kendall","All right. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to me and my team.

Today's call will be hosted by John Andrews, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objection, please disconnect at this time. Mr. Andrews, you may begin.","John Andrews","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. As usual, on our call today, our CEO, Vikram Pandit, will speak first. Then, John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation in some detail, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take your questions. ","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings and including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2011 Form 10-K. ","With that said, let me turn it over to Vikram.","Vikram S. Pandit","John, thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. As you know, earlier today, we reported net income of $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2012. x CVA and excluding the net gain from minority stakes, we earned $3.4 billion in net income or $1.11 per share. This is a significant increase both from the first and fourth quarters of 2011. ","While our business has operated in an improved environment, we also saw the benefit of our investments. We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across all 3 of Citi's core businesses, that is, Global Consumer Banking, Securities and Banking and Transaction Services. Key drivers, such as loans in Citicorp, grew by 12% from the prior year, while we deepened client relationships and improved market share in several businesses. ","Global Consumer Banking generated $10 billion in revenues in the quarter, up 5% from the previous year. Securities and Banking revenues rebounded, driven by particularly strong performances in Fixed Income. In Transaction Services, revenues were a record $2.7 billion, reflecting strong growth, particularly in trade finance, where our unique global footprint gives us a meaningful competitive edge. ","Overall, net income x CVA for our institutional businesses increased 12% compared to first quarter of 2011 and was 4.5x larger when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 7% during the quarter, and Citi Holdings assets are now at $209 billion or just 11% of our total assets. ","While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, there is still much macro uncertainty, and we'll continue to manage our risk carefully. ","Let me now turn to capital and liquidity. First, let me share with you some numbers since we further added to our capital base during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital and a ratio of 12.4% under Basel I, up from 11.8% at the end of fourth quarter. And for the first time, we're sharing our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel III basis, which stood at an estimated 7.2% at the end of the quarter. Keep in mind that Basel III requires the deductions of certain minority holdings on a dollar-for-dollar basis from an institutions capital base, and the 7.2% figure reflects that. ","In aggregate, our minority investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, such as Akbank and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, amount to 120 basis points of deduction. As you know, we expect to reduce certain of these stakes over time. ","While we're at 7.2% now, we still expect to exceed 8% by the end of this year and have various paths to do so. In fact, based on our current analyst estimates of our earnings for the remainder of 2012 and anticipated actions, including the reduction of our stake in Akbank, we expect to be above 8% even if Morgan Stanley doesn't exercise its option to buy 14% of the MSSB joint venture this year. ","On liquidity, more than 1\/4 of our balance sheet is in cash or liquid securities. And even though the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio doesn't come into effect until 2015, we are at an estimated LCR ratio in excess of 125%. We have already exceeded the proposed requirements. As you can see, our capital and liquidity numbers are amongst the strongest in our industry globally. ","That leads me now to the CCAR process. While several capital actions were approved, such as redeeming certain series of outstanding trust preferred securities, we have to resubmit our capital plan to the Fed. However, we do understand that new factors may need to be taken into account in the resubmission, and that, in any event, we need to understand the process going forward in order to make a determination on what to include in our resubmission. At this point, we expect to receive additional information from the Fed this month, and we're required to submit our revised plan by mid-June. The Fed, then, has 75 days to review the plans, and that time frame stretches almost to the end of the third quarter. ","As we consider our resubmission for this year, we also have to keep in mind that we will be resubmitting the 2013 capital plan to the Fed a short time later. We're having the conversations with the Fed, which will inform what we submit and what we ask for. And obviously, for all of us on the phone, that could range from resubmitting exactly what we asked for before all the way to waiting until the 2013 submission. We, that is the management and the board, will make a decision, which takes all of these factors in account, and of course, we'll have more to say later in the process. In the meantime, what I can promise you is that we expect to keep building our capital. We'll keep executing our strategy, and we'll take every step we can to generate strong returns for our shareholders. ","Finally, as many of you know, we're commemorating our 200th anniversary this year. The central mission of our bank throughout has been to support economic progress. Our historic strengths: facilitating international trade flows, maintaining a strong presence in the world\u2019s largest cities and focusing on the emerging markets are well suited for today's connected world. We see positive signs throughout our businesses, and we're going to serve our clients by putting our unique capabilities to work for them. ","Now let me turn this over to John who will review our results in detail, and then, of course, we'd be happy to take your questions at the end of that.","John C. Gerspach","Okay, thank you, Vikram, and good morning, everyone. Before I go into more detail on the quarter, I'd like to highlight a few significant items affecting our results. ","First, on the revenue slide -- on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion in the first quarter as Citi's credit spreads tightened. We also benefited from a pretax gain of nearly $500 million related to minority investments. On the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at over $500 million. However, repositioning charges declined to $66 million from over $400 million in the prior quarter. ","Now on Slide 4, we show first quarter results. Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share. Excluding CVA\/DVA and the minority investment gain, earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.11 per diluted share. Revenues of $19.4 billion were down 2% versus the prior year on a reported basis. However, excluding CVA\/DVA and the minority investment gain, revenues were up 1% from last year as revenue growth in Citicorp outpaced the decline in Citi Holdings. ","Expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat year-over-year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the significant expense items I just mentioned, operating expenses were up less than 1%. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs of $3 billion were down 5% versus last year. Net credit losses of $4 billion were down 37% year-over-year, including incremental charge-offs of approximately $370 million in the first quarter related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages, which I'll discuss later. ","Excluding these incremental charge-offs, NCLs would have been down 43% from last year. Virtually all of the incremental $370 million of charge-offs was offset by a reserve release specific to the deferred principal amounts, and so the net impact was essentially earnings neutral. Excluding this specific release, the net reserve release in the first quarter would have been roughly $800 million, down from $3.3 billion in the prior year. Citigroup end-of-period loans were up 2% from last year to nearly $650 billion as strong loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to over $900 billion. ","On Slide 5, we show results for Citicorp and Citi Holdings, excluding the impact of CVA\/DVA. Citicorp generated first quarter revenues of $19.4 billion and net income of $5.2 billion. Year-over-year, Citicorp's revenues and expenses grew by 6% and 1%, respectively, with positive operating leverage in every business. Pre-provision net revenues in Citicorp were over $9 billion for the quarter, up 12% from last year. And for the fifth consecutive quarter, we grew loans year-over-year in every business in Citicorp. Citicorp's loans grew 12%, with consumer up 6% and corporate loans up 23%. ","Citi Holdings had revenues of $786 million and a net loss of $1.1 billion. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $209 billion of assets, down $16 billion during the quarter and $86 billion or nearly 30% year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi Holdings accounted for just under 11% of total Citigroup assets. ","On Slide 6, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citicorp's results. Excluding CVA\/DVA, Citicorp's revenues of $19.4 billion in the first quarter were up 6% from the prior year and up 23% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in each of our core businesses. Operating expenses of $10.3 billion were up slightly versus the prior year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of FX and the significant expense items I noted earlier, expenses were up 2% on higher volumes in Consumer Banking and Transaction Services. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. ","Citicorp's net credit losses were $2.2 billion, down over 30% from the prior year, driven by improvement in North America cards. The net loan loss reserve release in Citicorp was significantly lower this quarter, at $588 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. This reflects lower net releases in North America cards, as well as reserve builds in international Consumer Banking and the corporate portfolio, primarily driven by loan growth. Excluding CVA\/DVA, earnings before taxes of $7.4 billion were up 12% versus last year and more than double from the prior quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release. ","On Slide 7, we show results for our global consumer bank. In the first quarter, we generated $10 billion in revenues, up 6% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis. International revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters, reflecting our investments, while in North America, the turnaround continued. Excluding loan loss reserves, we have steadily grown our pretax earnings each quarter for over 2 years, with strong recent growth in North America. ","Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking, which now includes retail partner cards and Citi retail services. Total revenues of $5.2 billion were up 5% versus last year, largely driven by higher gains on sales of mortgage loans. Card revenues declined year-over-year, reflecting spread compression in branded cards due to the continued impact of the look-back provisions of CARD Act and higher promotional balances, as well as lower average card loans. ","Expenses of $2.3 billion were up 3% year-over-year as incremental investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the absence of a litigation reserve in the prior year. Credit costs declined by nearly 1\/3 from last year to $802 million. Net credit losses were down 31% to $1.6 billion, driven by cards, and the net reserve release was $841 million this quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. ","Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew to $1.2 billion from less than $300 million last year. Overall, we continue to see progress in our North America consumer franchise. Average deposits grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 4% year-over-year, including double-digit growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, accounts also grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 5% year-over-year, and purchase sales grew 3%. And in retail services, purchase sales were up 2%. ","Turning to international Consumer Banking on Slide 9. In total, the international consumer businesses achieved positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter, with reported revenue and expense growth of 4% and 2%, respectively. On a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 7% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth continued to reflect improvement in most underlying drivers, offset by spread compression due in part to the continued migration to higher quality borrowers. ","Accounts grew 6% year-over-year, and on a constant dollar basis, we grew average deposits, average loans and purchase sales in every region in the first quarter. Investment sales remained lower than the prior year. However, we saw a rebound from the fourth quarter as retail investors sentiment improved. As I noted, expenses of $2.9 billion were up 5% on a constant dollar basis, driven by volume-related costs as modest incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. ","Credit costs were $799 million in the first quarter as compared to $490 million last year. While net credit losses declined modestly to $649 million, we recorded a net reserve build of $106 million in the first quarter, principally due to portfolio growth versus a net release in the prior year. Earnings before tax, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, grew 15% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. ","On Slide 10, we show growth trends for international Consumer Banking in more detail. On a constant dollar basis, average loans grew 12% over the prior year; average deposits were up 3%; and purchase sales grew 13%. As reported, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have grown both net credit margin and pretax earnings, excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, each quarter for over 2 years. ","Slide 11 shows our Securities and Banking business. Excluding CVA\/DVA, revenues of $6.7 billion were up 6% from last year and more than double the revenues of the prior quarter. Investment banking revenues of $865 million were up 2% from the prior year on strong debt underwriting activity and up 36% sequentially as both equity and debt underwriting rebounded from fourth quarter levels. While M&A activity remains under pressure in the current environment, Citi has gained share in announced M&A year-to-date. x CVA\/DVA, equity market revenues of $902 million were down 18% from the prior year on lower market volumes. However, sequentially, revenues were up significantly on improved trading performance in derivatives and higher cash equities revenues. ","Fixed income market revenues, x CVA\/DVA, of $4.7 billion were up 19% year-over-year and more than double from fourth quarter levels, driven by strong performance in G10 Rates and local markets foreign exchange. Lending revenues of $56 million were down significantly versus prior periods as strong growth in net interest revenues was more than offset by over $500 million of losses on lending hedges in the first quarter, driven by spread tightening. ","Private bank revenues, excluding CVA\/DVA, were $576 million, up 11% versus each of the prior periods on growth in deposit and loan volumes, as well as stronger capital markets activity. Total operating expenses of $3.7 billion were down 2% from last year, driven by efficiency savings, and credit costs were $58 million in the first quarter versus a benefit of $187 million last year. ","Moving to Transaction Services on Slide 12. Revenues of $2.7 billion were up 7% from last year as strong growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions more than offset a decline in Securities and Fund Services. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 11%, driven by strong growth in deposits and trade loans. Securities and Fund Services was down 4% year-over-year. However, revenues grew 5% sequentially as activity levels began to rebound from the fourth quarter. ","The underlying drivers for Transaction Services continue to show strong momentum. End of period trade loans were up nearly 60% from the first quarter of last year, and average deposits were up 6%. Assets under custody were flat year-over-year, but up 4% from the prior quarter. Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 3% versus last year on higher volumes, as incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. Importantly, we achieved positive operating leverage in Transaction Services in the first quarter, and this should be sustainable going forward. Strong revenues, combined with a modest increase in expenses, drove 10% earnings growth year-over-year to over $900 million. ","On Slide 13, we show a 9-quarter trend for Citi Holdings. The reported loss in Citi Holdings was $1 billion in the first quarter, slightly higher versus last year but improved from the prior quarter. Revenues, excluding CVA\/DVA, were down over 50% year-over-year to $786 million, due primarily to lower assets, as well as the absence of positive private equity marks in the prior period. Operating expenses of $1.2 billion were down 16% versus last year, and total credit costs were down 21% to $1.3 billion. ","Looking at Citi Holdings in more detail on Slide 14. Revenues in Brokerage and Asset Management were negative $46 million this quarter, down from last year due to a lower contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, as well as higher funding costs. In Local Consumer Lending, revenues were down 13% versus last year to $1.3 billion, driven by declining loan balances. In the Special Asset Pool, revenues, x CVA\/DVA, were negative $494 million in the first quarter. ","Net interest revenue was negative $102 million as interest-earning assets continued to represent a smaller portion of the Special Asset Pool, while we continued to incur funding costs on the total portfolio. Noninterest revenue, excluding CVA\/DVA, was negative $392 million, down $353 million from prior year, driven by the absence of positive private equity marks in the prior year period, as well as a reserve build of $150 million related to private-label mortgage securitizations. ","Citi Holdings operating expenses were down 16% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, mainly due to declining assets, partially offset by higher legal and related costs. Credit costs were down 21% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Total net credit losses were down 43% to $1.7 billion, reflecting a significant reduction in loans in the Special Asset Pool, as well as a declining loan balance and improved credit trends in Local Consumer Lending. ","On a sequential basis, net credit losses were up $222 million, driven by an increase in North America mortgages. As I noted earlier, in the first quarter, we recorded roughly $370 million of incremental charge-offs related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages, virtually all of which was offset by a specific reserve release. These charge-offs were related to anticipated forgiveness of principal, largely in connection with the national mortgage settlement. Excluding the incremental charge-offs, net credit losses in Citi Holdings would have declined 10% sequentially. In total, we released $576 million of net loan loss reserves in Citi Holdings compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year. ","Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets. We ended the quarter with $209 billion in Citi Holdings or just under 11% of total Citigroup assets. The $16 billion reduction in the first quarter was comprised of roughly $4 billion of asset sales and business dispositions, approximately $11 billion of net runoff and paydowns and $1 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. ","Slide 16 shows the results for the Corporate\/Other segment. Revenues of $500 million were up significantly from last year, mainly driven by the $477 million net gain related to minority investments, which I described earlier. Expenses were up $148 million versus last year, driven by higher legal and related costs. Assets of $312 billion included approximately $121 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $135 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities. ","Turning to total Citigroup expenses on Slide 17. First quarter expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, with both periods including a similar combined level of legal and related costs and repositioning charges of around $600 million. Adjusting for these items, as well as the impact of foreign exchange, core operating expenses grew less than 1% in the first quarter. Incremental investment spending of $400 million was more than offset by nearly $600 million of efficiency savings. We continue to be highly focused on managing our core operating expenses. ","Slide 18 shows total Citigroup net credit losses and loan loss reserves. NCLs continued to improve in the first quarter, down 4% sequentially to $4 billion, and the net loan loss reserve release was $1.2 billion, down from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding the incremental mortgage charge-offs I mentioned earlier of roughly $370 million, NCLs would have been down 13% sequentially and the net reserve release would have been roughly $800 million. We ended the quarter with $29 billion of total loan loss reserves, and our loan loss reserve ratio was 4.5%. ","Consumer NCLs were stable versus the fourth quarter at $4 billion even with the incremental mortgage charge-offs, and we released $1.3 billion in consumer loan loss reserves. Corporate credit costs were $29 million in the first quarter compared to a net benefit of $158 million last quarter as we recorded a net build in reserves this quarter versus a release in the prior period. ","Slide 19 shows our international consumer credit trends, which generally remained stable to improving in Citicorp in the first quarter as loans continued to grow. In Asia, the NCL rate continued to improve in the first quarter and 90-plus-day delinquencies were fairly flat at around 50 basis points. In Latin America, the sequential decline in NCL rate reflects, in part, the absence of adjustments in Central America, which resulted in higher credit losses in the fourth quarter. However, even excluding these adjustments from the prior period, the NCL rate would have been improved sequentially. ","In Local Consumer Lending in Citi Holdings, net credit losses were down quarter-over-quarter on a dollar basis. However, the NCL rate increased on a lower average loan balance. The increase in the 90-plus-day delinquency rate was also primarily driven by the decline in loans. ","On Slide 20, we show the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings split between residential first mortgages and home equity loans. Regarding the incremental charge-offs of about $370 million in North America real estate, approximately $315 million was attributable to residential first mortgages, with the remainder in home equity loans. Excluding this action, total net credit losses for North America real estate in Citi Holdings would have been down slightly versus the prior quarter. ","In residential first mortgages, we ended the quarter with $65 billion of loans, down 14% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental charge-offs in the first quarter, net credit losses would have increased by 4% from the fourth quarter. 90-plus-day delinquencies remained stable in the first quarter at just over $4 billion. However, we continue to watch these trends closely. In home equity loans, we ended the quarter with nearly $39 billion of loans, down 13% from a year ago. Excluding the incremental charge-offs in the first quarter, net credit losses would have been down 5% sequentially, and 90-plus-day delinquencies were also down versus the prior quarter at roughly $900 million. In total, we continue to allocate nearly $10 billion of our total loan loss reserves to North America real estate lending in Citi Holdings. And excluding the incremental NCL action this quarter, we maintained over 30 months of coincident NCL coverage. ","On Slide 21, we show our key capital metrics. Our total Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.2% as of the first quarter, and our Tier 1 common ratio was 12.4%, up 60 basis points from year end. We also grew our tangible book value to $50.90 per share. As Vikram noted, at the end of the first quarter, our estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 7.2%, and this included approximately 120 basis points of impact from our nonconsolidated minority investments in financial companies, including the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture and Akbank. We continue to expect to be above 8% Basel III -- above our 8% Basel III target even if Morgan Stanley does not exercise its option to buy 14% of the JV this year. ","Now let me close with some comments about the outlook. First, Global Consumer Banking, our largest business, continues to produce good growth in revenues and earnings, as well as in key drivers like loans and deposits. Credit quality remains good in Asia and Latin America and continues to improve in the U.S. We produced positive operating leverage across all major regions in consumer banking in the first quarter, although we do not expect to see sustained positive operating leverage in North America until the end of the year. ","Transaction Services also continues to produce strong revenue and earnings growth and had positive operating leverage a quarter earlier than we had previously expected. Treasury and Trade Solutions is driving the growth in Transaction Services, reflecting our ongoing expansion in trade finance, where our unique and large global footprint gives us an unmatched competitive advantage. We are optimistic that Transaction Services will have sustained growth and positive operating leverage in the coming quarters. ","In Securities and Banking, there were a few key takeaways this quarter. First, we believe our underperformance in equities in the second half of last year is behind us. Our proprietary trading business is gone, and our equity derivatives business recovered well, which, we believe, reflects changes we made to that business, including new leadership. Second, our investment banking franchise is beginning to see market share gains in M&A and equity underwriting, while our strong debt underwriting business continues to perform. We think those gains could be an early sign that the investments we made in investment banking resources are beginning to pay off. And finally, our fixed income business continues to perform well and had a particularly strong first quarter. ","Overall, we continue to remain highly focused on managing expenses while still investing in key areas. Expenses were relatively flat year-over-year, and we are still targeting 2012 expenses to be $2.5 billion to $3 billion lower than the 2011 reported numbers, excluding, of course, any large impact resulting from foreign exchange or any significant unanticipated items. ","In Holdings, the wind-down of assets will continue and our primary focus remains the mortgage portfolio. While our portfolio is smaller than our peers\u2019, we continue to believe that mortgages represent the greatest risk to any major bank balance sheet and a number of headwinds remain. More broadly, while the macro environment has improved compared to the second half of last year, there is still much uncertainty, which has been underscored by the recent spate of mixed economic data and rekindled eurozone fears, so we will continue to manage risk carefully and to maintain a strong balance sheet. We remain very optimistic about our prospects given our client franchise, our unique mix of businesses and our unparalleled footprint. ","Vikram and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Curious in the whole CCAR process. I'm curious what you've learned now that you've gotten some qualitative impact detail back from the Fed and what you learned on the international loss rates, how the Fed feels about them and if you've made any -- have any thoughts on the way you manage the business differently going forward as a result of the CCAR process.","Vikram S. Pandit","Yes, let me address that, Glenn. First, the one comment I'd make is if you take a look at CCAR and the stress test and kind of understanding, as you know well, stress tests are tail-risk events and tail-risk events implicitly tell you what kind of capital you should have against businesses. If you think about it that way, the weightings coming out of the CCAR process are very different than the weightings that come out of the Basel III risk-weighted asset process. That's a significant learning for all of us in the industry. Another way of saying that is risk-weighted assets in Basel III overweight risk in trading businesses, while the CCAR is much more in line with what true risk might be. And on the consumer side, the CCAR weightings are higher than the risk weightings on the Basel III process. So for all of us, obviously, the questions are around, well, how do you dovetail the 2? And we've always been of the point of view at Citi that our capital charges should be higher our risk capital or risk-weighted assets. And frankly, risk capital's shape, not the magnitude, but the shape of risk capital is much more in line with where the CCAR comes out than where the Basel III numbers are. And I think that's probably the single biggest determinant of where you'd want to put capital to some extent. Although it's early, I can also tell you, you can't necessarily take one year CCAR as given because as we've all learned, these stress tests can keep changing. Scenarios will change, but it is an indication that when you think about capital allocation in your businesses, you need to think about not only Basel, but risk capital, CCAR being one of the measures. That's the big picture kind of issue. On the narrower issues, Glenn, we continue to talk to the Fed, and we're going to continue to do that. We stand by our numbers, our stress test numbers, and we stand by our submission, and there's a lot more we need to do to get closer to understanding exactly how the next part of the process is going to work. And stay tuned, we'll have more to say later.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. On Holdings, so many moving parts this quarter with partner cards moving out and all the things that you noted on your prepared remarks. But long story short, revenues are shrinking faster than expenses, and we're still at about $1 billion a quarter of run rate loss. Is there anything besides just the mortgage world getting better that can improve that loss rate over the next couple of quarters?","John C. Gerspach","Glenn, as we said in the prepared remarks, a lot of the interest-earning assets now from the Special Asset Pool have shrunk. So what we're left with in the Special Asset Pool now would be much more episodic revenue events, private equity marks up or down. And so I'm not quite sure that you're going to see a great relation between -- a tie-in between revenues and expenses. As we've been saying, we think that expenses should come down in Holdings as the assets come down. And if you adjust for -- as we gave you last quarter, if you take a look at what we've done on a year-over-year basis and you take a look at trailing 12 months, we've taken assets down somewhere around 29%, almost 30%. And adjusted operating expenses, removing litigation reserves and the whatnot, are down roughly 22% over the same time frame. So again, we're bringing expenses down roughly in connection with the asset reduction.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, cool. Last one. If you look at your expense slide and you took that core operating costs running a little bit below $47 billion run rate, that's -- if I remember the math correctly, that's below the range of the 2 to 3 -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion below last year's operating run rate. Is there anything in particular that's running better? Because this was the -- first quarter's typically a pretty good investment bank quarter, so if anything, the thought was maybe first quarter's going to be on the high side of expenses, but it wasn't. Not complaining, it's a good thing, but just curious.","John C. Gerspach","As we said going into the year, we felt that we could bring the reported numbers for this year down $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We still think that we're on track for that. We talked to you in the past about our ongoing program to generate efficiency savings of between 3% and 5% on our businesses last year. For the full year, we ran $1.9 billion. You see that we already generated $600 million of savings in the first quarter. So we think that we've got good expense discipline in place, and at this point in time, we're going to stay with our full year view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One follow-up to Glenn's question on Holdings, John. I guess, you still -- in terms of your guidance, you still expect over the life of Holdings for the existing reserves and PPNR to be sufficient to absorb the losses, something you said before.","John C. Gerspach","Yes, John, absolutely.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so you're losing $1 billion a quarter now, but that comes down as the charge-offs come down and I guess...","John C. Gerspach","Let me be specific because the guidance that we've given in the past and the guidance that I'll reiterate is that for the Local Consumer Lending, the combination of the PPNR, plus the existing reserves, will more than offset the lifetime NCL that we have.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Over the life of all of that, all of your assets?","John C. Gerspach","Correct.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And on the mortgage, additional charge-offs that you had this quarter in Holdings, in LCL, is there a onetime catch-up component to that on these TDRs? Or is that something that episodically will come up again as you go through these restructurings?","John C. Gerspach","Well, this is, if you want to call it a catch-up, it's really an advance of where we see -- what we see happening under the national mortgage settlement, where we will be generating a certain amount of principal forgiveness in response to our commitments under the national mortgage settlements. And so when we looked, there's deferred principal on some of our modified loans that will be forgiven as we get into this process. And so what you can expect, as most institutions get into the national mortgage settlement, should be an increase in both net credit losses, as well as reserve releases in their mortgage business. And what you see in our results today is basically the first installment of what you could expect to see on our part.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And that you said that, that was P&L neutral, but the provisions still went up in Holdings. Is that just that you had less reserve release elsewhere in Holdings?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, that's exactly right, John.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Another question on Holdings, just in terms of the Smith Barney Morgan Stanley joint venture. Just curious why does it not show up on your income statement as making money, even though it makes money for Morgan Stanley and it's a business that, obviously, we'd expect is profitable. Is there some accounting going on there, I guess?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, that's exactly right. There's accounting that goes on there. When we account for it, it's not just the equity pickup that we have. We also reflect the funding costs that we have on the investment itself. There's some intangibles that we created in connection with the sale that we continue to amortize. So our reported numbers off the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture are more than just the reported results of the entity itself.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And given the drag on Basel III capital that presents, is there any reason why you wouldn't be open to selling the entire stake if Morgan Stanley was? Does that just come down to price?","John C. Gerspach","Well, we have our investment in Morgan Stanley's -- in the joint venture, in Holdings, so by definition, we're looking to exit that business. It's not part of our core operations going forward. Having said that, the capital numbers we're at and the progress we're making in the business also suggest that there is not a need to do that either, which is important to appreciate and understand. We've got plenty of time.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. Like you mentioned you'd be above 8% even including it by the end of this year.","John C. Gerspach","That's right.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, and then just on the DTA itself, John, can you update us where that was at quarter end and whether you consumed anything this quarter in terms of DTA and just as you look out, what your expectations are, maybe to capture some DTA in 2012?","John C. Gerspach","John, actually the DTA for this quarter actually went up by about $400 million, and that reflects 2 specific headwinds that we had in the quarter. Number one, there is a component of the DTA that is expressed in foreign currency, and the FX impact on that particular asset caused a $200 million increase in that portion of the DTA. Secondly, virtually all of the CVA and DVA losses are incurred either in North America or in vehicles that consolidate into the North America consolidated tax return. And therefore, with those CVA losses, we actually generated an additional $500 million of DTA, so that's 2 items that add up to a $700 million headwind on DVA -- on DTA in the quarter. Absent those 2 items, we would have consumed about $300 million worth of DTA.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Any outlook in terms of this year, in terms of what you'd like to do aspirationally in terms of digesting some of that?","John C. Gerspach","Well, we don't anticipate consuming a lot of DTA this year. That is not something that is with our plan this year, but that is going to be highly dependent upon the profitability of our North America businesses and our ability to continue to wind down Holdings.","John E. McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And that's the long-term driver just getting more profitable in the U.S. and having that Holdings loss go down?","John C. Gerspach","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to start off with just a question on North America Consumer Banking. Clearly, a real positive that you were able to generate the positive operating leverage there in the quarter well ahead of when you were talking about doing it. But of course, there were some things that might not be completely sustainable there, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the order of magnitude of the improvement in the mortgage revenues because of the gains on sale.","John C. Gerspach","Yes, we had roughly close to $500 million worth of gains on sale in mortgages this quarter. So again, that certainly added to the revenue stream in that business.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And could you talk little bit about the dynamic in the market that -- besides the increase, obviously, in just in demand, but what was driving the spreads there and how sustainable might that trend be?","John C. Gerspach","Well, the spreads did increase this quarter. Most of that, for our purposes, we've shifted our production to be much more based on our branches. So we use our branches now much more as a source of those mortgages, and we tend to get better production statistics out of mortgages originated in the branches than we do from third party.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it sounds like what you're trying to say is, that some of that spread improvement is presumably sustainable because of mixed shift in how you actually originate the mortgages.","John C. Gerspach","Well, as we shift the production to retail branches, some of the spread improvement should be sustainable. But I think anything to do with mortgages right now is one of these things that you have to take a look at with a certain amount of caution.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. All right, moving on to your ratings. Obviously, Moody's has talked about proposed changes to its rating methodology, and there's the potential for a downgrade to as low as Baa at the holding company level, and I just wanted to know what are you doing to mitigate some of the potential impacts from that happening, specifically with respect to your OTC derivatives business.","John C. Gerspach","Guy, that's a good topic. But I think it's important to remember that the Moody's review is -- it's really an industry-wide re-weighting. It's not just focused on Citi, and it's an industry-wide re-rating globally at this point in time. As we take a look at it, we've got, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, incredibly strong capital and robust liquidity. And as we think about it, as our investors and our counterparties, it's -- people are less and less solely relying on ratings of a single agency in making their decisions. Some might note changes in ratings from Moody's, but at this point in time, we don't think that the impact on us would be material. We think that we have prepared our business for whatever impact could be out there.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if I can just follow up on that thinking specifically about impact on derivatives businesses. To what extent do you think you can mitigate whatever impact there might be on that part of your business by novating [ph] derivative trades to the bank from the broker? Is there any reason that we would think that actions like that might be precluded in any way?","John C. Gerspach","When you get into those types of movements, they generate their own complexities, and so that's not something that we're looking at right now.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Okay, final question that I have for you is just with respect to reps and warranties. You obviously showed some numbers in the appendix, I guess, to your slides about how those evolved during the quarter. And clearly, on the private label side, those are up. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. And also, should we relate that increase in some of those demands essentially to the litigation reserve build that I think we can detect in the Corporate and Other segment?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, I wouldn't do any great linkage as far as trying to link reserve builds in one area to reserve builds in another, but that's up to you. Regarding -- from the mortgage -- from the reps and warranties slide that we've got back in the back of the earnings deck, as we've said, most of our experience to date has been in receiving rep and warranty claims from the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and we've built up a pretty good reserve on that. We continue to believe that the private label securitizations, different from the whole loan sales that we've done with the GSEs, those private label securitizations will largely be settled through litigation. But as we get claims -- specific rep and warranty claims in, we will take a look at them and then add to our reserves on an episodic basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question is the $0.8 billion in nonaccrual -- second liens that you moved into nonaccrual this quarter, was your existing reserves fully reflected that move? And was that just for the regulatory shift?","John C. Gerspach","Yes. It's actually -- we shifted about $840 million or thereabouts of junior lien -- high-risk seconds, junior liens into the nonaccrual status in response to some regulatory guidance that the entire industry got. And all of that was already reflected in our reserves.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Terrific. And then, moving on to MSSB, thanks for the disclosure on that 120 bps for MSSB and Akbank. What I was curious about was if as we think about the sale from MSSB, and obviously, timing is a big question mark and price. But if all of MSSB is sold, would that be completely dollar for dollar, net of any gains or losses that all accrete to capital, that full amount that you carry via the JV?","John C. Gerspach","The simple answer to your question is yes.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, how would we think about the sale -- corresponding sale of deposits to MS? What are the prices generally that are tied to brokered deposits and brokerage accounts? And how much of that is a gain?","John C. Gerspach","I don't want to go into any specifics of what might be. As we get into it and we have something to announce on any of these transactions, we'll let you know.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Is it right, though, to think that maybe those sales or deposits could be a somewhat meaningful portion or unlikely to be so?","John C. Gerspach","Those deposits would be part of the business. They're part of the original agreement that we made, and we'll have more to say about the joint venture if and when there's anything to say about any potential sale.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Last one for me. There were some reports -- some press reports that some banks were considering securitizing trade finance receivables. Is that something that Citi had looked at? And if so, could you sort of walk us through maybe how the economics -- how that would change the economics of that business for you?","John C. Gerspach","Well, we like that business. Again, as we look at our balance sheet, we have got -- as Vikram said in his remarks -- 26% of the balance sheet right now tied up in cash and liquid securities. We have over $200 billion of cash. So we still have capacity to grow loans on our books. Having said that, any time you have asset concentrations, you're always looking at ways of reducing those or potentially reducing those concentrations. And so that could be a potential use of something like a securitization. But it's not something that we really need to engage in at this point in time.","Vikram S. Pandit","But that's not where we are today either, on the concentration point. Don't forget these are very short-term assets, I mean. So on the securitization basis, it creates a lot of other complications. The best use for some of the deposit and cash we have on hand is these trade finance receivables.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay. And actually, I'm sorry, I have one more quick one here. You had indicated that the $3.7 billion expense base in Securities and Banking reflects efficiency saves. So is it a good idea for us to assume that, that's a decent run rate now going forward?","John C. Gerspach","I don't want to get into specific forecasting of individual business run rates. We'll stay with the guidance that, overall this year, you should expect the full firm expense base to reflect $2.5 billion to $3 billion lower than 2011.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Quick question on the deposits. You guys were up, on a period-end basis anyway, $40 billion, a lot of that internationally and in the institutional side. I would have thought you would have seen outflows after the big flight to safety trade in the fourth quarter. So what's driving that? Was there anything episodic about the end of the quarter? Or was that just good sort of new business wins?","John C. Gerspach","No, most of it was -- I'd say it's continuing of existing business. We did change our deposit pricing slightly at the end of the quarter, particularly to deal with competitive pressures in Asia. But that would be the only place where we modestly changed deposit pricing, and we still think that we are well below where the industry is. So this is just good customer activity that we have at this point in time. What we're focused on is continuing to improve the mix of our deposits. And when you take a look at that $900 billion of deposits, about 70% of that would be core operating accounts. So we feel pretty good about the deposit mix.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, fair enough. And maybe if we look at fixed income, we didn't really talk about that, but you guys were up 20% almost year-over-year. Sounded like JPMorgan was down modestly. Is that simply a function of your mix being more leveraged to macro strategies like rates in FX? Or do you think there was some market share pickup from European banks pulling back? And how do we think about it in the context of Moody's shot across the bow, if you guys are still doing quite a bit of business in the derivatives space? It seems like it hasn't really affected your ability to grab share.","John C. Gerspach","No. Derivatives are not a large part of our business. To the extent that we're involved in derivatives, it's particularly flow product, as opposed to having an out-weighted segment on OTC or structured derivatives. That's not a big part of our business. So we just -- our franchise performed very well this quarter, and we're very happy with it.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Was it more a function of positioning? Or do you think there was some share gains?","John C. Gerspach","I can't comment on share gain at this point in time after one quarter.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, fair enough. And one last question on the expense side. You guys are targeting $2.5 billion to $3 billion. I just want to make sure I understand what the base is. Are we excluding the legal costs in the first quarter to look at the run rate? Or is that inclusive of that higher legal cost in the first quarter in terms of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion?","John C. Gerspach","What we've said is that excluding unanticipated large items. There's nothing necessarily in the first quarter that I would put into that category at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thanks for the commentary on Basel III, and I think you were helpful in giving us some of the deductions from the capital point of view. But any commentary on the increase in RWAs, as well as how you think you can mitigate that over the next couple of years, to be helpful?","John C. Gerspach","What we had said, I believe, is that our target for the end of this year would be to be at a Basel III RWA multiplier of like 1.35x Basel I risk-weighted assets. And we're already operating slightly below that, so we think we've made some good progress already on the mitigations, although we still think that there's room for further mitigations as we go along.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And how well -- as you look out more than just the near term, how much can you bring them in line with Basel III, do you think -- or sorry, Basel III and Basel I [indiscernible], like how much can they converge?","John C. Gerspach","Well, the good thing is, from our consumer and our Transaction Services businesses, and I think we mentioned this in the past, we can -- we think that given the structure of our business, we can bring those amounts pretty much into parity. I'm not going to tell you we can do it exactly dollar for dollar, but the multiplier would be in the point 0 something range. So we feel pretty good about the assets in consumer and Transaction Services, and so the area of focus becomes Securities and Banking. And again, when you take a look at our construct of our Securities and Banking business, we think that, that fits well into a Basel III environment also. So previously, we would have said that the Citicorp businesses in total would have had a Basel III multiplier of 1.2. So in other words, of that 1.35x that I had given you for the full firm, about 1.2x would be for Citicorp. And looking at our business today, we're already slightly below that again for the Citicorp segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of things. First, your comment about -- and it was earlier question about the mortgage sales kind of driving or smaller gains on sale driving a lack of positive operating leverage perhaps, what was the -- kind of where did you start the first quarter versus where you started the second quarter in terms of your pipeline on that? I mean, does it -- do you have a smaller amount available for sale for the second quarter?","John C. Gerspach","No, no, no, Moshe, let me just try to be -- I want to make sure that we're going back to the same starting point. And what I mentioned is that we had $500 million or thereabouts of gain on sale in the first quarter. And what I further said was that we're just not ready yet to declare that we're going to have sustainable positive operating leverage in North America for the balance of the year until we get to the end of the year, as we had previously stated. Most of that is because in the first quarter, we also benefited from the lack of a litigation reserve that we had taken in the first quarter of last year. So if I pull that litigation reserve out, we actually had expense growth in North America year-over-year, as you would expect, since we are still in the process of investing in that business.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So it's more -- it's just a normal investment in the business as opposed to...","John C. Gerspach","Yes, yes. You shouldn't read into that anything, that we suddenly see our mortgage origination pipeline or mortgage modification pipeline or mortgage refinance pipeline suddenly drying up.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just on Holdings and the expense change. I mean, I understand the 1 or 2 things that you highlighted. It still seems like a very large drop. And how sustainable is that because obviously, that would, at this level, would be much more favorable?","John C. Gerspach","Well, don't forget, if you're looking at sequentially, that drop sequentially would include the fact that in the fourth quarter we had some rather sizable litigation reserves taken in Holdings, and we didn't repeat that at the same level in the first quarter of this year.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And that was in the neighborhood of what, a couple of hundred million dollars?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, I don't have the exact amount in front of me, Moshe, but...","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys give us some color -- you've done a good job with the net interest margin over the last 12 months, can you give us some color on how you see it shaping up for this year?","John C. Gerspach","I'm sorry, Gerard, but you broke up just a little bit. I want to make sure we got the right question.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. On the net interest margin, you guys have done a good job keeping it around that 2.88 to 2.90. Can you give us some color on where you see it going as we move forward?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, when you take a look at our net interest margin, we had, I think, previously said that we had thought that the net interest margin might decline this quarter. And there's a couple of things that are working through the numbers, one of which is, from quarter-to-quarter, we did rebuild our trading book, and we get lower yields on the trading book. That actually cost us about 4 basis points on NIM against what we would have thought would have been a 6-basis-point-or-more decline. But at the same point in time, we've benefited from lower funding costs of about 2 basis points. And then, we also had a reserve release in our Japan Citi finance business that benefited us for about 2 basis points. So basically, you had a 4 basis point decline on the rebuild of the trading book and then 2 basis point good guys. So we basically held NIM at 2.90. I still think that in the second quarter, as we get a little bit more of a build in the trading book, and what I'm assuming is going to be an absence now of the good guys as far as the Japan reserve release, what you're likely to see is a slight decline in NIM in the second quarter, and NIM could decline in the second quarter to perhaps 2.85 thereabouts. And after that, what we would expect is that NIM should either be stable or perhaps grow slightly from there on out.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Another question. You guys gave us good disclosure on the GIIPS exposure that you have. And if I read the numbers correctly from the fourth quarter, it looks like your unfunded commitments, which is on Slide 33, came in at $8.1 billion this quarter, and your corporate's unfunded was $7.5 billion. Last quarter, I think it was $6.7 billion. Can you share with us -- I assume those are multinational companies, good credits. Are you taking market share? How are you winning that new business?","John C. Gerspach","I wouldn't say that we're taking market share. What we're trying to do is support our customers in those countries, and that's something that we've said all along as we approached our exposure to the GIIPS. We're much more focused on direct exposure to sovereigns and FIs. We intend to be there for our customers.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And then, finally, coming back to the CCAR process, you guys mentioned that by mid-June, you'll resubmit, and then the Fed has 75 days to respond. If you resubmit before mid-June, let's say, it's end of May, early June, will the Fed still have 75 days from mid-June? Or can we hear something earlier from the Fed?","Vikram S. Pandit","No, they have 75 days. And I want you also to know that this is going to be based off of March end numbers and we've got -- from what we understand, we've got to go through another full stress test in our resubmission. So this is the time frame. I think, it's a realistic time frame for everybody to be aware of.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I think you also mentioned you guys will decide whether you want to do it versus just waiting until next year. Will you all disclose to us that, yes, you have resubmitted it? Or how will we find out about that?","Vikram S. Pandit","We'll have our quarterly calls. We'll let you know next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is on this whole CCAR thing. Vikram, you just said you'll be resubmitting it based off of March numbers. Do you know if the assumptions that the Fed had used, would those change at all?","Vikram S. Pandit","Well, that's exactly, Vivek, what we're waiting for. Those are exactly the conversations we're having. And as I said, we are likely to get more information from them between now and the end of the month, so it's still early in the process. And I wish I could share more with you, but that's kind of where we are.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. A couple of other quick ones, probably for John. John, the mortgage gain on sale, just to go back to that, which you had about $500-ish million this quarter. Your originations went down about 35% linked quarter, yet your gains went up quite a bit. Was any of that coming from MSR hedge gains that went up?","John C. Gerspach","No, no, no. When you take a look at the gains that we get, gains get booked when we lock in rates, so that timing isn't always associated with how we report the origination results.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. Next one, LCL expenses, you were down to a little under $1 billion, a pretty sharp reduction. Should we assume sustainability at these levels? Or is there anything at all that's nonrecurring in that?","John C. Gerspach","No, I don't believe there's anything nonrecurring in the first quarter expense level. As I mentioned to another questioner, the sequential drop, though, has to do, at least a certain amount, with the lack of litigation reserves that we had taken in the fourth quarter.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, right. I guess I'm just assuming you won't have to keep taking litigation reserves every quarter, but I guess we'll have to wait for that.","John C. Gerspach","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, just, first of all, John, in terms of the recent data we've heard coming out of Asia and China, specifically in terms of the potential slowing of growth there, has that presented you any concerns about some of your expectations for revenue and revenue or loan growth coming out of your Asian platform?","Vikram S. Pandit","Well, let me answer that this way. One is that when you look at these economies, there is still substantial amount of growth. Even if the growth possibilities could be a little bit less than what they might have been, these are significant growing -- significantly growing countries. They're also countries that don't have the same consumer market penetration and consumer loan penetration as we do in the U.S., so there is a secular aspect to this as well. And then the kind of clientele we serve is a clientele that is well inside that growth -- that secular growth aspect as well. And so a lot of what we're seeing is really driven by what's happening in the markets. For example, in the investment sales area, Europe has an impact on whether or not you see the right kind of robust investment sales. On the other hand, on the loan growth side, we still continue to see from the kind of people, kind of customers that we have as clients, a good amount of loan demand.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just, John, a quick one on the home equity reclassification. It appears that just given the numbers in the supplement that most of that, about 2\/3 of that, was in Holdings. Is that correct?","John C. Gerspach","Actually the entirety of the 840 that we moved in on accrual was all in Holdings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman of Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","John, just a couple of quick ones. Not to beat to death the expense question, but it just was interesting or I found it curious that really across the board your numbers were quite a bit lower than what we've seen or did see in 2011, whether it's the legal, the cost saves or the incremental investment spend. So with your outlook for the year, I mean, how should we think about just the trend? It seems to me that given the numbers this quarter, it's more of kind of back-end loaded, if you will.","John C. Gerspach","I think you would say it's slightly back-end loaded in order to get there. And if you go back to what we had said going into the year, we had said that the heaviest amount of incremental investment spending was behind us, and so that is clearly the case. But what continues is our continued refocus on driving those efficiency saves out of each of the businesses. So we will get somewhere between 3% and 5% efficiency saves out of each of the businesses. So that level of roughly $600 million or so of efficiency saves that we produced in the first quarter should be sustainable throughout the year, and what you should see as the year progresses would be less growth in the investment build.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because, again, I mean it dropped off to $600 million this quarter. I think last quarter it was nearly $2 billion. And just the delta...","John C. Gerspach","No, no, no. The $1.9 billion that we had, that was for all of last year. That was the reengineering saves, the efficiency saves for all of last year.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And do I read anything into the fact that you dropped the word episodic on the legal side?","John C. Gerspach","No, don't. You shouldn't read anything into that at all.","Vikram S. Pandit","Ultimately, all legal is episodic.","John C. Gerspach","Yes, I'm sorry, I didn't go back and see what we had called it in the last time.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just thought perhaps there was a couple of some of those miscellaneous items that were now behind you.","John C. Gerspach","No.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just quickly on the -- between LCL and the Special Asset Pool, I think you mentioned like on some of the -- it was the private equity or whatnot just in terms of the marks, could you just remind us what the marks were this quarter, and whether it was in the Special Asset Pool or LCL, how that compared to last quarter?","John C. Gerspach","Any private equity mark that we take will be in the Special Asset Pool because that's where we have the private equity investments. You can see that actually, you can see the private equity investments on one of the schedules that we've got at the back of the earnings deck. It's somewhere on Page 43, 44, somewhere in there. And -- but I'm not going to comment on any specific marks that we've taken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quickies. One on the liquidity, you indicated huge amount of liquidity 26% or so of assets. Could you just give us a sense as to how much you could drive that down if you had all the lending -- high-quality lending that you could do out there?","John C. Gerspach","Well, I would say that on a normalized basis, if and when we ever get to a normalized environment, you'd probably have -- that 26% would be something in the high teens, probably -- certainly no more than 20%. So that gives you a range right there.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. And that is, in part, going to be a function of the LCL book coming down as well because I'm assuming you're having to hold liquidity against that portfolio. Is that right or no?","John C. Gerspach","Well, we hold liquidity against our entire -- the entirety of our book.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, I'm just -- okay. Then on LCL, are you in process of considering the buy-to-rent program that many others are -- in other words, pooling together some of the properties that you have for sale to private equity or alternatively renting some of the homes that you have right now as per the recent Fed rulings that allowed banks to do that?","John C. Gerspach","Well, I don't see us becoming landlords, Betsy. But at the same point in time, you know that the sales of mortgages has been a particular focus of ours. And so you can assume that we will continue to explore various means of taking those mortgages off our books. And if we can find people who would like to buy those mortgages and think that they've got other ways of utilizing the properties, we'll be happy to have those conversations.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, lastly, there was an article on the FT today about counterparty exposures, and I think we all know there was some regulation that was put out a while back on how much exposure anybody could have to counterparties and for the larger institutions cap out at 10% of capital. So a suggestion out there today that many of the big 5 are above this 10% limit. Just wondering if that makes sense to you, if there's anything that you're doing to try to either limit that exposure or work with regulators to understand what the impact could be on the industry.","John C. Gerspach","Much more the latter. I mean, let's remember, it's not regulation, it's a proposed rule. So it is not regulation as yet, and so as any proposed rule, the proposed rule comes out and then there is a period where both we and various industry associations comment on it and engage in meaningful dialogue with the regulators so that they -- so we can just make sure that they fully understand some of the impacts of what they're proposing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad of KBW.","David J. Konrad - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on FICC given its strength this quarter. I know it's too soon given not everyone's reported results to figure out market share, but can you give us any color on client flow versus marks in the inventory or how -- the bottom line strength for the quarter?","John C. Gerspach","Yes, I'd say that the FICC performance that we had in the first quarter had very good -- had good client flow. Importantly, volumes overall in FICC were probably up on the order of 10%, so we did see incremental volumes in the market, good 2-way flow from clients, so it was a good quarter from a client point of view, not heavily marked by -- or not heavily weighted towards recovery marks in any way. It was good solid performance by the guys in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On Slide 3, where you have the significant P&L items and you have the expense items related to legal and repositioning, would that be recorded in Corporate\/Other?","John C. Gerspach","Not necessarily. We -- most of what we've booked this quarter from a legal and related would be in Corp\/Other, but it's not exclusively. It's probably heavily weighted towards Corp\/Other, and then the remainder would be in Holdings.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And the repositioning charges last quarter, was that in Corporate\/Other?","John C. Gerspach","No. The repositioning charges would be in the businesses that are actually engaged in the repositioning, so every one of those repositioning charges would be in a business.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So maybe take half of the decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in legal, and so maybe it's about $150 million in Corporate\/Other?","John C. Gerspach","No. I was giving you an answer, Michael, on the $545 million itself. Of that $545 million, most of that is in Corp\/Other. Last quarter, most of the charge would have been in Holdings as opposed to in Corp\/Other.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. What I'm getting to is Slide 16, the Corporate\/Other. And you had almost $800 million of expenses, and that was up quite a bit from the fourth quarter.","John C. Gerspach","Exactly. That's because, this quarter, we would have had -- as I said, the bulk of almost $400 million of that $545 million would be in Corp\/Other. Whereas last quarter, I can't tell you off the top of my head how much of the $832 million would have been in Corp\/Other, but it would have been a very small amount.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","What I'm eventually trying to get to is if you spread the Corporate\/Other revenues and expenses over the 3 key areas of Citicorp: Global Consumer, Securities and Banking and Transaction Services, how would the operating metrics look if you were to do that?","John C. Gerspach","It would still look very strong for the quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","One last, the ROA as reported in your supplement for Citicorp is 1.25%. And I think if you overlay Corporate\/Other to the ROA that you report there, then the ROA goes down to 93 basis points.","John C. Gerspach","And I think that if you further adjust that for both the asset sales and the CVA\/DVA, you come up with a number of like 1.07%.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, when you look at that 1.07% versus your target of 1.25% to 1.5%, what areas are underperforming relative to where you eventually want to get?","John C. Gerspach","I think one of the single largest contributing factors is still the low interest rate environment. When we set the target of 1.25% to 1.50%, I mean let's be fair, we actually had an upper limit on it. We were anticipating an environment where interest rates would be close to 0. So the biggest piece of work that we have yet to do is to get back to a more normal interest rate environment. I think you'll also see the share of our consumer business as a percentage of overall Citicorp, plus Corp\/Other, both revenue and net income grow from here out. Then, the consumer businesses, in total, produce much higher ROA type of numbers. So it's not necessarily, at this point in time, that things are underperforming. It's a matter of we need to get some more growth in consumer, which, again, we've laid out as what we're trying to do. And secondly, we need to get back to a more normal interest rate environment.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then last unrelated, with the EMEA loans are up a little bit, the way I'm looking at it from the fourth quarter, does that make sense to be expanding those loans? And are you simply being opportunistic because others are retreating? Or what's happening there?","John C. Gerspach","Michael, I got to tell you, I just -- I don't have an EMEA loan story in my head right now. Maybe if you give John or Susan a call in Investor Relations, they can impact. But don't forget, when we talk about EMEA, EMEA is a much larger region than just western Europe. It includes the Middle East and Africa, as well as eastern Europe. So I'm sure that the growth is probably in those areas. But I just don't have that on the top of my head.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You had mentioned just, and this was news to me, that you were going to resubmit the stress test on March numbers. Aren't your Basel capital numbers kind of up 40 basis points? So I mean, wouldn't that in and of itself just kind of, with the same assumptions both on stresses and on capital, kind of put you 40 basis points higher? Or is there something I'm missing?","Vikram S. Pandit","Actually, it's 60 basis points. That's the starting point on that. But that's the math. We understand that. Having said that, Moshe, what I said was, there's a possibility we -- and quite a significant possibility, we actually may have to run a real new stress test, and we don't know the scenarios either. And so it's going to be very hard to look at this on a apples-to-apples basis, and frankly I just don't have that information right now to go through it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","John Andrews","Great, thank you. This is John Andrews again. We'd like to thank you for listening today. The call will be available on replay later today on our website. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations Department here. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call.
